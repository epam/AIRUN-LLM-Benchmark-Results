evaluation_steps:
  accuracy:
  - Verify all Angular.js anti-patterns are correctly identified (e.g., large controllers, lack of services)
  - Confirm architectural issues like tight coupling are accurately highlighted
  - Ensure performance bottlenecks are correctly identified (e.g., inefficient data handling)
  - Validate readability issues are properly assessed (e.g., unclear variable names, complex logic)
  - Check that maintainability problems are properly identified (e.g., code duplication, lack of modularity)
  - Verify accessibility concerns are correctly pointed out (e.g., missing ARIA attributes)
  - Ensure specific code examples are provided for each identified issue
  - Confirm suggestions follow modern Angular.js best practices
  - Validate that documentation improvements are appropriately suggested
  - Check that all recommended solutions address the root cause of the issues
  - Ensure the analysis recognizes the outdated Angular.js patterns that should be updated
  - Verify the recommendations are practical and implementable within the existing codebase
  completeness:
  - Verify analysis covers all required aspects (readability, maintainability, performance, accessibility, best practices, documentation)
  - Confirm analysis of the REST factory includes evaluating the API endpoint organization
  - Ensure evaluation of the Page factory includes assessment of state management approach
  - Verify analysis of the Users factory includes recommendations for improved data security
  - Confirm the pageCtrl.js controller is thoroughly analyzed for code complexity and size issues
  - Ensure HTML template is evaluated for proper binding and structural organization
  - Verify error handling patterns are assessed throughout the codebase
  - Confirm data flow and component communication patterns are evaluated
  - Ensure localStorage usage is analyzed for potential issues
  - Verify form handling and validation approaches are assessed
  - Confirm callback nesting and promise handling are evaluated for maintainability
  - Ensure that the analysis includes recommendations for migration to modern frameworks where appropriate
