evaluation_steps:
  accuracy:
  - Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type
  - Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls
  - Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured
  - Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses
  - Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters
  - Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate
  - Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback
  - Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing
  - Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices
  - Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code
  - Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests
  - Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns
  completeness:
  - Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name
  - Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests
  - Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query
  - Verify that search results update dynamically as users type
  - Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found
  - Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design
  - Verify that the character list displays search results after API response
  - Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed
  - Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props
  - Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities
