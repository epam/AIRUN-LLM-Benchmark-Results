evaluation_steps:
  accuracy:
  - Verify that all React imports use React 18.x compatible syntax
  - Confirm that all components use functional component syntax with hooks instead of class components
  - Verify that Redux Toolkit's createSlice is used for state management
  - Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for all props, state, and Redux store
  - Confirm that the application uses immutable state updates in reducers
  - Verify that nanoid is used for ID generation instead of custom UUID implementation
  - Ensure the application uses React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate
  - Verify that useCallback is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Confirm that localStorage handling is implemented in a modern way
  - Ensure the code follows consistent naming conventions throughout the application
  - Verify that proper error handling is implemented where necessary
  - Confirm that the Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware
  - Ensure that React.lazy is used for code splitting where appropriate
  - Verify that the codebase has no TODOs remaining
  - Confirm that the Redux Provider wraps the application entry point
  - Ensure strict TypeScript type checking is implemented throughout the application
  completeness:
  - Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed
  - Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter
  - Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos
  - Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted

  - Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence
  - Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state
