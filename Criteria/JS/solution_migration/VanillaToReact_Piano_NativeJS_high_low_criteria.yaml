evaluation_steps:
  accuracy:
  - Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration
  - Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure
  - Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks
  - Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)
  - Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels
  - Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events
  - Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment
  - Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility
  - Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns
  - Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate
  - Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations
  - Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application
  completeness:
  - Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'
  - Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons
  - Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)
  - Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes
  - Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked
  - Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)
  - Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes
  - Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked
  - Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes
  - Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly
  - Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys
  - Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information
