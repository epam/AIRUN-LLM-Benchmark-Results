evaluation_steps:
  accuracy:
  - Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)
  - Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints
  - Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation
  - Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls
  - Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection
  - Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations
  - Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies
  - Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization
  - Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls
  - Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate
  - Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage
  - Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested
  - Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible
  completeness:
  - Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources
  - Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly
  - Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly
  - Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods
  - Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller
  - Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation
  - Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction
  - Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality
  - Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)
  - Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types
  - Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly
  - Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions
  - Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components
  - Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling
  - Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality
