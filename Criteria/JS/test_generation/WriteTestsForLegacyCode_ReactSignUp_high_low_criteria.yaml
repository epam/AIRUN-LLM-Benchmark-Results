evaluation_steps:
  accuracy:
  - Verify that Jest or another suitable testing framework is properly configured for React testing
  - Confirm that tests use proper mocking techniques for API calls rather than making real network requests
  - Validate that form validation logic tests cover both synchronous and asynchronous validation scenarios
  - Verify that test assertions properly check component rendering, state changes, and event handling
  - Confirm that test doubles or mocks are used for Redux store interactions
  - Ensure tests properly handle asynchronous operations with appropriate wait/async patterns
  - Verify that form submission handling tests check both success and error paths
  - Confirm tests verify proper rendering of form elements and error messages under different conditions
  - Validate that tests follow a consistent, readable structure with descriptive test names
  - Ensure tests achieve the specified 80% minimum code coverage across all files
  completeness:
  - Confirm presence of test files for all components requiring testing
  - Verify tests for form field validation covering name length restrictions (3-60 characters)
  - Ensure tests for email validation checking both format correctness and uniqueness
  - Validate tests for password validation with minimum length requirement (6 characters)
  - Confirm tests for form submission functionality including success and error handling
  - Verify tests for component rendering including proper display of UI elements and error messages
  - Ensure presence of tests for conditional rendering logic (such as validation feedback)
  - Verify tests cover all conditional branches and error handling paths
  - Confirm proper test setup and teardown procedures where appropriate
  - Validate presence of tests for component lifecycle methods
  - Ensure tests cover input field interactions and form state changes
  - Verify that test suite runs without errors or warnings
