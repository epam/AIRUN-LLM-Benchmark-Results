evaluation_steps:
  accuracy:
  - Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up with TypeScript support
  - Confirm that test configuration files (jest.config.js, setupTests.ts) are properly configured
  - Verify tests use proper isolation with no dependencies between test cases
  - Confirm mocks are implemented for external dependencies and browser APIs (localStorage)
  - Validate that component lifecycle methods are properly tested
  - Ensure tests verify both happy paths and edge cases/error conditions
  - Verify tests use proper describe/it blocks structure for readability
  - Confirm assertions include meaningful error messages
  - Validate that event handling tests correctly simulate user interactions
  - Verify tests achieve minimum 80% code coverage across all components
  - Ensure tests for UI components verify proper rendering based on props/state
  - Confirm tests for data management verify proper state updates
