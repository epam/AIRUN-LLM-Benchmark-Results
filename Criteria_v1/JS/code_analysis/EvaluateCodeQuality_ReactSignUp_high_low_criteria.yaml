evaluation_steps:
  accuracy:
    - Verify that all form inputs have associated labels for better accessibility.
    - Ensure that semantic HTML elements like `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<header>` are used to improve accessibility.
    - Check that ARIA attributes are used appropriately to enhance accessibility for screen readers.
    - Confirm that functional components with hooks are used instead of class components where possible.
    - Verify that the code follows React and Redux best practices, such as proper state management and component lifecycle methods.
    - Ensure that prop types are defined and documented using `PropTypes` or TypeScript interfaces.
    - Confirm adherence to React and JavaScript best practices, such as avoiding direct state mutations.
    - Check if the code is refactored to separate concerns and use dependency injection for better testability.
    - Verify that there are unit tests for the components using testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.
    - Ensure that the tests cover different scenarios and edge cases, including form validation and submission.
    - Verify that comments are added to explain the purpose of complex code blocks.
    - Check that the PropTypes are documented for better understanding of the expected props.
    - Ensure that the code has sufficient documentation, including function and component descriptions.
    - Confirm that the documentation is clear, concise, and follows a consistent format.
  completeness:
    - Check if the `PropTypes` import from `react` is updated to import from the `prop-types` package.
    - Verify that props are destructured in the `render` method to improve readability.
    - Confirm that the code uses clear and concise variable names.
    - Ensure that complex code blocks have explanatory comments for better understanding.
    - Check if functions are defined outside of the `render` method to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
    - Verify that validation logic is moved to a separate file to keep the component clean and maintainable.
    - Ensure that repetitive code is refactored into reusable functions or components.
    - Confirm that the code adheres to a consistent coding style and conventions.
    - Ensure that functions are bound in the constructor instead of inline in the `render` method to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
    - Verify that any potential performance bottlenecks, such as unnecessary re-renders or heavy computations in the render method, are optimized.
    - Check for the use of memoization techniques where applicable to improve performance.
