evaluation_steps:
  accuracy:
    - Confirm the validation rules, such as name length, valid email address, and minimum password length.
    - Verify the existence of API endpoints (`api.isName`, `api.isEmail`, `api.signup`) for validation and signup processes.
    - Check the use of `redux-form` for managing form state and validation.
    - Ensure the presence of UI components from `react-bootstrap` and custom components like `FormGroup` and `Icon`.
    - Confirm that asynchronous validation is performed in parallel using `Promise.all`.
    - Verify the efficient management of form state with `redux-form`.
    - Check if the code handles errors gracefully by providing user feedback.
    - Verify the use of reusable components like `FormGroup` and `Icon` to promote code maintainability.
    - Assess if the code demonstrates good practices in form state management and component reusability, beneficial for application scalability.
  completeness:
    - Verify that the code implements a signup form for a React application using Redux and `redux-form`.
    - Check for synchronous and asynchronous validation of form fields.
    - Confirm the presence of synchronous validation for name, email, and password fields.
    - Ensure that asynchronous validation checks if the name and email are already in use via API calls.
    - Ensure the form submission sends user data (name, email, password) to the backend API.
    - Verify that successful signup dispatches an action to update the application state.
    - Check that real-time feedback on form validation errors is provided.
    - Ensure success or error messages are displayed based on form submission results.
    - Confirm the presence of a link for existing users to navigate to the login page.
    - Determine if users can enter their name, email, and password into input fields.
    - Verify that real-time validation feedback is provided as users fill out the form.
    - Check if the form submission process includes displaying validation errors or success messages.
    - Assess if the code enables new users to create an account on the platform.
    - Check if user information (name, email, password) is collected for account creation.
    - Determine if the code encourages user engagement by highlighting platform benefits.
    - Verify that the code ensures data integrity by validating user inputs both synchronously
      and asynchronously.
    - Ensure it prevents duplicate accounts by checking for existing email or name.
