  completeness:
    - Verify that the test suite includes a test to render the component without crashing.
    - Confirm that the test suite includes a test to open the menu when the control is clicked.

    - Ensure that the test suite includes a test to display a "no options" message when there are no options available.
    - Verify that all tests are written using React Testing Library's render, screen, and fireEvent methods.
    - Ensure that all tests use the expect function from Jest to assert outcomes.
    - Verify that the test for rendering the component checks for the presence of the placeholder text.
    - Ensure that the test for opening the menu checks for the presence of the role listbox.
    - Confirm that the test for displaying options checks for the presence of option texts.
    - Ensure that the test for calling onChange verifies the correct arguments are passed to the callback.

    - Ensure that the test for clearing the selected option verifies the correct arguments are passed to the onChange callback.
    - Confirm that the test for filtering options verifies that only matching options are displayed.
    - Ensure that the test for displaying the loading message checks for the presence of the loading text.
    - Verify that the test for displaying the "no options" message checks for the presence of the no options text.
