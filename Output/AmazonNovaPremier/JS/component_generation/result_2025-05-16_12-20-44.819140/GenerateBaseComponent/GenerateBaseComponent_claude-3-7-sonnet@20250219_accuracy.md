# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x
  
  The component imports from React and makes use of modern React features and hooks consistent with React 18.x, including `useState`, `useRef`, `useEffect`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
  
  The code properly uses TypeScript with interface definitions for `Option` and `SearchableSelectProps`. Type annotations are used throughout, including for event handlers (`ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>`, `KeyboardEvent<HTMLDivElement>`, etc.) and the component itself is defined as `React.FC<SearchableSelectProps>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling
  
  The component imports './index.css' and the CSS file is provided with appropriate styles for the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments
  
  The code is clean, well-organized, and contains no TODO comments or placeholders.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility
  
  The component properly uses React's `useState` hook to manage state for `isOpen`, `searchTerm`, `selectedOption`, and `filteredOptions`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props
  
  The component accepts props for `options`, `placeholder` (with a default value), and `onChange` callback, making it customizable and reusable.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection
  
  The component implements keyboard event handlers with `handleKeyDown` for the component itself and inline handlers for list items, supporting Enter, Space, and Escape keys for interaction.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions
  
  The component correctly uses `useRef` to reference the select container and properly manages DOM listeners with `useEffect`, including cleanup of event listeners.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques
  
  The component includes `tabIndex` attributes and sets `autoFocus` on the search input when dropdown opens. However, it doesn't include complete keyboard navigation through the list items (arrow key navigation between options).

- **Pass** (90%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
  
  The component includes `role="option"` and `aria-selected` for list items, which is good. However, it could be improved with additional ARIA attributes like `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, and `aria-haspopup` on the main element.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  The code doesn't contain any obvious issues that would cause console errors or warnings.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component
  
  The component is structured to avoid unnecessary re-renders. State updates are isolated to the necessary variables, and the effect dependency array is properly specified.
