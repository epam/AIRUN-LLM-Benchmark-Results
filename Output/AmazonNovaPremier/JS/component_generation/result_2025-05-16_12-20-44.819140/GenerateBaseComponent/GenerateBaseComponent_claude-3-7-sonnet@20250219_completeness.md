# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown
- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown
- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys

    The provided code does not implement keyboard arrow key navigation for the dropdown options. While the component handles 'Enter', 'Space', and 'Escape' key presses, there is no code that handles the 'ArrowUp' and 'ArrowDown' keys to navigate through the list of options.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key

    The code includes an onKeyDown handler for list items that checks for the Enter key and calls handleSelect when pressed. However, there's a potential issue because focus management when navigating through the list isn't properly implemented, which could affect the ability to select items with Enter consistently.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused

    The handleKeyDown function checks for "Enter" and calls toggleDropdown().

- **Fail** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes

    There is no explicit code to manage focus when the dropdown closes. Ideally, the component should return focus to the select header when the dropdown closes, but there's no implementation for this behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click

    The handleSelect function sets isOpen to false when an item is selected, which will close the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard

    The handleSelect function is called when an Enter key is pressed on an option, and it sets isOpen to false.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed

    The handleKeyDown function checks for the "Escape" key and sets isOpen to false when detected.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component

    The component uses useEffect to add and remove an event listener for clicks outside the component, and the handleOutsideClick function sets isOpen to false when a click outside is detected.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused

    The handleKeyDown function checks for the "Enter" key and calls toggleDropdown(), which will open the dropdown if it's currently closed.
