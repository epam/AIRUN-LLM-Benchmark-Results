# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  Although the code does not explicitly state "React 18.x", it uses modern React features (e.g., hooks and functional components) consistent with React 18. It appears the component is developed with an up-to-date React version in mind.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  The code uses TypeScript syntax, with explicit type declarations for props, state, refs, and event handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  The component imports "./index.css" and the provided CSS is appropriate for styling the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  The code is clean, well-structured, and does not contain any extraneous or placeholder TODO comments.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  It makes effective use of useState for managing the dropdown visibility, search term, selected option, and filtered options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  The component accepts props (e.g., options, placeholder, onChange) which makes it flexible and reusable in different contexts.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  Keyboard navigation is supported via onKeyDown handlers for the main container and individual list items, handling keys such as Enter, Space, and Escape.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  useRef is used appropriately to detect clicks outside the component, and event listeners are added/removed correctly using useEffect.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  The component sets tabIndex on the main container and on interactive list items, and uses the autoFocus attribute on the search input, supporting proper focus management.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  ARIA attributes such as role="option" and aria-selected are applied to list items to enhance accessibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  A review of the code reveals no issues that typically trigger console warnings or errors.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  The component appears optimized in its state management and useEffect usage. However, without runtime profiling it is assumed that no unnecessary re-renders occur. (I am 90% confident in this evaluation because subtle performance issues might not be evident from a static code analysis.)
