# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component renders a container with the class "searchable-select" that includes a header and a conditionally rendered dropdown, effectively serving as a dropdown select UI element.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  Within the dropdown (rendered when isOpen is true), the component includes an input element with class "search-input" for searching options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The component uses a state variable (selectedOption) and updates it via the handleSelect function when an option is clicked or selected via Enter key, confirming that it supports single item selection.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The implementation does not provide keyboard arrow key navigation for moving between options. The key handling is limited to Enter, Space, and Escape keys. No logic exists to handle "ArrowUp" or "ArrowDown" events to navigate the options list.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  The onKeyDown handler on each list item listens for the Enter key to trigger selection via handleSelect, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  The componentâ€™s onKeyDown handler on the main container listens for the Enter key (or Space) to toggle the dropdown visibility.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  There is no explicit focus management to return focus to the main select component after the dropdown is closed. The code does not ensure that focus is programmatically set back after a selection is made or the dropdown is dismissed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  The handleSelect function closes the dropdown (by setting isOpen to false) when an item is selected via a mouse click.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  Selecting an option with the Enter key triggers handleSelect, which in turn closes the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  The handleKeyDown function listens for the Escape key to set isOpen to false, ensuring the dropdown closes when Escape is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  An event listener on the document detects clicks outside the component (via handleOutsideClick), closing the dropdown when a click is registered externally.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  When the select component is focused, pressing the Enter key toggles the dropdown open, as managed by the onKeyDown handler.
