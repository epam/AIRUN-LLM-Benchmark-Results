# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The code correctly fetches Star Wars characters from the SWAPI endpoint `https://swapi.dev/api/people` using Axios and displays them in an unordered list.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The CharacterList component implements a loading state with the line `if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;` which shows a loading indicator while data is being fetched.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The component maps through all characters in the response data and renders each one as a list item: `{characters.map((character, index) => (<li key={index}>{character.name}</li>))}`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  The solution does not implement any search functionality or user input fields, focusing only on displaying the list of characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character is displayed with its name property: `<li key={index}>{character.name}</li>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The solution begins with instructions to set up the project using Create React App with TypeScript: `npx create-react-app swapi-characters --template typescript`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The CharacterList component correctly implements state management for:
  - Loading state: `const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(true);`
  - Error state: `const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);`
  - Character data state: `const [characters, setCharacters] = useState<Character[]>([]);`

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each list item is given a key prop based on its index: `<li key={index}>{character.name}</li>`. While using the index as a key is not ideal in some scenarios, it's acceptable here since the character list from the API has a stable order and items are not being added/removed/reordered.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  If no characters are returned (empty array), the list would simply render empty, which is an appropriate handling. The error state will catch and display API failures, and the loading state handles the initial data fetch.
