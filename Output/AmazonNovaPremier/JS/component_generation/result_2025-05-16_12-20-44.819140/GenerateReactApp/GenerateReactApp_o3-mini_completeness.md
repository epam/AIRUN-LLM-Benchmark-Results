# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The code uses Axios to fetch data from "https://swapi.dev/api/people" and renders the list of characters in the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  While data is being fetched, the component returns a page with "Loading..." indicating that a loading state is present.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  The code maps over the fetched array and displays each character’s name in a list, thereby showing all characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  There is no implementation of search or user input fields in the provided code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each entry in the list is rendered with {character.name}, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The instructions include a command to create the project using Create React App with the TypeScript template, and the package.json reflects a standard CRA structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The component utilizes React’s useState hook to manage loading, error, and characters, and uses useEffect to fetch data.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  The code uses the array index as the key (key={index}). Although using indices can work for static lists, it is generally not considered optimal for dynamic data or when uniqueness can be derived from a property such as an id or URL. Using a unique identifier (like character.url) would have been a better practice.  
  (Confidence is 90% because while using indices is technically valid for static lists, the best practice is to use a unique value to ensure optimal rendering.)

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  The code does not include specific handling for cases where the characters array is empty (e.g., displaying a message such as "No characters available"). Rendering an empty UL without feedback might not inform the user about the empty state.
