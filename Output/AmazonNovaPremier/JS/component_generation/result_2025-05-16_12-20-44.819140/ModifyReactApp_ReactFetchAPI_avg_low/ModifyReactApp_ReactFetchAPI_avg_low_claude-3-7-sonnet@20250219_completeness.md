# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name
  
  The code clearly includes an input field with a search placeholder and onChange handler that updates the search query state and triggers the filtered search.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests
  
  The code includes a loading state that is toggled during API requests and displays a "Loading..." message when loading is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query
  
  The useEffect hook calls debouncedFetchCharacters('') when the component mounts, which triggers the initial data load with an empty search query.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type
  
  The handleSearch function updates the searchQuery state as users type and triggers the debouncedFetchCharacters function, which fetches data with the updated query.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found
  
  The component displays "No characters found" when filteredResults is empty.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design
  
  The search input has responsive styling with `width: '100%', maxWidth: '400px'`, which provides basic responsiveness. However, comprehensive responsive design might require additional media queries or responsive layout considerations for different screen sizes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response
  
  The component renders a list of characters from the filteredResults array after the API response is received.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed
  
  The code includes error handling in the API request with catch blocks, state for storing errors, and visual feedback for errors. However, it doesn't use React's Error Boundary component for component-level error handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props
  
  The code defines the Character interface for the API data and specifies type annotations for all state variables and function parameters.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities
  
  The code maintains the original functionality of displaying character data while adding search capabilities, with the search acting as a refinement of the displayed data.
