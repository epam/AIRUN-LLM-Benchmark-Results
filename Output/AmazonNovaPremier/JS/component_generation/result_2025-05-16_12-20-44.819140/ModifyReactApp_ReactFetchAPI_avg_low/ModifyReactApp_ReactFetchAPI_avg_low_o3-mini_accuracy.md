# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type  
  The input field includes an onChange handler (handleSearch) that updates the searchQuery state and calls the debounced API fetch.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls  
  The debounce function from lodash.debounce is used with a 300ms delay, which is within the expected range.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured  
  The code uses axios.get with the correctly constructed URL, making it clear that axios is being employed for API requests.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses  
  The component uses an interface for the Character type and applies TypeScript to React.FC, event handlers, and state management. While explicit return types for async functions are not added, the overall typing is appropriate.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters  
  The API URL template string includes `?search=${query}`, ensuring that the search query is properly appended.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate  
  useCallback is used for the fetchCharacters function, and useMemo is used for the debounced function and filteredResults, ensuring proper performance optimizations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback  
  Error handling is managed via a try-catch block that updates the error state and displays an error message to the user.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing  
  The integration of lodash.debounce ensures that the API call is made only 300ms after typing stops, preventing unnecessary rapid invocations.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices  
  The component leverages React's useState, useEffect, useCallback, and useMemo hooks effectively to manage state and side effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code  
  All imports are used, and there are no extraneous commented-out code blocks or apparent console errors in the provided snippet.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests  
  The loading state is set to true before initiating an API request and appropriately toggled off in the finally block after the request.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns  
  The component is written as a functional component using hooks, which aligns with React 18.x best practices.
