# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The code includes an input element with the placeholder "Search characters..." which is connected to a state (searchQuery) and used to filter the displayed characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  The loading state is managed and a "Loading..." message is rendered when the API call is in progress.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  The useEffect hook calls debouncedFetchCharacters('') on mount, ensuring initial data is loaded without any search filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  The handleSearch function updates the searchQuery state and calls debouncedFetchCharacters with the new query, and the results are filtered accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  If the filteredResults array is empty, the component renders a list item displaying "No characters found".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The input element is styled with a width of 100% and a maxWidth of 400px ensuring responsiveness across different device sizes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  The component maps over the filteredResults (which are updated after receiving the API response) and displays each character’s name.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  The code includes a try-catch block during the data fetch and sets an error state that is rendered when an error occurs. Although it does not use React’s Error Boundary component, the inline error handling fulfills the requirement for this context. The slight deduction is due to the absence of a dedicated React Error Boundary, but for API errors this approach is acceptable.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The code defines an interface (Character) and uses the React.FC type, properly typing the component and its data.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The code integrates the search functionality (with debouncing and filtering) without disrupting the original data fetching and display behavior.
