# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (85%): Ensure the documentation identifies all major components (REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, pageCtrl)

    The documentation identifies these components in the "Component Architecture" section, mentioning "Factories: REST (API communication), Page (global state), Users (current user data)" and "Controller: pageCtrl manages page operations and data binding". However, I'm not 100% confident as the documentation doesn't provide exhaustive details about each component's implementation.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the documentation explains the purpose of the REST factory for API communication

    The documentation clearly states that the REST factory is for "API communication" in the Component Architecture section and further elaborates on REST patterns in the "RESTful API Patterns" section.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm the documentation describes all API endpoints exposed in the REST factory

    While the documentation mentions "/api/content, /api/revisions" as resource-based endpoints in the RESTful API Patterns section, it doesn't provide a comprehensive list of all API endpoints exposed in the REST factory. It mentions general CRUD operations but lacks specific details about each endpoint's parameters, return values, and error handling.

- **Pass** (80%): Validate the documentation explains the Page factory and its role in storing global page variables

    The documentation states that the Page factory handles "global state" in the Component Architecture section, but it doesn't provide detailed explanation of how the global page variables are stored and managed.

- **Pass** (75%): Ensure the documentation describes the Users factory and its purpose for user data management

    The documentation mentions the Users factory for "current user data" in the Component Architecture section and references it again under Authentication Model, but lacks specific details about its implementation and methods.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify the documentation explains the page controller's responsibilities and features

    The documentation states that "pageCtrl manages page operations and data binding" in the Component Architecture section and indirectly describes its responsibilities throughout sections like User Interaction Patterns and Workflow.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm the documentation describes the local storage mechanism for unsaved changes

    The documentation clearly mentions "Local Storage: Auto-save drafts and detect unsaved changes" in Main Functionality and Features, and repeats this information in multiple sections, including "LocalStorage for drafts" under Technical Constraints and Data Management.

- **Fail** (95%): Validate the documentation explains the version comparison functionality

    While the documentation mentions "Version Control: Track revisions and restore previous versions" in Main Functionality, it doesn't specifically explain how version comparison works. Under Workflow, it mentions "Manage revisions → Compare/Revert" but doesn't detail the comparison functionality.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the documentation describes the page creation workflow

    The documentation describes this under the Workflow section: "Create/edit page → Fill form → Save/Publish" which covers the basic page creation workflow.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the documentation explains the page editing workflow

    Similar to page creation, the workflow "Create/edit page → Fill form → Save/Publish" is mentioned, and additional details about detecting unsaved changes are included.

- **Pass** (85%): Confirm the documentation describes the page duplication feature

    The documentation mentions "duplicate pages" in the Main Functionality and Features section, though it doesn't go into detail about how the duplication process works.

- **Pass** (85%): Validate the documentation explains the page deletion process

    The documentation mentions "delete" pages in the Main Functionality and Features section and includes "Delete: Pages and associated data" under CRUD Operations, though specific details about the deletion process are limited.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the auto-URL generation from title feature

    This is clearly described in multiple places, including "URL auto-generation" under Validation and "Auto-generated URLs from titles" under Business Rules.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify the documentation explains tag management and autocompletion

    The documentation mentions "Autocomplete tag suggestions" under UI Components and "Tag autocomplete validation" under Validation, as well as "String-based tag system" under Data Assumptions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the publication status options (publish, draft, schedule)

    The documentation clearly mentions "Publish status toggles (draft/publish/schedule)" under UI Components.

- **Pass** (95%): Validate the documentation explains scheduled content publishing

    The documentation includes "Scheduled publishing" under Core Functionality, mentions schedule as a publish status option, and notes "Scheduled dates can't be backdated" under Business Rules.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the documentation describes page revision management

    The documentation mentions "Version Control: Track revisions and restore previous versions" in Main Functionality and "Revision management buttons" under UI Components, as well as "Manage revisions → Compare/Revert" in the Workflow section.

- **Pass** (85%): Verify the documentation explains the handling of page extras and additional data

    The documentation mentions "Nested resources for revisions and extras" under RESTful API Patterns, though the details about handling extras are limited.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm the documentation describes form validation mechanisms

    The documentation mentions "Validation" with specific points like "Required fields (ng-required)", "URL auto-generation", "Duplicate URL detection", and "Tag autocomplete validation".

- **Fail** (80%): Validate the documentation explains error handling during API operations

    While the documentation mentions "Standardized error handling" under API Patterns, it doesn't provide specific details about how errors are handled during API operations. There's no explanation of error types, error response formats, or how errors are presented to users.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure the documentation describes notification messaging for user feedback

    The documentation doesn't specifically mention notification messaging for user feedback. While it discusses validation and detecting unsaved changes, it doesn't explain how users are notified of these events.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify the documentation explains the theme-specific page types feature

    The documentation mentions "Mandatory page type selection" under Business Rules, which implies theme-specific page types, though detailed explanation is limited.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the featured image handling

    The documentation does not mention featured image handling anywhere in the analysis.

- **Pass** (95%): Validate the documentation explains URL validation and error handling

    The documentation mentions "URL validation" in several places, including "Duplicate URL detection" under Validation and "Unique URLs required" under Business Rules.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the documentation describes the tag suggestion system based on user input

    The documentation mentions "Autocomplete tag suggestions" under UI Components and "Tag autocomplete validation" under Validation, which implies a tag suggestion system based on user input.
