# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation identifies all major components (REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, pageCtrl)  
  The answer clearly lists the factories (REST, Page, Users) and the controller (pageCtrl).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the purpose of the REST factory for API communication  
  The REST factory is directly indicated as handling API communication.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the documentation describes all API endpoints exposed in the REST factory  
  The answer mentions resource-based endpoints (/api/content, /api/revisions) and standard CRUD operations. Although it does not list every endpoint explicitly, it sufficiently covers the main API endpoints.  
  (Slight uncertainty due to the absence of a full endpoint list.)

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains the Page factory and its role in storing global page variables  
  The answer refers to the Page factory as handling global state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the Users factory and its purpose for user data management  
  The Users factory is mentioned as managing current user data.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page controller's responsibilities and features  
  The answer states that pageCtrl manages page operations and data binding.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the local storage mechanism for unsaved changes  
  Local Storage is mentioned both in the main functionality and in data management for drafts and unsaved changes.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate the documentation explains the version comparison functionality  
  The answer discusses version control with "Track revisions and restore previous versions" and "Compare/Revert" in the workflow. However, the details on the actual comparison process are minimal.  
  (This results in a slight drop in confidence.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the page creation workflow  
  The workflow clearly mentions "Create/edit page → Fill form → Save/Publish".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page editing workflow  
  Page editing is covered within the same workflow as page creation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the page duplication feature  
  The duplication feature is explicitly mentioned under main functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains the page deletion process  
  The answer lists deletion as a core action and mentions “Delete pages and associated data”.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the auto-URL generation from title feature  
  The documentation covers auto-generation of URLs, both in validation and business rules.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains tag management and autocompletion  
  Tag management is evident from the UI components and validations mentioned (autocomplete tag suggestions).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the publication status options (publish, draft, schedule)  
  Publication status toggles are clearly stated among the UI components.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains scheduled content publishing  
  Scheduled publishing is mentioned as part of business requirements and in the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes page revision management  
  Revision tracking, comparison, and revert functionalities are described in multiple sections.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the documentation explains the handling of page extras and additional data  
  The answer mentions "Nested resources for revisions and extras," indicating handling of additional data. However, the explanation is brief.  
  (Minor detail is lacking.)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes form validation mechanisms  
  The answer references real-time validation, required fields (ng-required), and other validation rules.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains error handling during API operations  
  It is noted that there is standardized error handling during API operations in the API Patterns section.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes notification messaging for user feedback  
  There is no mention of notification messaging in the provided documentation.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the theme-specific page types feature  
  The documentation does not mention any theme-specific page types.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the featured image handling  
  There is no reference to the handling of featured images.

- **Fail** (90%): Validate the documentation explains URL validation and error handling  
  While the answer discusses duplicate URL detection and auto-generation, it does not elaborate on comprehensive URL validation and error handling.  
  (The slight uncertainty is due to the indirect coverage via duplicate detection.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the tag suggestion system based on user input  
  The answer mentions autocomplete tag suggestions, which fulfills this requirement.
