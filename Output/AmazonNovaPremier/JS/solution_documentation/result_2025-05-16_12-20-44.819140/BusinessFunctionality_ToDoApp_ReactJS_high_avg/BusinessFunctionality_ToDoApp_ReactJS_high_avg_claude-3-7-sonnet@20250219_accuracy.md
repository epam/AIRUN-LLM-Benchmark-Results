- **Fail** (90%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of the Utils class for helper functions

    The document does not explicitly mention a Utils class or utility functions. While the document describes most aspects of the application architecture in detail, it does not specifically reference any Utils class that might contain helper functions. This could be an omission if such a class exists in the actual implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the data flow between components
