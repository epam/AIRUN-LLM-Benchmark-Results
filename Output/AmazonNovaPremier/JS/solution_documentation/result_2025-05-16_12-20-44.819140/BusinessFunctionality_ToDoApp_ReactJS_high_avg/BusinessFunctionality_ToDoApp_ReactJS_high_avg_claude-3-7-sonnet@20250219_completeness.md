    While the document comprehensively covers most aspects of the todo application, I could not find a specific mention of the pluralization feature for item/items text based on count. The document mentions "TodoFooter: Displays todo statistics and filter controls" and references statistics, but does not explicitly state that the text changes between singular "item" and plural "items" based on the count of remaining todos. This is a small UI detail but was specifically mentioned in the evaluation criteria.
