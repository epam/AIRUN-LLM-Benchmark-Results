# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers all main functionality including adding, editing, deleting, and toggling todos  
  The answer clearly lists Todo Management features with create, edit, delete, and toggle completion actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about filtering todos by status (all, active, completed)  
  The document explicitly mentions Filtering to view all, active, or completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the user workflow for creating new todo items  
  The Workflow section states that the user adds todos through the main input, which is sufficient to describe the creation process.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the editing functionality triggered by double-clicking  
  It clearly lists that editing is initiated via a double-click on the todo text in the User Interaction Patterns section.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the clear completed functionality  
  The answer describes "clear completed todos" in both the Main Functionality and Features and the Workflow sections.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the toggle all functionality  
  The functionality to toggle all todos as complete/incomplete is explicitly mentioned.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the document covers the counter for remaining items  
  The document mentions that TodoFooter displays todo statistics, which generally includes a counter for remaining items. However, it does not explicitly explain the pluralization or numeric detail, so although the basic concept is covered, the explicit mechanism (e.g., "1 item left" vs. "2 items left") is not described.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the persistent storage of todos  
  Persistence is clearly explained with the use of localStorage to store todos between sessions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the UI components and their relationships  
  The answer provides an in-depth breakdown of each component (TodoApp, TodoModel, TodoItem, TodoFooter) and their relationships and responsibilities.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the business objectives addressed by the application  
  The Business Objectives section is detailed, listing the primary and secondary objectives of the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes performance and scalability considerations  
  Performance and scalability are addressed with points on optimizations, immutable data patterns, and potential scalability issues with localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes technical constraints and limitations  
  The Constraints and Assumptions section clearly outlines technical constraints (client-side only, localStorage dependency, etc.) along with efficiency concerns.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the document covers the pluralization of item/items text based on count  
  The document does not explicitly discuss how pluralization (e.g., "item" vs. "items") is handled in the statistics display, which is a common detail in todo applications for user clarity.
