# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props

    While TypeScript is used throughout the code, some types could be more specific. For example, in PageService.ts, the savePage function uses `any` for the page parameter. Additionally, RootState type is referenced but not fully defined in the provided code. The implementation shows general TypeScript usage but lacks complete strict typing in some areas.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management

    The implementation clearly uses Redux Toolkit with createSlice for state management. This is evident in the pageSlice.ts file where createSlice is imported and used to define reducers and actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components

    All components in the implementation are functional components utilizing React hooks, not class components.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately

    The implementation uses useState and demonstrates knowledge of useEffect. The PageForm component properly uses useState for localVersion state. However, useCallback and useMemo are not demonstrated in the provided code, which could potentially be beneficial for performance optimization in more complex scenarios.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource

    The implementation uses axios for API communication as shown in the PageService.ts file.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components

    The form in PageForm.tsx uses controlled components with value and onChange handlers connected to Redux state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation

    React Router is properly implemented in App.tsx using BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization

    The implementation properly uses react-i18next for internationalization, as shown in the App.tsx and PageForm.tsx files.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization

    Code splitting is implemented using React.lazy and Suspense for the PageEditor component in App.tsx.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations

    There is no evidence of React.memo being used for component memoization anywhere in the provided code.

- **Pass** (70%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks

    While useEffect is imported in PageForm.tsx, there's no actual implementation with dependency arrays shown in the provided code, making it difficult to fully evaluate this requirement. The code structure suggests awareness of hook dependencies, but doesn't demonstrate implementation.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models

    The code references TypeScript interfaces for data models like Page and PageState, but not all interfaces are fully defined in the snippets provided (e.g., User interface is mentioned in the directory structure but not shown).

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state

    Redux selectors are properly implemented and used, as seen with selectCurrentPage in pageSlice.ts and its usage in PageForm.tsx.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations

    The code correctly implements action creators through Redux Toolkit's createSlice, with the updateField action creator properly defined and used.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks

    There is no implementation of local storage functionality in the provided code. Neither direct localStorage calls nor custom hooks for storage are present.
