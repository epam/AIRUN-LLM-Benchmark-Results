# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented

    The implementation only shows the update functionality through the `savePage` function in the PageService.ts. There is no implementation for create, delete, or duplicate functionality. The code only shows a `savePage` function that makes a POST request to '/api/content', but lacks the implementations for other CRUD operations.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present

    There is no implementation of page type selection functionality in the provided code. The PageForm component does not include any UI elements or state management for selecting different page types.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists

    The code doesn't show any implementation of URL auto-generation from the title. There should be a function that listens to title changes and automatically generates a URL slug, but this functionality is absent in the provided implementation.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented

    While the state includes a `suggestions` array in the pageSlice, there is no implementation of tag management with autocomplete in the UI components. The PageForm component doesn't show any tag input fields or autocomplete functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available

    The code doesn't implement publish status options. There are no UI controls for selecting between publish, draft, or schedule statuses in the PageForm component.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented

    There is no implementation of scheduled publishing date functionality. No date picker or date handling code is visible in the provided implementation.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present

    The code includes a basic implementation of local version comparison through the `localVersion` state in the PageForm component, along with a warning message and a discard button. However, the actual logic for comparing versions and restoring from local storage is not fully implemented. The state is initialized but there's no code showing how it's updated based on storage comparison.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented

    While there is a placeholder comment for "Show success notification" in the handleSave function, there is no actual implementation of a notification system. The Notification.tsx component is mentioned in the directory structure but its implementation is not provided, and it's not used in the PageForm component.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present

    The implementation doesn't include any form validation logic. There are no checks for required fields like URL or page type, and no error messages displayed for invalid input.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled

    The implementation only shows a single API endpoint ('/api/content') for saving pages. It doesn't demonstrate proper handling of all the API endpoints that would exist in the original AngularJS application.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented

    There is no implementation of extras management functionality in the provided code. The PageForm component doesn't include any UI elements or state management for extras.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained

    The code doesn't implement any revision history functionality. There's no UI or logic related to viewing or managing revisions of pages.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components

    The code is well-organized into feature folders, with separation of business logic from UI components. It follows a clean architecture with Redux slices separated from React components, and services kept distinct from both.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved

    The code includes proper setup for i18next and uses the `useTranslation` hook to translate UI elements. The translation setup appears complete, but without seeing all UI components, it's not possible to verify that all required strings are translated.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters

    While the code sets up a basic route structure with a `/:url` parameter, there's no evidence that it maintains all the URL structures and parameters from the original application. The route configuration is minimal and doesn't show how various features are accessed through URLs.
