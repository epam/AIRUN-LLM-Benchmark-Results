# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props  
  Although the majority of the project is written in TypeScript and interfaces (such as Page and User) are defined, there are parts where strict typing is not enforced. For example, in the API service (PageService.ts), the function parameter is typed as any rather than a specific type. This weakens the overall strict typing standard.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management  
  The implementation correctly uses Redux Toolkitâ€™s createSlice (see pageSlice.ts) for managing state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components  
  Every component in the provided code (e.g., App.tsx, PageForm.tsx, Layout.tsx) is written as a functional component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately  
  The answer makes use of hooks like useState, useEffect, and useTranslation appropriately. Although useCallback or useMemo are not explicitly required in the given context, the hooks in use are correctly leveraged.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource  
  The API communication is implemented using axios in PageService.ts.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components  
  In the PageForm component, an input is controlled by explicitly setting its value and handling onChange events via dispatching Redux actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation  
  The implementation correctly uses BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route from react-router-dom to handle navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization  
  The answer incorporates react-i18next for internationalization.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization  
  The implementation uses React.lazy along with Suspense to lazy-load components, which demonstrates code splitting.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations  
  There is no usage of React.memo in the provided code. Although the current implementation might not yet require memoization, this evaluation step specifically asks for its use in expensive render operations.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks  
  The code imports useEffect in PageForm.tsx but does not show any use of useEffect with a dependency array. Without any demonstrable proper usage, this evaluation step is not met.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models  
  TypeScript interfaces exist (e.g., the Page interface in types/Page.ts) to describe the data models.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state  
  A Redux selector, selectCurrentPage, is defined and utilized in PageForm to access the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations  
  The updateField action is defined within pageSlice and correctly dispatched to handle state mutations.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks  
  No localStorage functionality or hooks related to local storage are present in the provided implementation.
