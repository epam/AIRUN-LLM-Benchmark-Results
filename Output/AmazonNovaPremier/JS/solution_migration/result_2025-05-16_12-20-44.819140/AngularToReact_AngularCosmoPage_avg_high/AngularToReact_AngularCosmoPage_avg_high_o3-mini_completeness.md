# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
  The provided implementation only shows an update function (updateField) in the page slice. There is no evidence in the code of create, delete, or duplicate functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
  There is no functionality or UI component in the code that allows selecting or switching page types.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
  The answer lacks any logic or mechanism (e.g., effects or util functions) that auto-generate the URL based on the title.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
  There is no implementation regarding tag management or autocomplete suggestions for tags in the given code.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
  No components or state management logic is shown that provides different publish statuses like publish, draft, or schedule.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
  The solution does not include any feature or UI for selecting or managing scheduled publishing dates.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
  Although there is a state variable (localVersion) and a UI prompt for version warning, there is no detailed implementation showing version comparison or restoration functionalities. The evaluation is done with slight reservation that some minimal approach might have been intended but not fully realized.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
  The code contains only placeholder comments for success and error notifications without any actual implementation.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
  No form validation logic is implemented; required fields such as URL or page type are not validated in the code.

- **Fail** (85%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
  Only one API endpoint (savePage) is present. The original application might have more endpoints (for deletion, duplication, etc.) that are not handled in the provided code. (Confidence slightly reduced due to uncertainty of the original full scope.)

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
  There is no evidence of any extras management functionality in the code.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
  The answer does not include any implementation for revision history or version tracking of the content changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
  The provided project structure clearly separates concerns into folders such as app, features, components, i18n, and types.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
  The implementation integrates react-i18next and provides a basic setup for translations, ensuring that i18n functionality is maintained.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
  The application uses React Router v6 with a route defined as "/:url", which appears to maintain the URL structure similar to the original AngularJS application. However, the simplicity of the routing setup leaves a small margin for uncertainty regarding more complex URL parameters.
