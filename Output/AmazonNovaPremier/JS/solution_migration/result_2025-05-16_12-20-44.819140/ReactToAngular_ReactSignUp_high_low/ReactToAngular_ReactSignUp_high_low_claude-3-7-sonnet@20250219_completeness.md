# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component includes all three required form fields: name, email, and password
  
  The component clearly includes all three required form fields in the FormGroup initialization:
  ```typescript
  this.form = this.fb.group({
    name: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3), Validators.maxLength(60)], [this.validateName.bind(this)]],
    email: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.email], [this.validateEmail.bind(this)]],
    password: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.minLength(6)]]
  });
  ```
  These fields are also properly displayed in the HTML template with appropriate form controls.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page includes a heading 'Join PodBaby today.'
  
  The heading is present in the HTML template:
  ```html
  <h2>Join PodBaby today.</h2>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a lead paragraph about membership benefits
  
  The paragraph with the "lead" class is present with text about membership benefits:
  ```html
  <p class="lead">
    As a member you can subscribe to podcast feeds and track episodes.
  </p>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form includes a submit button with appropriate styling and icon
  
  The submit button is present with Bootstrap's btn-primary class and an icon:
  ```html
  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary" [disabled]="submitting || form.invalid">
    <i class="fa fa-sign-in"></i> Signup
  </button>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a link to the login page with appropriate text
  
  The link to the login page is present with appropriate text:
  ```html
  <p><a routerLink="/login">Already a member? Login</a></p>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the FormGroup component or equivalent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display
  
  While the main form doesn't use the FormGroupComponent directly, it implements equivalent functionality with form validation, error messages, and proper styling. The FormGroupComponent is correctly implemented and could be used in other parts of the application.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the Icon component or equivalent is implemented for the signup button
  
  The code uses FontAwesome icon directly with `<i class="fa fa-sign-in"></i>` rather than an Icon component. There is no evidence of an Icon component implementation in the provided code.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all validation rules are implemented (name length, email format, password length)
  
  All specified validation rules are implemented:
  - Name: required, minLength(3), maxLength(60)
  - Email: required, email format validator
  - Password: required, minLength(6)
  
  These are properly displayed in the HTML with corresponding error messages.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure asynchronous validation for both name and email uniqueness is implemented
  
  Asynchronous validation for both name and email uniqueness is implemented through:
  ```typescript
  validateName(control: FormControl)
  validateEmail(control: FormControl)
  ```
  Both methods correctly use the API service to check if the name or email is already taken.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API integration is complete with proper error handling
  
  The signup API integration is implemented in the submit method with proper error handling using RxJS operators:
  ```typescript
  this.api.signup(name, email, password).pipe(
    map(result => {
      this.store.dispatch(authActions.signupComplete({ data: result.data }));
      this.submitting = false;
    }),
    catchError(error => {
      this.submitting = false;
      return of(error);
    })
  ).subscribe();
  ```

- **Fail** (95%): Confirm the form layout matches the horizontal form structure specified
  
  The form doesn't appear to use a horizontal layout structure. Typically, horizontal forms in Bootstrap have labels to the left of the inputs, using classes like "form-horizontal" and "col-" classes. The form in the provided code appears to be a standard vertical form without these horizontal layout elements.

  I'm 95% confident because while the form is clearly not using Bootstrap's horizontal form structure, there's a small possibility that a custom horizontal layout is implemented elsewhere in CSS not shown here.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page has proper document title setting functionality
  
  While the code imports a `getTitle` function from './utils', it is never used in the component. There is no implementation for setting the document title.
