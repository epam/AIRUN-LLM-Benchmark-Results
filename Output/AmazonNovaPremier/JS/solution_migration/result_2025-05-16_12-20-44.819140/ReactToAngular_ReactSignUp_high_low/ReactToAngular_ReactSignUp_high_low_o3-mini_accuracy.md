# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The code imports FormBuilder, FormGroup, and Validators and builds the form using fb.group.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The form controls include Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3) and Validators.maxLength(60) for name, Validators.email for email, and Validators.minLength(6) for password.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  Asynchronous validators are provided by passing an array of validators to the controls. The validateName and validateEmail functions use observables (switchMap with API calls) to ascertain if the name or email is taken.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The template uses ngClass to apply the 'has-error' class when form controls are invalid and have been touched. Additionally, error messages are conditionally displayed for each field.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  In the submit() method, the API service is called and on success, it dispatches authActions.signupComplete with the returned data.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The template provides inline messaging for each field using *ngIf to conditionally display error messages (e.g., "Name required", "Min 3 chars", etc.). The form-group component also renders error details.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  Although the utils file provides a getTitle function, the component does not utilize Angular’s Title service to set the page title. There is no code present that sets the title via Angular’s Title API.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The component injects both Store and Actions from '@ngrx/store' and '@ngrx/effects'. It dispatches an action on successful API call.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button is disabled when either the form is invalid or the 'submitting' flag is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  The API call in submit() uses RxJS operators with a catchError block, ensuring that both success and error responses are handled.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component is structured well, using Angular’s dependency injection, reactive forms, and encapsulated components. However, the lack of explicit unsubscription management from the subscription (in the submit() method) could be a minor concern; in this context, it is acceptable since it is a one-off observable. This gives a slight reservation, hence a 90% confidence level.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The ApiService makes use of Angular’s HttpClient to perform HTTP requests.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The displayed error messages (e.g., "Name required", "Min 3 chars", "Email required", etc.) match the expected validations defined by the requirements.
