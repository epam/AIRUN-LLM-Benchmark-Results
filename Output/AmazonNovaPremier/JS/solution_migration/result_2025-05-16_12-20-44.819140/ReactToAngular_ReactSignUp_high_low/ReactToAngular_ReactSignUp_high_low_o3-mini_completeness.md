# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component includes all three required form fields: name, email, and password  
  The component’s form declaration includes controls for "name", "email", and "password".

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page includes a heading 'Join PodBaby today.'  
  The HTML contains an <h2> element with the text "Join PodBaby today."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a lead paragraph about membership benefits  
  The page contains a <p class="lead"> element explaining the benefits of membership.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form includes a submit button with appropriate styling and icon  
  A submit button is present with the class "btn btn-primary" and integrates an icon via <i class="fa fa-sign-in"></i>.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a link to the login page with appropriate text  
  There is an anchor element with routerLink="/login" and the text "Already a member? Login."

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the FormGroup component or equivalent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display  
  A dedicated FormGroupComponent is provided, which wraps form controls and displays errors appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Icon component or equivalent is implemented for the signup button  
  Although no separate Icon component is created, the use of the <i> element with appropriate FontAwesome classes serves as an equivalent solution.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all validation rules are implemented (name length, email format, password length)  
  Validators are applied as follows:  
  • Name: required, minlength(3), maxlength(60)  
  • Email: required, email  
  • Password: required, minlength(6)  
  All expected validations are in place.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure asynchronous validation for both name and email uniqueness is implemented  
  The component implements async validators for both "name" and "email" using the ApiService methods (isName and isEmail), which return observables that trigger on value changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API integration is complete with proper error handling  
  The signup method calls the API (this.api.signup) and dispatches a store action on success. Errors are caught using catchError, and the submitting flag is appropriately reset.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the form layout matches the horizontal form structure specified  
  The provided markup appears to use a vertical stacking of form fields rather than a horizontal layout. There is no indication (such as a grid system or specific layout classes) that a horizontal layout is implemented.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page has proper document title setting functionality  
  The code does not include any mechanism (e.g., using Angular’s Title service) to set or update the document title dynamically.
