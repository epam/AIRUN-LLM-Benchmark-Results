# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The implementation shows clear use of Angular framework with standard commands like `ng new`, and using Angular-specific decorators such as `@Component`, `@Input`, `@Output`, and `@ViewChild`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
  
  The implementation includes NgRx store setup with appropriate installation commands: `ng add @ngrx/store@latest` and properly implements store with reducers in `src/app/store/todo.reducer.ts`.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
  
  While @ngrx/effects is installed with `ng add @ngrx/effects@latest`, there is no implementation of effects in the code. No effect classes or effect registrations are present.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
  
  Actions are properly defined using `createAction` in `todo.actions.ts`. The reducer is implemented correctly with `createReducer` and handling all the defined actions. Although explicit selectors aren't shown, store selection is used in the app component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
  
  Components are correctly decorated with `@Component` and use `@Input`, `@Output`, and `@ViewChild` appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators
  
  The implementation correctly uses `@ViewChild('editField')` in the TodoItemComponent to replace React refs.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
  
  The implementation shows proper use of `@Input()` for property binding and `@Output() EventEmitter` for event handling in components like TodoItemComponent.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
  
  There are no Angular services defined in the provided implementation. Business logic appears to be handled directly in components and NgRx.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
  
  Dependency injection is used correctly in the AppComponent where Store is injected through the constructor: `constructor(private store: Store) {}`.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
  
  There is no explicit use of change detection strategies (like `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`) in any of the components.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
  
  While the Angular project is created with routing (`ng new angular-todo-app --routing`), there is no implementation of routes or router integration shown in the code.

- **Fail** (80%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  While many aspects like component structure and module organization follow conventions, without seeing the full codebase including CSS/SCSS and HTML templates, I cannot fully confirm compliance with all Angular style guide conventions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
  
  TypeScript interfaces are properly defined (e.g., Todo interface) and used consistently throughout the application.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
  
  The implementation mentions "Update `src/app/app.component.html` and other component templates accordingly" but doesn't actually provide the HTML templates, so we can't verify they've been properly converted from JSX.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
  
  React event handlers are properly replaced with Angular event bindings (e.g., `handleKeyDown`, `handleSubmit`, etc.).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs
  
  The provided code does not contain any TODO comments or unfinished implementations.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules
  
  There is no implementation of lazy loading for feature modules in the provided code. No feature modules are even defined.
