# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items

    The provided code does not include the HTML template for the app component or other components that would display the todo items. While the code includes state management and component logic, without the corresponding HTML templates we cannot verify that the todo items are being displayed correctly.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented

    While the `handleNewTodoKeyDown` method is implemented in the AppComponent and the action creator for adding todos exists, the implementation is incomplete. The `Action` type is referenced but not imported in the reducer file, which would cause compilation errors. Additionally, the `uuidv4` function is imported but not properly used in the store code.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works

    The toggle functionality is defined in the actions and reducer, but the complete implementation in the component templates is missing. We can't verify the toggle functionality works without seeing how it's wired up in the templates.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented

    The TodoItemComponent includes editing logic, but there's a reference to `ESCAPE_KEY` and `ENTER_KEY` constants that aren't imported in the component file. Additionally, without the template, we can't verify the editing UI implementation.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented

    The action and reducer for destroying todos are defined, but the complete implementation across components cannot be verified without the templates.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented

    While the actions and reducer include the toggleAllTodos action, there's no UI implementation visible in the provided code to trigger this action.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works

    The constants for the filter states are defined, but there's no implementation for the filtering logic or UI in the provided code.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items

    The TodoFooterComponent includes count and completedCount as inputs, but there's no template provided to verify how these counts are displayed. Additionally, there's a reference to a Utils.pluralize function that isn't provided in the code.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items

    While the clearCompleted action is defined and the action is dispatched in the AppComponent, there's no template showing the button implementation.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage

    There is no implementation for local storage persistence in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation

    There's no routing implementation visible in the provided code to verify URL structure maintenance.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states

    There's no code provided that handles empty states for the todo list.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly

    The code includes event handlers for key presses, but without the complete templates and form implementations, we can't verify form submission handling.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships

    While some component relationships are defined through inputs and outputs, the overall structure is incomplete without module declarations and component hierarchies in templates.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved

    Without seeing the original application or a complete implementation of the Angular version, we cannot verify that all business logic is preserved.
