# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The answer states that the migration is to Angular 14.x and uses the Angular CLI (`ng new`) to set up the project. However, the version isn’t explicitly enforced in the code, so there is slight uncertainty.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The application explicitly installs and utilizes @ngrx/store, as evidenced by the usage in both the project setup and the store integration in the app module.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  While the setup command includes `ng add @ngrx/effects`, there is no accompanying code (such as effects implementations or createEffect usage) that demonstrates the handling of side effects.

- **Fail** (85%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  The code provides clear actions and reducers. However, selectors are not explicitly defined (using a separate selectors file or functions) but are instead handled inline in the component. This omission causes a failure in meeting the complete requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  All components (for example, TodoItemComponent, TodoFooterComponent, AppComponent) are correctly decorated with @Component, and they utilize @Input and @Output where needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  The `TodoItemComponent` uses @ViewChild to reference an element, appropriately replacing the use of React refs.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  The components leverage @Input and @Output effectively for passing data and emitting events, confirming proper communication between parent and child components.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  The implementation handles state and logic directly within components and NgRx store files, without using dedicated Angular services for encapsulating data handling or business logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  The application properly injects dependencies (e.g., the Store is injected in the AppComponent) via constructor injection.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  There is no sign of explicit use of Angular’s change detection strategies (such as OnPush) in the provided components.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  Although the Angular project is created with routing enabled (via the `--routing` flag), the provided code does not demonstrate any use of the Angular Router for actual navigation.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The project structure, naming conventions, and file organization are consistent with many Angular style guide recommendations.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  The code defines and uses TypeScript interfaces (e.g., the Todo interface) effectively, ensuring type safety across the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  The answer instructs the conversion of JSX to Angular’s HTML templates and provides Angular component-based templates, confirming that the migration is complete.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  Event handling is fully adapted to Angular’s style, for example, handling keydown events in the Angular way rather than using React’s event system.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  No TODO comments or placeholder code markers are present in the supplied implementation.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  The application structure displayed in the answer does not indicate any use of lazy loading for feature modules; all components and modules are eagerly loaded within the main application module.
