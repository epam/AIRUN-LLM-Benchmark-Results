# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass** (90%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
   Although the provided code does not show the complete HTML templates for listing todos, the AppComponent subscribes to the todo list from the store and the TodoItemComponent is implemented. This suggests that the display functionality is intended. However, since the actual template code is not fully shown, there is a slight uncertainty.

2. **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
   The AppComponent includes a handleNewTodoKeyDown function that dispatches an action to add a new todo when the Enter key is pressed, indicating that this functionality is implemented.

3. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
   The reducer implements the toggleTodo action and the TodoItemComponent provides an output for toggling. This confirms that toggling functionality is present.

4. **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
   The TodoItemComponent includes methods to handle editing (handleEdit, handleSubmit, etc.) and a corresponding updateTodo action is present in the reducer, showing that editing is supported.

5. **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
   There is a destroy event in TodoItemComponent, and the reducer handles the destroyTodo action, confirming deletion functionality.

6. **Pass** (80%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
   The NgRx store includes the toggleAllTodos action and the reducer updates all todos accordingly. However, no explicit UI element is shown in the components to trigger this action, leading to a slight uncertainty regarding its full integration.

7. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
   While constants for ALL_TODOS, ACTIVE_TODOS, and COMPLETED_TODOS are defined and the AppComponent has a nowShowing property, there is no implementation of actual filtering logic. The code does not demonstrate filtering the displayed todos based on these values.

8. **Pass** (80%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
   The TodoFooterComponent accepts inputs for count and completedCount and uses a pluralize utility. Although the integration of these counts with the current state is implied, the actual computation and display in the HTML templates are not fully shown, resulting in some uncertainty.

9. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
   Both the TodoFooterComponent and AppComponent include mechanisms (via an emitted event and the clearCompletedTodos action) to clear completed todos, indicating that this functionality is implemented.

10. **Fail** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
    There is no implementation provided for persisting todo items to local storage. The code solely relies on NgRx state management without demonstrating any persistence mechanism.

11. **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
    Although the Angular project is set up with routing (using --routing during project creation), no routing configurations or navigation logic are provided in the code. This indicates that URL structure maintenance is not fully demonstrated.

12. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
    The provided code lacks any explicit logic or components to handle or display an empty state (e.g., a message when there are no todos). This aspect appears to be missing.

13. **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
    The application implements form submission handlers in both the AppComponent (for adding new todos) and TodoItemComponent (for editing a todo), indicating correct handling of form submissions.

14. **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
    The architecture includes a parent AppComponent and child components (TodoItemComponent and TodoFooterComponent) with clear communication via inputs and outputs. This suggests that component relationships are appropriately managed, though the complete integration details are not fully displayed.

15. **Fail** (90%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
    While several core functionalities (adding, editing, toggling, and deleting todos) are migrated, some business logic elements such as filtering, persistence to local storage, URL navigation, and handling empty states are missing. This indicates that not all original business logic has been fully preserved.
