# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
   
   The provided code clearly uses Angular modern framework features. The imports are from '@angular/core' and other Angular packages, and the structure follows the Angular 14.x pattern with NgModules, components, and services.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS
   
   The code uses ES modules syntax with import/export statements throughout the code snippets, which is standard for Angular 14.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management
   
   The code properly imports and configures NgRx store in the app.module.ts with `StoreModule.forRoot({ todos: todoReducer })` and implements a reducer in todo.reducer.ts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects
   
   Effects are implemented using @ngrx/effects with `EffectsModule.forRoot([TodoEffects])` in the app.module.ts and a TodoEffects class is defined.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management
   
   The code includes actions (addTodo), a reducer with an initial state and handlers for the actions, and effects for side effects like persistence. The components select from the store with `this.store.select()`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator
   
   The TodoStorageService and TodoEffects properly use the @Injectable() decorator.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service
   
   The TodoStorageService implements get() and put() methods that interact with localStorage using the appropriate APIs.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators
   
   The AppComponent and TodoItemComponent both use the @Component decorator with required properties like selector and templateUrl.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators
   
   The AutoFocusDirective uses the @Directive decorator with a selector property set to '[appAutoFocus]'.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)
   
   The templates properly use Angular syntax with *ngFor for list iteration and *ngIf for conditional rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))
   
   Event binding is properly implemented with (ngSubmit) in the app.component.html form.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])
   
   While there is property binding with [todo] in the todo-item component, there is no explicit example of [class.completed] or similar class bindings in the provided code. However, basic property binding is correctly implemented.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed
   
   The AutoFocusDirective implements ngAfterViewInit(). While not all components have lifecycle hooks, the ones that need them (like the directive) do implement them correctly.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models
   
   While there is a TodoState interface, the actual todo items are typed as 'any[]' in multiple places, including the store and component. Proper TypeScript interfaces for the todo items themselves are missing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services
   
   Dependency injection is correctly implemented in components (Store in AppComponent) and services (Actions in TodoEffects).

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions
   
   The code generally follows Angular naming conventions with kebab-case for filenames and PascalCase for class names. However, without seeing all files, we can't fully assess the file structure.

- **Pass** (70%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings
   
   There are no obvious errors in the code that would cause console errors, but without runtime execution, we cannot be 100% certain.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)
   
   The code has several instances of using 'any' type, particularly for todo items, which is not a best practice in TypeScript. It should use appropriate interfaces instead.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code
   
   The provided code does not contain TODOs or commented-out code sections.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design
   
   The components have clear responsibilities: AppComponent for the overall app and TodoItemComponent for individual todo items. The services and store are also well-separated by concerns.
