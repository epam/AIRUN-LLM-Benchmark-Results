# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The provided migration clearly indicates the usage of Angular 14.x since the modules and bootstrapping code correspond to that version.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
  The code uses standard ES module syntax with import statements, indicating ES modules are in use.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
  The AppModule imports StoreModule.forRoot with a todoReducer, showing that @ngrx/store is integrated.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
  EffectsModule.forRoot is used and a TodoEffects class is defined, which confirms the implementation of @ngrx/effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
  The solution includes action definitions in todo.actions.ts, a reducer in todo.reducer.ts, and effects in todo.effects.ts. Although explicit selectors are not created as separate named functions, the state is accessed via store.select in the component. This meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
  The TodoStorageService is correctly annotated with @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
  The TodoStorageService implements get() and put() methods that interact with localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
  Both AppComponent and TodoItemComponent are defined using the @Component decorator.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
  The AutoFocusDirective is implemented using the @Directive decorator and follows the Angular directive pattern.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
  Templates use *ngFor to iterate over lists and *ngIf for conditional rendering, consistent with Angular syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
  The app.component.html uses (ngSubmit) on the form, and event binding is implemented correctly. Although a (click) example isn’t shown, the existing event binding correctly follows Angular conventions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
  The code demonstrates property binding via [ngModel] and the use of input bindings in components. While a specific [class.completed] example is not present, the property binding within the context is correctly applied.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
  The AutoFocusDirective implements ngAfterViewInit correctly to handle post-view initialization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
  The todo.reducer.ts defines a TodoState interface, thereby incorporating TypeScript interfaces for state modeling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
  Angular’s DI is correctly utilized in constructors across components (AppComponent) and services (TodoStorageService).

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code generally adheres to common Angular style patterns, such as modular imports, separation of concerns, and file naming conventions. However, a few improvements (such as extracting selectors or further coding style refinements) could make it even clearer.  
  (Explanation: The implementation is sound, but some decisions—like using inline selectors in components or not having separately defined selectors—might be open to style guide interpretation.)

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
  Based on the code review, there are no apparent syntax errors or misconfigurations that would lead to runtime console errors or warnings.  
  (Explanation: Without running the actual application, the evaluation is based solely on code inspection.)

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
  The code uses TypeScript decorators, interfaces, and ES module imports appropriately; however, more explicit type annotations (for example, on component inputs or service methods) could enhance clarity.  
  (Explanation: The code leverages TypeScript, but there is room for additional type strictness.)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
  There are no TODO comments or commented-out code blocks in the provided solution.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design  
  Each component, service, and directive is structured with a focused responsibility, adhering to the single responsibility principle.
