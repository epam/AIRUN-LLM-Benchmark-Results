# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list  
   The provided solution uses the AppComponent template with an *ngFor loop that iterates over the todos and renders an <app-todo-item> for each. This fulfills the requirement.

2. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos  
   The solution provides a form in AppComponent’s template with an input bound to "newTodo" and an (ngSubmit) event ("addTodo()"), but it does not encapsulate this functionality in a dedicated component for adding todos. Additionally, the actual addTodo method is not implemented in AppComponent.

3. **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos  
   There is no dedicated component or clear implementation for editing a todo. The solution only includes a TodoItemComponent for displaying todos without edit logic.

4. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos  
   The provided code does not include any dedicated component or view logic to filter todos (e.g., showing All, Active, or Completed items).

5. **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics  
   There is no presentation of todo count statistics (e.g., displaying the number of remaining todos) in the given components or templates.

6. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos  
   Although an addTodo action is declared and a form exists for adding todos, the actual functionality (such as the implementation of addTodo() within AppComponent and linking the form to the store dispatch) is missing.

7. **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos  
   There is no code provided that supports editing an existing todo (for example, an input for editing with proper event handling).

8. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos  
   The solution does not include any action, reducer case, or UI element that allows a user to delete a todo.

9. **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed  
   While the reducer sets a new todo’s completed property to false, there is no provided functionality (action, component logic, or UI control) to mark a todo as completed.

10. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)  
    No filtering implementation or UI controls (such as buttons or links for different filters) are present in the submitted solution.

11. **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete  
    There is no indication of a bulk-complete or bulk-incomplete feature in the code.

12. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos  
    The solution does not demonstrate any functionality for clearing completed todos.

13. **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos  
    No code is provided that calculates or displays how many todos are yet to be completed.

14. **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage  
    The solution includes a TodoStorageService with methods to get and put todos using localStorage, and the TodoEffects file mentions persisting todos in a tap operator. However, the integration between these and the UI flow is only hinted at, which is why the pass confidence is slightly less than 100%.

15. **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization  
    Although TodoStorageService has a get() method to load todos, there is no demonstrated integration (e.g., in the AppComponent or in an initialization effect) that reads persisted todos on application startup.

16. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing  
    There is no implementation in the provided solution for handling escape key presses to cancel an edit operation.

17. **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo  
    An AutoFocusDirective is provided, which generally could auto-focus an element, but it is not shown being applied to an input field in an editing context. The code does not demonstrate its use when editing a todo.

18. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original  
    The solution includes minimal template code and no styling or CSS adjustments, so there is no confirmation that it retains the original AngularJS visual appearance.

19. **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately  
    There is no validation logic within the provided code to manage or prevent empty todo titles.

20. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter  
    Although an AppRoutingModule is imported, there is no evidence that the URL is updated dynamically when filters (such as All, Active, Completed) are selected.
