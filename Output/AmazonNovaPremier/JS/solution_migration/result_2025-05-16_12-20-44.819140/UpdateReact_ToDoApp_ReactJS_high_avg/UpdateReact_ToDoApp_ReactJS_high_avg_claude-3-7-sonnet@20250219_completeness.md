# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (80%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed

    The provided code shows the implementation of a Redux action `addTodo` and mentions handling todos, but there is no explicit code showing the input field implementation with an Enter key event handler. While we can see the Redux action that would be dispatched, we don't see the actual component code with the input field and the keypress event handler.

- **Fail** (85%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter

    The code includes a `TodoList` component that maps over todos, but there's no complete implementation showing how filtering is applied to the displayed list. While the routing setup suggests filter states (`ALL_TODOS`, `ACTIVE_TODOS`, `COMPLETED_TODOS`), the actual filtering logic and its connection to the rendered list is not fully demonstrated.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos

    The code mentions "Other reducers..." in the todoSlice, but doesn't explicitly include a reducer or action for toggling all todos at once. A complete implementation would include this specific functionality.

- **Fail** (70%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted

    The code shows a `TodoItem` component with an `onToggle` prop and mentions "Event handlers...", but doesn't fully implement the toggle, edit, and delete functionality. While the structure is there, the actual event handlers and their connection to Redux actions are not completely shown.

- **Fail** (75%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode

    The `TodoItem` component has an `isEditing` state, suggesting editing functionality, but there's no explicit double-click event handler that sets this state to true. The complete implementation of this feature is not shown.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo

    While the code shows a functional component structure with state management that could support this feature, the specific keypress handler for submitting an edited todo is not explicitly included.

- **Fail** (95%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value

    The code has state management for editing (`isEditing` state), but does not explicitly show the keypress handler for the Escape key or the logic to restore the original value.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items

    The code does not include an implementation of a footer component or any logic to count and display active items.

- **Fail** (95%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)

    While the routing setup in Step 1 suggests these filters exist, there is no actual footer component implementation showing the filter buttons or their connection to the router.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos

    There is no implementation of a "clear completed" button or the corresponding Redux action/reducer shown in the code.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence

    The code does not include any localStorage implementation for persisting todos between sessions.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state

    While the component structure suggests conditional rendering could be implemented, there are no explicit conditional rendering examples (like showing/hiding the footer based on having todos).

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count

    There is no implementation showing pluralization logic for item counts in the footer or elsewhere.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components

    The code demonstrates good component composition principles by splitting the app into smaller components like `TodoApp`, `TodoList`, and `TodoItem`. The answer explicitly mentions "Split components into smaller parts" and provides an example of this approach.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality

    The code clearly organizes files by feature/functionality, with separate files for components, Redux store, and slices. The structure shows a modern approach with distinct files for `TodoApp.tsx`, `TodoItem.tsx`, `TodoList.tsx`, and proper Redux organization in `store/todoSlice.ts`.
