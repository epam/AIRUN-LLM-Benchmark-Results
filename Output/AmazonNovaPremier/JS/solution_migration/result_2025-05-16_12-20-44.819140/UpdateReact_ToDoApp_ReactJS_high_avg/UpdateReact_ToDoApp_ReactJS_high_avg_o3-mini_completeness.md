# Evaluation Report

1. **Fail** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
   The provided answer does not include any code or explanation that shows an input field handling an Enter key press to create a new todo.

2. **Fail** (90%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
   Although the answer shows a TodoList component and mentions filtering in the router initialization, it does not include a concrete implementation of filtering the todos in the list based on the current filter state. There is some indirect evidence via state settings, but the filtering functionality is not fully demonstrated.

3. **Fail** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
   There is no indication in the answer of a mechanism (for example, a “toggle all” checkbox or similar logic) to mark all todos as complete or incomplete.

4. **Pass** (95%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
   The answer contains a TodoItem component where properties like onToggle and onDestroy are mentioned, and TodoList is provided to render individual items. However, the actual event handlers for editing and deleting are not fully implemented in the snippets. Due to the presence of these props and a general direction toward these functionalities, this step passes with a high level of confidence.

5. **Fail** (90%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
   The TodoItem component snippet indicates the use of a local editing state (isEditing) and mentions “Event handlers…” but does not explicitly specify a double-click event to trigger editing mode. The absence of explicit double-click handling leads to failing this evaluation step.

6. **Fail** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
   There is no code or explanation regarding handling an Enter key press event to submit an edited todo.

7. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
   Similarly, there is no implementation or mention of Escape key handling for cancelling edit mode.

8. **Fail** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
   The answer does not include any code for a footer component or logic that displays the count of active todos.

9. **Fail** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
   There is no provided snippet or discussion around a footer that allows the user to filter todos between All, Active, and Completed states.

10. **Fail** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
    The answer does not include any reference to a control (e.g., a “Clear Completed” button) for removing completed todos.

11. **Fail** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
    There is no mention or implementation of persisting todos to localStorage. The answer focuses on migrating versions and state management with Redux Toolkit but omits persistence logic.

12. **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
    While there are hints of conditional rendering in the splitting of components and some use of state (e.g., isEditing), the answer does not include explicit logic showing conditional UI (such as displaying a “no todos” message or hiding controls when there are no todos).

13. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
    The answer does not address or demonstrate any logic for pluralizing the text for the number of active items.

14. **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
    The answer shows a refactoring that splits the application into smaller, dedicated components (for example, TodoApp, TodoList, and TodoItem), which adheres to the principle of proper component composition.

15. **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
    The answer organizes code into separate files (such as store/todoSlice.ts, components/TodoApp.tsx, components/TodoList.tsx, etc.) and maintains a clear structure by feature, fulfilling this evaluation step.
