# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'
  
  The code includes a header component with the 'header' class and a nested h1 element with the 'header-title' class containing the text "Virtual Piano".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons
  
  The code includes a div with class 'btn-container' that contains two buttons - one with class 'btn btn-notes' and text "Notes", and another with class 'btn btn-letters' and text "Letters".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)
  
  The Piano component renders natural keys (c, d, e, f, g, a, b) and sharp keys (c♯, d♯, f♯, g♯, a♯) with appropriate handling for the gap where there is no sharp key.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes
  
  PianoKey component includes data attributes: `data-letter={letter}` and `data-note={note}` for each key.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked
  
  The Piano component includes event handlers for mouse actions that call the play method on the appropriate audio element when a key is clicked via `handlePlay` and `handleStop` functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)
  
  The PianoKey component adds 'piano-key-active' class to keys that are in the activeNotes state array.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes
  
  The Piano component includes keyboard event listeners (keydown/keyup) that trigger the appropriate piano key functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked
  
  The App component maintains a showLetters state that is toggled by the Notes/Letters buttons and passed to the Piano component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes
  
  The App component includes a fullscreen button with toggleFullscreen callback that uses requestFullscreen and exitFullscreen APIs.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly
  
  While the code tracks active notes in state, there is a flaw in the implementation. When using the `setActiveNotes([...activeNotes, note])` inside the `handlePlay` function, it's using a stale closure over the activeNotes array when multiple keys are pressed in quick succession, which can lead to keys being missed. A more reliable implementation would use the functional setState pattern: `setActiveNotes(prev => [...prev, note])`.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys
  
  The provided code only includes mouse down, up, and leave events. There is no implementation for handling dragging across keys, which would require mouseenter events to trigger keys as the cursor moves over them while the mouse button is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information
  
  The code includes a footer element with class 'footer' that contains a div with class 'footer-container' and the text "2023".
