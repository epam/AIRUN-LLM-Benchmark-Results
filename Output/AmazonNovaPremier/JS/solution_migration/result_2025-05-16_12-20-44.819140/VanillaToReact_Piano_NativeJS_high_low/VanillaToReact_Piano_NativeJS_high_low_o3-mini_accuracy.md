# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration  
  The instructions include using "npx create-react-app virtual-piano --template typescript" and installing the necessary types, which indicates the application is scaffolded correctly for React 18 with TypeScript.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure  
  The code defines an interface "SoundMap" for mapping note keys to HTMLAudioElement instances, thereby meeting the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks  
  All components (App, Piano, PianoKey) are implemented as functional components and make use of hooks like useState, useEffect, and useCallback.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)  
  State is managed appropriately (e.g., "activeNotes" using useState), and side effects like event listener attachments are managed within useEffect.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels  
  The Piano component adds keyboard event listeners (keydown, keyup) at the window level, which is appropriate for capturing keyboard interactions for the entire application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseleave) are implemented using React synthetic events  
  Mouse events are handled using onMouseDown, onMouseUp, and onMouseLeave on the PianoKey component, leveraging React's event system.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment  
  Audio resources are created using new Audio() and stored in a mapping. Although more sophisticated preloading might be used in larger applications, the code works within the React environment as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility  
  The fullscreen functionality is implemented using a callback that checks for the current fullscreen state and then calls requestFullscreen() or exitFullscreen(), which is acceptable for modern browsers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns  
  Conditional class names are applied using template literals (e.g., for the Piano and PianoKey components), which is a well-established React pattern.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate  
  The PianoKey component is wrapped in React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders, which is an effective performance optimization.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations  
  Event listeners are attached and cleaned up within useEffect, ensuring that audio playback triggers (via onPlay and onStop callbacks) function correctly within the React lifecycle.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application  
  TypeScript is used consistently with interfaces for props and other data structures, ensuring strict typing across the application.
