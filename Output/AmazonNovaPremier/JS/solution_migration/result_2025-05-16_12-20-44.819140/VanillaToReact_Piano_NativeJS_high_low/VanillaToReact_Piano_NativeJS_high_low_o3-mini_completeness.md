# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'  
  The App component includes a header element with a child h1 element whose text content is "Virtual Piano".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons  
  The App component renders a div with class "btn-container" that contains two buttons labeled "Notes" and "Letters", with conditional classes based on the toggle state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)  
  The Piano component maps over two arrays – one for natural notes and one for sharp keys – and renders a PianoKey for each (or a placeholder div for gaps in the sharp keys array).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes  
  The PianoKey component defines data-letter and data-note attributes on the rendered div element, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked  
  The handlePlay callback in the Piano component calls play() on an audio element from the soundMapper when a corresponding note key is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)  
  Active keys are tracked using the activeNotes state; PianoKey applies conditional CSS classes (including "piano-key-active") based on active state.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes  
  Although the code adds keydown and keyup event listeners on window, it attempts to match a pressed key with a note by accessing soundMapper[note].dataset.letter. Standard HTMLAudioElement objects do not automatically include a dataset property (as they are not HTMLElements), so unless these audio elements have been explicitly augmented with dataset information elsewhere, the keyboard functionality may not work as intended.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked  
  The App component manages a showLetters state that is toggled by the "Notes" and "Letters" buttons, and this state is passed down to the Piano component for conditional rendering of keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes  
  A button in App calls toggleFullscreen, which checks document.fullscreenElement and either requests or exits fullscreen accordingly.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly  
  The Piano component maintains an array of active notes and uses this list to manage playing/stopping audio. However, the event handlers (handlePlay/handleStop) rely on the current state without using a functional update. This approach can potentially lead to race conditions or missed updates when several keys are pressed in rapid succession. Although the intent is clear, the implementation might not be entirely robust in scenarios with high concurrency. (Confidence: 80% due to potential state update pitfalls)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys  
  The PianoKey component registers onMouseDown, onMouseUp, and onMouseLeave events. The onMouseLeave event in particular helps ensure that if the mouse is dragged out of a key, the note is stopped – addressing typical mouse drag interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information  
  The App component renders a footer element containing a div with the year "2023".
