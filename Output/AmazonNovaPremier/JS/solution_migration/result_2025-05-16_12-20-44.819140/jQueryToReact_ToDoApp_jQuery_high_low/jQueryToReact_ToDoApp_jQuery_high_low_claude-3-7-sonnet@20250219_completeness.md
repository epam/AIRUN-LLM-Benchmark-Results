# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos

    The code includes a `Header.tsx` component with a "todos" title and an input field with the class "new-todo" that has proper onChange handling and a handleSubmit function to create new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos

    The application is structured with a main TodoList component mentioned in App.tsx. However, the specific toggle-all checkbox implementation is not shown in the provided code, though the structure for the todo list is present.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button

    While the Todo.tsx component includes a toggle checkbox and title display (label), the delete functionality for the destroy button is not implemented. The button exists but has no onClick handler or associated action dispatch.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode

    The provided code does not implement the double-click functionality to enable editing mode for todo items. There's no onDoubleClick handler on the todo label, nor is there editing state management.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)

    The code includes filtering functionality in the todosSlice.ts with a filter state and selectors for filtered todos. The setFilter action is available, but the actual filter UI components are not completely shown in the provided code, though they are mentioned in the project structure.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization

    The Footer component is mentioned but not implemented in the provided code. There is no code showing the display of remaining todos count or pluralization logic.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter

    While the filter state exists in Redux, the Footer component with filter links is not implemented in the provided code. There is no UI showing filter links or logic to highlight the current selection.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist

    The clearCompleted action is defined in the Redux slice, but the Footer component with the 'Clear completed' button and conditional display logic is not implemented in the provided code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter

    The Header component has a proper implementation for creating new todos: it captures input changes, handles Enter key press, validates non-empty input, dispatches the addTodo action, and clears the input field afterward.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos

    The toggleTodo action and the checkbox functionality in the Todo component are properly implemented, allowing for toggling individual todo completion status.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once

    There is no implementation for toggling all todos at once in the provided code. Neither the Redux actions nor the UI components include this functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management

    The code does not implement todo editing functionality. There's no edit mode, input field for editing, or focus management logic present.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos

    While the destroy button exists in the Todo component, there is no implemented onClick handler or associated Redux action to delete individual todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos

    The clearCompleted reducer is implemented in the todosSlice.ts file, which correctly filters out completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status

    The selectFilteredTodos selector in todosSlice.ts properly implements filtering logic based on the selected filter (all, active, completed).
