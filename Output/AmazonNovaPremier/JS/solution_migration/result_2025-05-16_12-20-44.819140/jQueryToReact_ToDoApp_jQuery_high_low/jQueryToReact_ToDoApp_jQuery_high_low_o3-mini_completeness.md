# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos  
   The Header component clearly renders an element with the title “todos” and an input field for entering new todo items.

2. **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos  
   While the main section is present in App.tsx and includes the header, TodoList, and Footer components, there is no visible implementation for a "toggle-all" checkbox.

3. **Pass** (95%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button  
   The Todo component includes a checkbox (for toggling), a label to display the title, and a button with class "destroy" that implies deletion. However, the delete button does not have an event handler attached for deletion, which introduces a slight concern. Hence, it is marked as “Pass” for UI presence with minor functional incompleteness.

4. **Fail** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode  
   There is no implementation or event handling (such as onDoubleClick) that suggests an editing mode is triggered for a todo item.

5. **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
   Although the Redux slice includes a filter state and filtering logic in the selector, no UI component (e.g., TodoFilters) is explicitly implemented in the provided code snippet to allow users to change the filter via the interface.

6. **Fail** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization  
   The Footer component is mentioned in the project structure and imported in App.tsx, but its implementation is not provided, so we cannot confirm if it correctly displays the count with proper pluralization.

7. **Fail** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter  
   Similar to step 6, although filtering is logically managed in the redux slice, there is no provided code for Footer that shows filter links or visual highlighting for the selected filter.

8. **Fail** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist  
   While the todosSlice includes a reducer called clearCompleted, the UI element (a button in the Footer or elsewhere) to trigger clearing completed todos is not shown in the provided code.

9. **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter  
   The Header component handles new todo creation by listening for the Enter key press in the input, dispatching the addTodo action when the input is valid.

10. **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos  
    In the Todo component, the checkbox’s onChange event dispatches the toggleTodo action, allowing individual todos to change their completion state.

11. **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once  
    There is no implementation of a “toggle-all” checkbox or similar functionality to switch the state of all todos simultaneously in the provided code.

12. **Fail** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management  
    There is no code handling editing mode (such as onDoubleClick to activate an editable field or mechanisms for managing input focus during editing).

13. **Fail** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos  
    Although a delete button (with class "destroy") appears in the Todo component, there is no implemented handler to delete a todo item individually.

14. **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos  
    The redux slice provides a clearCompleted reducer, but there is no UI element provided to invoke this action, meaning this functionality is incomplete from a user perspective.

15. **Fail** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status  
    The filtering logic exists in the todosSlice (via selectFilteredTodos), but without a visible UI to trigger and display filtered results, it is not fully validated.
