# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up in the test file
  
  The answer includes proper setup instructions for Jest and React Testing Library with the correct npm installation command and configuration in package.json.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test cases are properly isolated and do not have interdependencies
  
  Each test case is isolated in its own `it` block with its own render call, preventing state sharing between tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that DOM events are simulated using proper React Testing Library methods
  
  The answer correctly uses userEvent for simulating user interactions like clicks and keyboard navigation.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate that accessibility attributes are being tested appropriately
  
  The answer includes tests for aria-label and aria-expanded attributes. However, it could have been more comprehensive with additional accessibility attribute testing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure mocks are used for external dependencies where appropriate
  
  The answer uses jest.fn() to mock the onChange handler, which is the appropriate approach.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify proper use of async/await for asynchronous testing where needed
  
  The answer doesn't include any async/await patterns for asynchronous testing. While React Testing Library encourages waitFor or findBy queries for async testing, none are present in the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all assertions use appropriate Jest matchers
  
  The assertions use appropriate Jest matchers like toBeInTheDocument(), toBeVisible(), toHaveAttribute(), etc.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that tests include proper cleanup after each test case
  
  The answer doesn't include explicit cleanup after tests. While React Testing Library automatically handles some cleanup with render, there's no mention of cleanup or afterEach hooks.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test descriptions clearly indicate what functionality is being tested
  
  The test descriptions are clear and concise, accurately describing the functionality being tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the test file follows best practices for organizing test cases (describe/it blocks)
  
  The code follows best practices with a top-level describe block and individual it blocks for specific test cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that all event handlers are tested using appropriate simulation methods
  
  The answer shows proper testing of event handlers with appropriate simulation methods like userEvent.click and userEvent.type.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the test environment correctly simulates both mouse and keyboard interactions
  
  The answer includes testing for both mouse clicks and keyboard navigation, though touch events are not explicitly covered.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for touch events properly simulate mobile interactions
  
  The answer doesn't include any tests for touch events or mobile interactions.
