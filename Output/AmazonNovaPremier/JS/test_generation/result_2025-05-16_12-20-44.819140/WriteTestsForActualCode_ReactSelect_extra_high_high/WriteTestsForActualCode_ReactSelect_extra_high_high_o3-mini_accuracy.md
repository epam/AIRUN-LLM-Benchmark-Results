# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up in the test file  
  The answer shows npm commands to install Jest and the required testing libraries and includes the proper configuration in package.json.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test cases are properly isolated and do not have interdependencies  
  The tests are organized using describe/it blocks, and each test appears to run independently of the others.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that DOM events are simulated using proper React Testing Library methods  
  Keyboard events (using userEvent.type) and mouse events (using userEvent.click) are simulated with appropriate methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that accessibility attributes are being tested appropriately  
  The answer includes tests verifying roles (combobox, option, listbox) and ARIA attributes (aria-label, aria-expanded).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure mocks are used for external dependencies where appropriate  
  A mock function (jest.fn()) is used for the onChange handler, which is a suitable approach to isolate the component event handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of async/await for asynchronous testing where needed  
  Although there are no asynchronous events in these tests, the absence of async/await is appropriate given the synchronous nature of the component interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all assertions use appropriate Jest matchers  
  The assertions employ matchers such as toBeInTheDocument, toHaveFocus, toBeVisible, and toHaveBeenCalledWith, which are standard and suitable.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that tests include proper cleanup after each test case  
  The tests rely on React Testing Libraryâ€™s built-in automatic cleanup. While not explicitly stated, this default behavior is acceptable. (Slight uncertainty stems from the absence of an explicit cleanup step, though it is managed by the library.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test descriptions clearly indicate what functionality is being tested  
  Each test has a descriptive name (e.g., "renders with default props", "handles keyboard navigation") clearly indicating its purpose.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the test file follows best practices for organizing test cases (describe/it blocks)  
  The tests are organized within a describe block with individual it blocks for each test, following common best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that all event handlers are tested using appropriate simulation methods  
  The provided tests simulate both clicking and typing events using userEvent, which is appropriate for testing event handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the test environment correctly simulates both mouse and keyboard interactions  
  The tests include both mouse clicks and keyboard interactions, ensuring that both input methods are correctly simulated.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for touch events properly simulate mobile interactions  
  The answer does not include any tests or simulations for touch events, which are necessary for simulating mobile interactions in some contexts.
