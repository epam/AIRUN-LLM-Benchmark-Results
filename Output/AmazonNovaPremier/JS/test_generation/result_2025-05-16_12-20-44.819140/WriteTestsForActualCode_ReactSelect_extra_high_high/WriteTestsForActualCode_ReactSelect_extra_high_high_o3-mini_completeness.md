# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist  
  The answer includes a test under "Component Rendering Tests" that verifies the component renders with default props.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present  
  The answer includes a keyboard navigation test using the arrow key (arrowdown) but does not cover the full range of keys (tab, enter, escape) as specified. The evaluation is 90% confident because only partial keyboard behavior is tested.

- **Fail** (90%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)  
  A test for mouse clicking is present ("handles mouse click"), but there is no corresponding test for hover interactions. This step is therefore considered incomplete.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior  
  The provided tests cover basic default rendering and a state update on selection, but they do not explicitly differentiate between controlled and uncontrolled scenarios.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values  
  There is a test for updating the value on selection, but tests for removing and clearing selected values are missing.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented  
  A mouse click test that reveals the menu is present, but there is no explicit test to check the closing behavior of the menu.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality  
  The answer includes a test ("filters options correctly") that verifies option filtering based on the input value.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist  
  There is no test provided that specifically handles or validates multi-select behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility  
  Tests exist that check for accessibility attributes (e.g., aria-label and aria-expanded) ensuring screen reader compatibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested  
  An edge case is addressed with a test ("shows no options message") when no options are provided.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states  
  There is mention of loading/error states in the documentation comment, but no actual test cases have been provided to validate these scenarios.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states  
  The tests do not include any scenarios where the options or component are disabled.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance  
  A performance test is included that renders 1000 options and checks that all are present.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested  
  While there is a test checking that an option receives focus after an arrow navigation event, the coverage is minimal, and additional focus management scenarios are not tested. This step is marked pass with a slight reservation.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering  
  There are no tests provided that explicitly verify the rendering of placeholder text or the selected value display.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations  
  The provided tests do not include any scenarios related to custom rendering via formatOptionLabel.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)  
  The test for onChange is present ("updates value on selection"), but tests for onInputChange, onMenuOpen, and onMenuClose are missing.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)  
  There are no tests verifying the rendering or functionality of indicator components such as dropdown arrows, clear icons, or loading indicators.
