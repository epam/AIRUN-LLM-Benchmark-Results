# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources

    The provided tests only check that REST.blocks and REST.content are defined but don't comprehensively test all resources that might be in the factory. The test also starts to check the configuration for blocks resource but doesn't verify all resources thoroughly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly

    The Page factory test properly verifies initialization of default values for the Page.id and Page.title properties.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly

    There are no tests provided for the Users factory in the submitted answer.

- **Fail** (80%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods

    While there is a test for the deletePage() method, the answer mentions "Add tests for other methods..." indicating that not all public methods are covered. Only initialization and deletePage() are tested, with no tests for other methods like saveLocal, autocompleteTags, savePage, etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller

    The tests include a specific test for initialization under the "Initialization" describe block, which verifies that the page title is initialized to an empty string.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation

    There are no tests provided for the titleChange function in the submitted answer.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction

    There are spies set up for localStorage.getItem and localStorage.setItem, but no actual tests for the saveLocal function are implemented in the submitted answer.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality

    There are no tests provided for the autocompleteTags function in the submitted answer.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)

    There are no tests provided for the savePage function in the submitted answer.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types

    The submitted answer does not include tests for edge cases like empty URLs and page types.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly

    The tests for the deletePage() function verify that the REST.content.delete method is called and that there is a redirect to 'new' after successful deletion.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions

    There are no tests provided for handling page versions and localStorage interactions in the submitted answer.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components

    While the answer mentions running tests with coverage, it doesn't provide information about achieving 80% coverage. Given the incomplete tests presented, it's clear that 80% coverage would not be achieved.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling

    There are no tests provided for event broadcasting and handling in the submitted answer.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality

    There are no tests provided for date handling and scheduling functionality in the submitted answer.
