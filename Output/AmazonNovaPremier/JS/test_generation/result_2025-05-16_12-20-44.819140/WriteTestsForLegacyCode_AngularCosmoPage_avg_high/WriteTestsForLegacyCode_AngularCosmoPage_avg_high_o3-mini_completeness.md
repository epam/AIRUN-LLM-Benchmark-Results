# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (80%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources  
  Although the REST Factory tests verify that REST.blocks and REST.content are defined and that the blocks resource is configured correctly, they only check two specific resources with a comment suggesting "Add all other resources." This does not conclusively cover all defined resources.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly  
  The provided Page factory test only checks for "id" and "title" properties. If the Page factory is meant to initialize additional properties, these are not verified.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly  
  There are no unit tests provided for a Users factory in the answer.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods  
  The controller tests only cover page initialization and the deletePage() method, leaving any other public methods untested.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller  
  The test labeled "should initialize page properties" confirms that the page initialization (e.g., title defaulting to an empty string) is functioning as expected.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation  
  No tests targeting a titleChange function or its URL auto-generation behavior are present in the answer.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction  
  While there are spies set up for localStorage interactions in the pageCtrl tests, there is no specific test for a saveLocal function or its expected behavior.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality  
  There is no unit test in the answer that addresses the autocompleteTags functionality or tag suggestion behavior.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)  
  No tests for a savePage function are provided, leaving all conditional branches unverified.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types  
  Edge cases such as empty URL values and different page types are not tested according to the provided answer.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly  
  The deletion functionality in the pageCtrl is tested by checking that REST.content.delete is called and that after deletion, the application redirects via $location.path.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions  
  There is no test verifying the handling of page versions or the associated interaction with localStorage beyond what is minimally set up.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components  
  Although a command to run tests with coverage is provided, there is no evidence that the tests actually achieve 80%+ code coverage across the components.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling  
  No tests are provided to validate event broadcasting or the handling of broadcasted events.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality  
  There are no tests covering any date handling or scheduling functionalities that might exist in the application.
