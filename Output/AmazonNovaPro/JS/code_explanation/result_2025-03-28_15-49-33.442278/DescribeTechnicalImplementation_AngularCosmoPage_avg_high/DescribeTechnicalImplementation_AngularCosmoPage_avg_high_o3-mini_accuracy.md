# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies Angular.js as the framework used  
  The documentation’s title and context refer explicitly to Angular.js.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all factories (REST, Page, Users) are accurately documented with their purposes  
  Each factory is listed with clear descriptions of its role (e.g., API communication for REST, global data storage for Page and Users).

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of the Page controller and its functionality is technically accurate  
  The pageCtrl controller is described as managing page creation, editing, and user interactions, which is aligned with common Angular.js patterns.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate that the RESTful API endpoints are correctly documented  
  The REST Factory is documented to interact with various endpoints (blocks, comments, content, etc.). While the endpoints are mentioned correctly, more detail could enhance clarity.  
  (Reason for less than 100%: The documentation lists endpoints without in-depth description.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of Angular module dependencies ($resource, $location, etc.) is correct  
  The dependencies are mentioned appropriately both in the REST Factory (using $resource) and in the pageCtrl controller (listing $location, $rootScope, $routeParams, $upload, and $translate).

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that the page management features (creating, editing, deleting) are accurately described  
  The controller’s responsibilities include saving, deleting, and updating pages. Although deletion is only briefly mentioned, the core page management functionalities are well covered.  
  (Reason for less than 100%: The deletion process is not elaborated upon in detail.)

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the documentation accurately explains how the local storage mechanism works  
  The documentation notes that local storage is managed for unsaved changes. However, additional specifics on how this mechanism is implemented would improve the explanation.

- **Fail** (100%): Check that the description of form validation logic is technically accurate  
  There is no mention of form validation logic in the documentation, which leaves a gap regarding how user input is verified.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of publish/schedule date handling is correct  
  The publish field and scheduleDate are clearly documented, including expected data types and usage (e.g., 'Y', 'N', 'schedule' for publish).

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the tag management and autocomplete feature explanation is technically accurate  
  While tags are cited as an array associated with pages, there is no further explanation regarding any autocomplete features or detailed tag management.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that the relationship between controllers, factories, and templates is accurately explained  
  The documentation outlines the roles of controllers and factories but does not explain how these components interact with view templates.  
  (Reason for less than 100%: The linkage between templates and the other components is not explicitly discussed.)

- **Fail** (100%): Check that the documentation correctly identifies and explains the purpose of broadcast events  
  The documentation briefly mentions that notifications and messages are broadcasted via $rootScope, but it does not provide an in-depth explanation of these events or their purposes.
