# Evaluation Report

**Step 1: Check that a loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.**
- **Pass**: The code includes a loading state and displays "Loading..." while data is being fetched.

**Step 2: Verify that the loader does not hide the search input when data is loading.**
- **Pass**: The search input is always visible, even when the loading indicator is displayed.

**Step 3: Validate that a request with an empty search term is sent on the initial render.**
- **Pass**: On initial render, the `search` state is an empty string, triggering a request with an empty search term.

**Step 4: Verify that the search input field is present.**
- **Pass**: The search input field is present and rendered in the component.

**Step 5: Ensure that the character search functionality is implemented.**
- **Pass**: The search functionality is implemented using the `handleSearch` function, which updates the `search` state.

**Step 6: Ensure that the API request includes the search term as a query parameter.**
- **Pass**: The API request includes the search term as a query parameter in the URL.

**Step 7: Validate that the data is loading on initial app load with empty query and then when the search term changes.**
- **Pass**: Data is fetched on initial load and whenever the search term changes.

**Step 8: Ensure that the debounced fetch function prevents unnecessary API requests.**
- **Fail**: The code does not implement a debounced fetch function to prevent unnecessary API requests.

**Step 9: Confirm that the character list is updated based on the search results.**
- **Pass**: The character list is updated based on the search results.

**Step 10: Validate that the application handles API request errors.**
- **Pass**: The application handles API request errors by logging them to the console.

**Step 11: Ensure that the user experience remains smooth without backend overloads.**
- **Fail**: Without debouncing, the user experience may be affected by frequent API requests, potentially overloading the backend.
