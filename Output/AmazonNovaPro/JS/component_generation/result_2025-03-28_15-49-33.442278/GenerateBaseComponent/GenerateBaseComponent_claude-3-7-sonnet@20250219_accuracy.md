# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x
    
    The code imports from React 18.x as evidenced by the use of `ReactDOM.createRoot()` in the index.tsx file, which is a React 18 feature.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
    
    The code uses proper TypeScript syntax with type definitions for the component props (`SearchableSelectProps`), the option structure (`Option` type), and event types in handlers (e.g., `React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>`).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling
    
    The code includes an index.css file that defines styles for the searchable select component.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments
    
    The code is clean, well-structured, and does not contain any TODO comments or incomplete sections.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility
    
    The component uses React's useState hook to manage state for isOpen, searchTerm, and selectedOption.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props
    
    The component accepts an `options` prop that allows it to be reused with different sets of options.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection
    
    The component includes keyboard event handlers for Enter and Escape keys, and also provides keyboard accessibility for selecting options.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions
    
    The component uses useRef and useEffect hooks properly for DOM interactions and managing click outside behavior.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques
    
    The component uses tabIndex on both the container and list items, allowing keyboard focus. However, it could be improved by adding focus control when navigating through options using arrow keys.

- **Pass** (90%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
    
    The component includes some ARIA attributes like role="option" and aria-selected, but could be enhanced with additional ARIA attributes such as aria-expanded, aria-controls, and aria-labelledby to further improve accessibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
    
    The code does not contain any syntax errors or patterns that would generate console warnings or errors.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component
    
    The component is structured in a way that should prevent unnecessary re-renders. However, the handleClickOutside function could be wrapped in useCallback to prevent recreating it on every render.
