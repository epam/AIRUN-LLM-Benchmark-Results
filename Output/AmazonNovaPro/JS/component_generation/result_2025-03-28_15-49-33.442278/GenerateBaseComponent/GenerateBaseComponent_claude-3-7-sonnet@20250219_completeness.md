# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element
  
  The code clearly defines a React component `SearchableSelect` that renders a dropdown UI element. It includes both the input field and a dropdown list in the JSX structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown
  
  The component includes an input field of type "text" that accepts user input for searching, with the onChange handler set to `handleInputChange`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown
  
  The component maintains a `selectedOption` state variable and implements a `handleOptionSelect` function that sets this state when an option is selected.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys
  
  The code does not include any keyboard arrow key navigation functionality. There is no handler for arrow key presses to navigate through the dropdown options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key
  
  Options in the dropdown can be selected using the Enter key as implemented in the onKeyDown handler for each list item:
  ```tsx
  onKeyDown={(e) => {
    if (e.key === 'Enter') handleOptionSelect(option);
  }}
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused
  
  The `handleKeyDown` function includes logic to toggle the dropdown's visibility when the Enter key is pressed:
  ```tsx
  if (event.key === 'Enter') {
    setIsOpen(!isOpen);
  }
  ```

- **Fail** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes
  
  While the component does close the dropdown in various scenarios, there's no explicit code to return focus to the select component when the dropdown closes, except for the Escape key case.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click
  
  The `handleOptionSelect` function is called when an option is clicked, and it sets `setIsOpen(false)` to close the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard
  
  The same `handleOptionSelect` function is called when an option is selected via the Enter key, and it sets `setIsOpen(false)` to close the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed
  
  The `handleKeyDown` function includes logic to close the dropdown when the Escape key is pressed:
  ```tsx
  else if (event.key === 'Escape') {
    setIsOpen(false);
    selectRef.current?.focus();
  }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component
  
  The component implements a click-outside handler using `useEffect` and `handleClickOutside` that closes the dropdown when a click is detected outside the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused
  
  The `handleKeyDown` function includes logic to toggle the dropdown's visibility when the Enter key is pressed, which would open the dropdown if it's currently closed.
