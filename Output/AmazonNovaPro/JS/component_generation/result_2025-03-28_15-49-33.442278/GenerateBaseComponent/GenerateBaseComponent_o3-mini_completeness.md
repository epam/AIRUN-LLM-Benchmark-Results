# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component renders an <input> field and conditionally displays a <ul> with the class "dropdown" when isOpen is true, confirming the basic dropdown UI element is present.

- **Pass** (85%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  The component includes an <input> field used to filter the dropdown options. Although the input is not nested inside the <ul> element, it serves the purpose of a search field for the dropdown. The wording "within the dropdown" can be interpreted in different ways, which is why confidence is slightly less than 100%.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The implementation sets a single selectedOption when an option is clicked or selected via keyboard, ensuring only one item is selected at a time.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The code does not implement any functionality to navigate the list items using the ArrowUp or ArrowDown keys. Navigation between options via arrow keys is not supported.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  Both the input’s onKeyDown handler and the list item’s onKeyDown event correctly handle the Enter key to select an option.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  The onKeyDown event on the input toggles the dropdown's open state when Enter is pressed. Although the container div has a tabIndex, the input field is the primary focus element, which satisfies the intended behavior. Slight uncertainty comes from the focus behavior being primarily on the input rather than the entire component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  When Escape is pressed, the handler sets isOpen to false and explicitly returns focus to the container via selectRef.current?.focus().

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  The onClick event on each dropdown item calls handleOptionSelect, which sets isOpen to false.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  Each list item’s onKeyDown event checks for the Enter key and similarly calls handleOptionSelect to close the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  The input’s onKeyDown handler correctly detects the Escape key, closes the dropdown, and returns focus to the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  The useEffect hook adds an event listener on the document to detect clicks outside the component and close the dropdown accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  Pressing Enter on the input toggles the state of isOpen—opening the dropdown if it is closed and vice versa—fulfilling this requirement.
