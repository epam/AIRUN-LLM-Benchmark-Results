# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The application fetches the list of Star Wars characters from the SWAPI API (`https://swapi.dev/api/people`) using Axios and displays them in the CharacterList component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The application shows a loading indicator through the conditional rendering in the CharacterList component: `if (loading) { return <div>Loading...</div>; }`

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The application maps through all characters received from the API and renders each one in a list item: `{characters.map((character) => (<li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>))}`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  There are no search inputs or other user input fields in the provided code. The application simply displays the list of characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character is displayed in a list item that shows the character's name: `<li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The setup instructions clearly show the use of Create React App with TypeScript template: `npx create-react-app swapi-characters --template typescript`

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The CharacterList component properly manages state for:
  - Loading state: `const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(true);`
  - Error state: `const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);`
  - Character data: `const [characters, setCharacters] = useState<Character[]>([]);`

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each list item has a unique key using the character's URL: `<li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  The application adequately handles different states:
  - Loading state is shown while data is being fetched
  - Error state is shown if fetching fails
  - If characters array is empty (but no error), the list would render empty which is appropriate
