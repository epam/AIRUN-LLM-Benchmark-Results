# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses React 18.x or newer by checking the package.json dependencies  
  The use of ReactDOM.createRoot in index.tsx indicates that the project is set up using React 18 or newer.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that TypeScript is properly implemented with appropriate type definitions for all components, props, and states  
  All components, props, and states are given type definitions (using interfaces and type annotations), and the project is bootstrapped with a TypeScript template.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Axios is used for API requests to fetch data from the Star Wars API endpoint  
  The API requests are handled in the swapi.ts service file using Axios with a get request to 'https://swapi.dev/api/people'.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles API errors gracefully with appropriate error states or messages  
  The CharacterList component catches errors during the API call and sets an error state which is then displayed as an error message.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the character data is fetched on component mount using useEffect hook  
  The code correctly uses the useEffect hook with an empty dependency array to perform the data fetching on component mount.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application properly manages component rendering optimization  
  While the sample is simple, it follows best practices by conditionally rendering loading and error states and avoiding unnecessary renders via the useEffect dependency array. Given the context, no explicit optimization (such as memoization) was required.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows React best practices using hooks appropriately  
  The application uses React hooks (useState and useEffect) appropriately and adheres to standard React best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't contain any TODO comments or unnecessary code  
  The provided code does not include TODO comments or extraneous code sections, keeping the codebase clean and focused.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the codebase has minimal comments that only clarify complex logic when necessary  
  Comments in the code are minimal and purposeful, used only where they help explain non-obvious implementation details.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the API endpoint 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' is being called correctly  
  The API endpoint is correctly invoked in the swapi.ts file, and the response is handled according to standard practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application renders without console errors or warnings  
  Based on the provided implementation and adherence to best practices, there are no apparent issues that would lead to console errors or warnings.
