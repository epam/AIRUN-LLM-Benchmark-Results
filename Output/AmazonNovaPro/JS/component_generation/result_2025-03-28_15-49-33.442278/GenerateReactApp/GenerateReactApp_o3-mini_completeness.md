# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The app fetches characters from the SWAPI and displays them within a list in the CharacterList component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  While data is being fetched, the component returns a "Loading..." message, which meets this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  The implementation maps over the fetched characters and displays each character’s name in a list item.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  The provided code does not include any search or input fields, adhering to the specified requirements.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each list item is constructed using the character’s URL as the unique key and shows the character’s name.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The instructions include bootstrapping with Create React App using the TypeScript template, which satisfies this step.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The component properly manages three states: loading, error, and character data, ensuring a robust state management approach.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  The implementation uses each character’s URL as a unique key for list items, supporting optimal rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  If the fetched data array is empty, the component will render an empty list. Although it does not display a specific "no characters found" message, rendering an empty list is a valid way to handle the empty state.
