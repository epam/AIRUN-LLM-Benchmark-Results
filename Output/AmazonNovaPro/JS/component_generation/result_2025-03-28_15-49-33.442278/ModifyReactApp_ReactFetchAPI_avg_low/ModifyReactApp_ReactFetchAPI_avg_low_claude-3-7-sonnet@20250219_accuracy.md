# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type
  
  The code includes an input field with the `onChange` handler that updates the `searchQuery` state:
  ```tsx
  <input 
    type="text" 
    placeholder="Search characters..." 
    value={searchQuery} 
    onChange={handleSearch} 
  />
  ```
  
  The `handleSearch` function correctly updates the state:
  ```tsx
  const handleSearch = useCallback((event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    const query = event.target.value;
    setSearchQuery(query);
    fetchCharacters(query);
  }, [fetchCharacters]);
  ```

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls
  
  The implementation doesn't include any debouncing mechanism. The code directly calls `fetchCharacters` with each onChange event, which would trigger an API request with every keystroke. A proper implementation would include debouncing using either:
  - setTimeout/clearTimeout pattern
  - A debounce utility function (from lodash or similar)
  - A custom hook like useDebounce

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured
  
  The code properly imports and uses axios for API requests:
  ```tsx
  import axios from 'axios';
  // ...
  const response = await axios.get(`https://swapi.dev/api/people/?search=${query}`);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses
  
  The code includes proper TypeScript typing:
  - Component is defined as `React.FC`
  - Character interface is defined for API responses
  - State variables are typed (e.g., `useState<Character[]>`, `useState<string>`)
  - Function parameters are typed (e.g., `event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>`)

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters
  
  The API endpoint is correctly constructed with search parameters:
  ```tsx
  const response = await axios.get(`https://swapi.dev/api/people/?search=${query}`);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate
  
  The code appropriately uses:
  - `useCallback` for both `fetchCharacters` and `handleSearch` functions
  - `useMemo` for computing `displayCharacters` based on search state

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback
  
  Error handling is properly implemented with try/catch and appropriate user feedback:
  ```tsx
  try {
    // ...API request
  } catch (err) {
    setError('Failed to fetch characters. Please try again.');
    console.error('Failed to fetch characters:', err);
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);
  }
  ```
  
  And the error state is used to display a message to the user:
  ```tsx
  if (error) return <div>{error}</div>;
  ```

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing
  
  As noted earlier, the code doesn't implement debouncing. API calls are triggered with each keystroke, immediately when the `handleSearch` function is called, rather than waiting for the user to stop typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices
  
  The code follows React best practices for state management:
  - Uses appropriate state hooks
  - Separates concerns between different state variables
  - Avoids state updates in render functions
  - Uses functional updates where appropriate

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code
  
  The code appears clean with:
  - No commented-out code
  - No unused imports (all imported modules are used)
  - No obvious console errors (though runtime errors would need to be tested)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests
  
  Loading state is properly manage
