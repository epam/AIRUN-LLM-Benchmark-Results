# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name
  
  The code includes an input field with the placeholder "Search characters..." and an onChange handler that updates the search query and fetches filtered characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests
  
  The component includes a loading state that displays "Loading..." when the loading state is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query
  
  The useEffect hook calls fetchCharacters with an empty string on component mount.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type
  
  The handleSearch function is called on each input change, triggering a new API request with the updated query.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found
  
  There's a conditional check `displayCharacters.length === 0 && searchQuery !== ""` that displays "No results found" when appropriate.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design
  
  While there are no explicit responsive design elements in the code (like media queries or responsive CSS classes), the basic HTML structure used would adapt to different screen sizes. However, without specific responsive styling, I can't be 100% certain.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response
  
  The code maps through displayCharacters to render the list items with character names after the API response is processed.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed
  
  While there is basic error handling with try/catch and displaying an error message, there are no React Error Boundaries implemented to catch runtime errors in the component tree. The error handling is limited to API request failures, but doesn't handle rendering errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props
  
  The code defines the Character interface for API data and properly types all state variables, props, and function parameters.

- **Fail** (80%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities
  
  The implementation unnecessarily makes a new API request on every keystroke, which could overload the backend. A better approach would be to implement debouncing or to filter locally after an initial data fetch. Additionally, the code maintains both characters and filteredCharacters states which is redundant since it always sets both to the same value.
