# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type  
  The search input field uses the onChange event handler (handleSearch) to update the state (searchQuery) and trigger API calls.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls  
  The code does not implement any debouncing mechanism. Each keystroke triggers a new API call immediately without waiting for 300-500ms of inactivity.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured  
  The code uses axios.get with the correct endpoint URL and handles the API response appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses  
  The code defines a Character interface and uses TypeScript generics with useState and function parameters consistently.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters  
  The URL construction includes the search query (`?search=${query}`) correctly appended to the endpoint.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate  
  Both useCallback (for fetchCharacters and handleSearch) and useMemo (for displayCharacters) are implemented to optimize performance.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback  
  A try/catch block is used with error state management, and a user-friendly error message is displayed when failures occur.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing  
  The absence of a debouncing mechanism means API calls occur on every keystroke instead of only after the user stops typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices  
  State is managed using useState hooks appropriately, aligning with standard React practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code  
  The code is clean; there are no unused imports or commented-out code, and it includes necessary error logging.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests  
  The component sets the loading state at the beginning and end of the API request, ensuring proper management of the loading indicator.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns  
  The component uses React functional components and hooks properly in a manner consistent with React 18.x practices.
