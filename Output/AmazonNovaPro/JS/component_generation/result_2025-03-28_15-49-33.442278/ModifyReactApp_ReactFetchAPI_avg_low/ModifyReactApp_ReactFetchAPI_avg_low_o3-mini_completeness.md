# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The code includes an input element with the placeholder "Search characters..." and uses the onChange handler to trigger search functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  The component conditionally renders <div>Loading...</div> when the loading state is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  The useEffect hook calls fetchCharacters("") on mount, ensuring that initial results are loaded with an empty search query.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  The handleSearch function is appropriately set up to update the state and fetch filtered characters as the user types, ensuring dynamic updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  The code checks if displayCharacters is empty while searchQuery is non-empty and displays a "No results found" message.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  While no explicit responsive CSS or media queries are applied, the simplicity of the layout suggests that it will adapt well in many environments. However, without dedicated responsive styling, this evaluation is based on an assumption of default browser behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  The component conditionally maps over the array of characters (or filteredCharacters) returned from the API and renders a list, confirming that search results are displayed.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  The code handles API errors by updating the error state and displaying an error message. Although it does not implement React error boundary components for catching rendering errors, the error handling provided meets the basic requirements for API error management. This assessment has a minor uncertainty regarding formal React error boundary usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The Character interface and proper TypeScript types for state and props are defined, ensuring strict typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The implementation continues to load initial data and displays character lists correctly, while enhancing the component with search functionality. The original behavior appears to be preserved.
