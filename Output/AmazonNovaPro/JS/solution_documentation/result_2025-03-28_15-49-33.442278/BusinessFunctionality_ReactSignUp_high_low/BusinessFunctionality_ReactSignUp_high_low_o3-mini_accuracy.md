- **Pass (100%)**: Confirmed that the documentation accurately describes the validation rules for name (3-60 characters), email (valid format), and password (minimum 6 characters).  
  The document explicitly lists these criteria in the "Data Validation Rules and Error Handling" section.

- **Pass (100%)**: Validated that the documentation correctly explains the asynchronous validation for checking existing usernames and emails.  
  As described under both "Asynchronous Validation" and "asyncValidate Function", the document covers the use of asynchronous checks for username and email uniqueness.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verified that the documentation accurately describes the form submission process and API interaction.  
  The documentation outlines the form submission process, including the submission handling steps and calls to APIs like `api.signup`, `api.isName`, and `api.isEmail`.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirmed that the documentation correctly explains the Redux integration for state management.  
  It explicitly mentions the usage of Redux for managing form state and interaction with Redux actions.

  The documentation specifies that the `FormGroup` component is responsible for rendering input fields along with validation messages.

- **Fail (100%)**: Confirmed that the documentation correctly explains the Promise-based architecture for parallel validation checks.  
  Although the documentation mentions a promise-based approach for form submission, it does not clearly describe if the architecture uses promises to perform parallel validation checks. This detail is missing.

- **Pass (100%)**: Validated that the documentation accurately describes the user flow from form completion to successful signup.  
  The user interaction flow—from form display to input, validation, and submission—is comprehensively described.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verified that the documentation accurately explains the error handling during form submission.  
  It details how errors are displayed next to the respective fields and how the system responds when the submission fails.
