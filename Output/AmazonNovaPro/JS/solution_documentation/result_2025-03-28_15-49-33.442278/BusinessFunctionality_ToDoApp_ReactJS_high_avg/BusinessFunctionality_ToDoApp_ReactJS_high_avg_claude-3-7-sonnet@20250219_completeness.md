- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers all main functionality including adding, editing, deleting, and toggling todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about filtering todos by status (all, active, completed)
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the user workflow for creating new todo items

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the clear completed functionality
- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the document describes the toggle all functionality

    The document does not mention the "toggle all" functionality, which would allow users to mark all todos as completed or active with a single action. This is a standard feature in many todo applications but is not covered in the provided documentation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the counter for remaining items

    The document indirectly mentions this in the "Functional Area: Filtering" section and "TodoFooter" component description, though it could be more explicitly described.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the persistent storage of todos
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the UI components and their relationships
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the business objectives addressed by the application
- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes performance and scalability considerations
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes technical constraints and limitations
- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the document covers the pluralization of item/items text based on count

    The document does not mention the pluralization feature for the item count (e.g., "1 item left" vs. "2 items left"). This is a minor but important UI detail that enhances user experience by providing grammatically correct language based on the count of remaining items.
