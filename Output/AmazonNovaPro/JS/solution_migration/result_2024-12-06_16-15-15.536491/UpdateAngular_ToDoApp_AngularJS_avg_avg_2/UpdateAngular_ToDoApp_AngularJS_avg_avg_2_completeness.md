# Evaluation Report

## Step 1: Confirm that the application initializes correctly and loads persisted todos.
**Pass**: The application initializes correctly with the provided `AppModule` and `AppComponent`. The `StoreModule` and `EffectsModule` are correctly configured to manage the state and side effects.

## Step 2: Ensure that the todo list displays correctly and is interactive.
**Pass**: The `TodoComponent` is correctly set up to display the list of todos. The `todo.component.html` file contains the necessary HTML structure to display the todos and make them interactive.

## Step 3: Verify that adding a new todo works correctly.
**Pass**: The `addTodo` method in `TodoComponent` correctly dispatches the `addTodo` action to add a new todo. The form in `todo.component.html` is correctly bound to this method.

## Step 4: Check that editing a todo works correctly.
**Pass**: The `editTodo` and `doneEditing` methods in `TodoComponent` handle the editing of todos correctly. The `todo.component.html` file contains the necessary HTML and bindings to support editing.

## Step 5: Confirm that toggling a todo item completion status works correctly.
**Pass**: The `toggleTodo` method in `TodoComponent` correctly dispatches the `toggleTodo` action to toggle the completion status of a todo. The `todo.component.html` file contains the necessary bindings to support this functionality.

## Step 6: Ensure that removing a todo works correctly.
**Pass**: The `removeTodo` method in `TodoComponent` correctly dispatches the `removeTodo` action to remove a todo. The `todo.component.html` file contains the necessary bindings to support this functionality.

## Step 7: Verify that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works.
**Fail**: The `toggleAll` method is referenced in `todo.component.html`, but it is not implemented in `TodoComponent`. This functionality is incomplete.

## Step 8: Check that the filter functionality (All, Active, Completed) works.
**Fail**: The `setStatus` method is referenced in `todo.component.html`, but it is not implemented in `TodoComponent`. This functionality is incomplete.

## Step 9: Confirm that the "Clear completed" button works correctly.
**Pass**: The `clearCompleted` method in `TodoComponent` correctly dispatches the `removeTodo` action for each completed todo. The `todo.component.html` file contains the necessary bindings to support this functionality.

## Step 10: Ensure that the application is responsive and functions correctly on different screen sizes.
**Pass**: The provided HTML and CSS structure in `todo.component.html` and `todo.component.css` suggest that the application is designed to be responsive.
