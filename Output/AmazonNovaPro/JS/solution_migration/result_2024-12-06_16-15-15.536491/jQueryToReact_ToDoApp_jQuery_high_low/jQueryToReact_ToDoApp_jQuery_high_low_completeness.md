# Evaluation Report

## Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
**Pass**: The input field for creating a new todo is present in `TodoApp.tsx`. The creation occurs when the Enter key is pressed, and the value is taken from the state and dispatched to the store using the `addTodo` action.

## Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
**Fail**: The current implementation does not filter the todo items based on the current filter state. The `TodoList` component displays all todos without considering the filter state.

## Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
**Pass**: The functionality to toggle the completion status of all todos is present in `TodoApp.tsx` with the `handleToggleAll` function, which dispatches the `toggleAll` action.

## Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
**Pass**: Each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted. The `TodoItem` component includes the necessary handlers for toggling (`onToggle`), editing (`onUpdate`), and deleting (`onDestroy`) a todo item.

## Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
**Pass**: The `TodoItem` component handles editing with a double click, submitting with Enter, and resetting with Esc. The `handleDoubleClick`, `handleBlur`, and `handleKeyDown` functions manage these actions.

## Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
**Pass**: The `Footer` component displays the count of active items, includes filter functionality, and has a button to clear completed items, which dispatches the `destroyCompleted` action.

## Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
**Pass**: The `Footer` component includes a button to clear completed TODO items, and it dispatches the `destroyCompleted` action when clicked.
