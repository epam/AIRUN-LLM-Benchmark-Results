# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props
  
  The provided code consistently uses TypeScript throughout, with proper type definitions for components, props, state, and functions. All variables and parameters have explicit type annotations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management
  
  The code includes Redux Toolkit implementation with properly structured slices (pageSlice and usersSlice) using the createSlice API. The store is configured using configureStore from Redux Toolkit.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components
  
  All components in the solution are implemented as functional components using the React.FC type for TypeScript integration.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately
  
  The code demonstrates proper use of hooks, particularly useState and useEffect in the PageForm component for managing local state and side effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource
  
  The solution uses axios for API communication as shown in the api.ts file with proper endpoints defined.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components
  
  The PageForm component implements controlled components correctly, with form elements bound to state values and using onChange handlers to update the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation
  
  React Router is properly implemented in App.tsx with Routes and Route components defining the application's routing structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization
  
  The solution implements internationalization using i18next with the react-i18next integration library, as demonstrated in the i18n.ts file.

- **Fail** (90%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization
  
  The provided code doesn't explicitly show implementation of code splitting using React.lazy() or dynamic imports for performance optimization.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations
  
  The solution includes an example of React.memo usage for the PageForm component to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks
  
  The useEffect hook in the PageForm component includes a proper dependency array with the 'page' variable.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models
  
  Interfaces are properly defined for all data models including PageState, UsersState, and component props like PageFormProps.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state
  
  The code shows basic usage of Redux selectors with useAppSelector in the PageForm component. While it's implemented correctly, more complex selector patterns like memoized selectors with createSelector aren't demonstrated.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations
  
  Action creators are properly implemented using the actions exported from createSlice, such as setPage and setUser.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks
  
  Local storage functionality is correctly implemented in the PageForm component, with proper methods for handling local versions and newer versions detection.
