# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented

    The provided solution only partially implements page management functionality. While the code shows a `handleSavePage` function in the PageForm component, it's merely a placeholder comment (`// Implement save logic`) without actual implementation. There's no code for delete or duplicate functionality at all.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present

    The page type selection functionality is implemented in the PageForm component with a select dropdown and a properly connected handler (`handleTypeChange`) that updates the Redux store.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists

    The solution includes a URL input field and a handler (`handleUrlChange`), but there is no functionality to automatically generate the URL from the title. This feature is completely missing.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented

    The solution defines tags in the pageSlice state, but doesn't implement any UI components or functionality for tag management or autocomplete suggestions.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available

    While the pageSlice includes a "publish" property in its state, the PageForm component doesn't provide UI elements to select publish status options (publish, draft, schedule).

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented

    The pageSlice includes a "scheduleDate" property, but the PageForm component doesn't provide any date picker or related functionality to set a scheduled publishing date.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present

    The solution implements comprehensive local storage version comparison and restoration features. It includes:
    - Detection of newer local versions
    - Options to use local versions or discard them
    - Logic to handle storage and retrieval of form values

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented

    There is no implementation of a notification system for displaying success or error messages in the solution.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present

    The solution doesn't implement any form validation logic for required fields or any other validation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled

    The solution includes a comprehensive API service that covers all the required endpoints using axios, matching the original requirements.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented

    There is no implementation of extras management functionality in the provided solution.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained

    While the API endpoints for revisions are defined in the api.ts file, there is no actual implementation of revision history functionality in the components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components

    The solution properly organizes code into feature folders with a clear separation of concerns:
    - Redux store and slices in appropriate directories
    - Components in their own folder
    - API services separated from UI components
    - Clear separation of business logic from presentation

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved

    The solution sets up the i18next integration with React, but doesn't include actual translation usage in the components. The basic infrastructure is there, but it's not actively used in the UI components.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters

    The routing setup in App.tsx appears to maintain the original URL structure with routes for "/new" and "/:url", though without seeing the complete original Angular code, I'm slightly less confident about whether all URL parameters are preserved.
