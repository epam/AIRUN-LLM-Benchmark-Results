# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props.  
  The answer uses TypeScript throughout (e.g. React.FC, interfaces for state and props) which indicates a strong adherence to TypeScript with type definitions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management.  
  The Redux slices (pageSlice and usersSlice) are implemented using createSlice and configureStore from Redux Toolkit.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components.  
  All components (e.g. PageForm, App) are written as functional components.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately.  
  The answer uses useState and useEffect correctly. Although useCallback and useMemo are not explicitly utilized, the hooks provided cover the needed functionality. The slight confidence decrease is due to the absence of additional hooks that might optimize performance in some cases, but their non-use appears acceptable given the context.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource.  
  The API communication is handled using axios throughout the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components.  
  The PageForm component uses controlled components (input, textarea, select) with onChange handlers and state updates via Redux.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation.  
  The App component uses react-router-domâ€™s Routes and Route to manage navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization.  
  The provided i18n.ts file sets up internationalization using i18next and react-i18next.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization.  
  There is no evidence of dynamic imports (e.g. React.lazy, Suspense) or other code splitting techniques to optimize performance.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations.  
  Although Step 8 mentions the use of React.memo via a code snippet, the main PageForm component (and others) is not actually wrapped with React.memo in the provided code. This discrepancy lowers the confidence slightly, as it remains ambiguous whether the optimization is applied consistently.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks.  
  In the PageForm component, the useEffect hook specifies [page] as its dependency array. While this appears to work for the intended behavior, the usage of window.location.pathname inside the hook is not included in the dependency array. This might be intentional if the pathname is assumed static. Hence, the slight reduction in confidence.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models.  
  Interfaces for PageState, UsersState, and PageFormProps are clearly defined and used.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state.  
  The code uses a custom hook (useAppSelector) to access Redux state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations.  
  The Redux slices include well-defined action creators (e.g., setPage, setUser).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks.  
  The PageForm component correctly integrates local storage handling within a useEffect hook and using event handlers.
