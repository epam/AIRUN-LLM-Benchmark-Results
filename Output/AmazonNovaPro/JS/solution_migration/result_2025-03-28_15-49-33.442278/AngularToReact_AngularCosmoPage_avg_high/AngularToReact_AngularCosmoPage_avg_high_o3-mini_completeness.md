# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
  The provided answer includes handling for updating the page state and saving/restoring a local version but does not explicitly implement full page management functionality such as creating new pages, deleting pages, or duplicating pages.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
  The answer includes a <select> element for choosing the page type with defined options ("type1" and "type2"), which meets the requirement for page type selection.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
  There is no logic implemented to auto-generate a URL from the title. The URL is an independent input field, and no code derives the URL value from the title field.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
  Although the Redux slice includes a tags array, there is no UI or business logic for managing tags or providing autocomplete suggestions.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
  The solution handles a "publish" field in the state but does not provide a UI element (such as radio buttons or a dropdown) to select between the various publishing statuses like publish, draft, or schedule.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
  While the state contains a "scheduleDate" field and there is some handling for it via local storage, there is no UI component that allows the user to set or modify the scheduled publishing date.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
  The component implements a local version comparison by checking local storage against the current page state and provides options to restore or discard the local version.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
  There is no implementation provided for notifying users about success or error events after operations like saving, updating, or deleting the page.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
  The answer does not include form validation logic which is needed to ensure that required fields such as URL and page type are filled out correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
  The answer provides a comprehensive list of API endpoints in the api.ts file, covering various resources such as blocks, content, files, menus, modules, sitemaps, themes, settings, and users.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
  Although API calls for extras (e.g., getContentExtras and getContentRevisionsExtras) are present, there is no implementation detailing how extras are managed within the user interface or business logic.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
  The API endpoints for fetching revision history exist, but there is no accompanying UI or logic to manage or display revision history.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
  The code structure reflects a separation into feature folders (such as page and users slices) and keeps business logic (state management and API calls) separate from UI components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
  Internationalization is set up using i18next, with a dedicated i18n file and proper initialization integrated into the application, thus preserving translation functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
  The routing configuration in App.tsx uses both a specific "/new" route and a dynamic "/:url" route, which maintains the applicationâ€™s URL structure and parameters similar to the original.
