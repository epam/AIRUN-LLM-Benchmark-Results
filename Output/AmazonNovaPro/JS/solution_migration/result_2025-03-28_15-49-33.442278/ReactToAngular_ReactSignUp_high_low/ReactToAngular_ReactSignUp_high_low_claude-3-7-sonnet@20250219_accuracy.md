# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling
  
  The SignupComponent clearly uses Angular's Reactive Forms approach with FormBuilder, FormGroup, and Validators from '@angular/forms'. The form is initialized in the ngOnInit method using the FormBuilder service.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)
  
  The form controls have the following validators:
  - name: Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3), Validators.maxLength(60)
  - email: Validators.required, Validators.email
  - password: Validators.required, Validators.minLength(6)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use
  
  The ValidatorService provides an asyncValidator function that makes HTTP requests to check if the name and email are already in use, using `${environment.apiUrl}/isName/${name}` and `${environment.apiUrl}/isEmail/${email}` endpoints.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched
  
  The FormGroupComponent uses `[ngClass]="{'has-error': hasError, 'has-success': hasSuccess}"` to apply appropriate styling based on validation status, and the component checks if fields are touched before showing validation feedback.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions
  
  The onSubmit method calls the API using HttpClient to post to `${environment.apiUrl}/signup` and dispatches the signupComplete action upon successful signup.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails
  
  The FormGroupComponent includes `<div *ngIf="hasError" class="help-block">{{ errorMessage }}</div>` to display error messages when validation fails.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service
  
  There is no implementation of Angular's Title service in the provided code. The Title service should be imported and used to set the page title, but it's missing from the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management
  
  The component injects Store from '@ngrx/store', and the code includes auth.actions.ts, auth.reducer.ts, and auth.effects.ts, which are referenced in app.module.ts.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress
  
  The submit button has the attribute `[disabled]="submitting"`, and the submitting flag is set to true before form submission and should be set to false in the finalize operator of the HTTP request.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses
  
  The HTTP request uses switchMap for success and catchError for errors. However, there's an issue with the code - it references a 'finalize' operator that is imported but not properly included in the code. This is likely a minor oversight, and the intent is clear.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management
  
  The component follows most Angular best practices with clear separation of concerns, proper lifecycle hooks (ngOnInit), and dependency injection. However, the auth.effects.ts file appears to be cut off, making it hard to fully evaluate.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises
  
  The code consistently uses HttpClient for API calls and properly uses RxJS operators (switchMap, catchError) for handling responses.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements
  
  While there is a mechanism to display error messages via the FormGroupComponent's errorMessage getter, the implementation simply joins all errors with commas. There's no evidence that specific, customized error messages are being displayed as would be required. Additionally, we can't see the full implementation of the error handling from the async validators.
