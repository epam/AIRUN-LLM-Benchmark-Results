# Evaluation Report

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The SignupComponent uses FormBuilder to create a reactive form in ngOnInit, confirming the use of Angularâ€™s Reactive Forms.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The form specified in SignupComponent validates the name with Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3), Validators.maxLength(60); the email with Validators.required, Validators.email; and the password with Validators.required, Validators.minLength(6).

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  The asynchronous validator provided in ValidatorService sends HTTP GET requests to check if the name or email is already in use and returns the corresponding error objects if so.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The FormGroupComponent inspects form control states (touched, invalid, valid) and displays error messages using CSS classes such as "has-error" and "has-success".

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  In onSubmit, after validating the form, an HTTP POST request is made to the signup API endpoint and, on success, dispatches the authActions.signupComplete action via @ngrx/store.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The FormGroupComponent renders a help-block div that displays errors when the field is touched and invalid, ensuring the user sees relevant error messages.

- **Fail (100%)**: Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  There is no evidence in the provided code (neither in the component nor in any module/service) that Angular's Title service is used to set the page title. This functionality is missing.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The module imports StoreModule and EffectsModule, and the SignupComponent dispatches an action from auth.actions. This confirms the use of @ngrx for state management.

- **Pass (90%)**: Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button is bound to the "submitting" variable with [disabled]="submitting". Although the finalize operator is used to reset this flag, it is not imported explicitly in the snippet. However, the intended functionality is present.  
  Explanation: The omission of the explicit import for finalize might cause a runtime error, but as per intent and design, the button disabling mechanism is correctly implemented.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  The API call handles success by dispatching an action and error by capturing errors in the catchError block, which then updates the error object.

- **Pass (95%)**: Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The code separates concerns by using a dedicated service for validation, utilizes Reactive Forms, and manages state with @ngrx. However, a minor improvement could be unsubscribing from statusChanges to prevent potential memory leaks, which is not addressed. This yields a high, but not perfect, confidence level.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The provided code consistently uses Angular's HttpClient for making API calls.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The asynchronous validator returns error objects with messages exactly matching the requirements ("This name is already in use" and "This email is already in use") when the respective validations fail.
