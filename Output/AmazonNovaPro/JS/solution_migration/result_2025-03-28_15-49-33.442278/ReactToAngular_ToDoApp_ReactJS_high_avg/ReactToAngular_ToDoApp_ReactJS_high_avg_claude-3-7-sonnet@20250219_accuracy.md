# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The code uses Angular specifics like NgModule, @Component decorators, and other Angular constructs consistent with Angular 14.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
  
  The code includes proper @ngrx/store implementation with actions, reducers, and selectors.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
  
  There is no implementation of @ngrx/effects in the provided code. The code should include effects for handling side effects like API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
  
  The code includes proper actions (todo.actions.ts), reducers (todo.reducer.ts), and selectors (todo.selectors.ts) for the NgRx store.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
  
  The TodoAppComponent uses the @Component decorator properly.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators
  
  The code does not show proper replacement of React refs with Angular's @ViewChild. For example, the newField reference in the template should be accessed via @ViewChild in the component class.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
  
  The code does not demonstrate the use of @Input and @Output decorators for component communication. There appears to be only one component, but parent-child communication mechanisms aren't evident.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
  
  The TodoService is implemented correctly to handle data operations and business logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
  
  Dependency injection is properly implemented, for example in the TodoAppComponent constructor: `constructor(public todoService: TodoService) {}`.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
  
  There is no mention or implementation of change detection strategies (OnPush) in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
  
  There is no implementation of Angular Router in the provided code. For a complete migration, routing should be included.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code has some issues with Angular style guide conventions, such as using className instead of class in HTML templates and using JSX-like attribute naming (htmlFor instead of for).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
  
  The code uses TypeScript interfaces like ITodo and proper typing throughout the application.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
  
  The HTML template still contains React/JSX-specific attributes like className and htmlFor which should be class and for in Angular templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
  
  React event handlers have been properly replaced with Angular event bindings like (click), (change), etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs
  
  The code does not contain any TODO comments or unfinished sections.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules
  
  There is no implementation of lazy loading for feature modules in the provided code.
