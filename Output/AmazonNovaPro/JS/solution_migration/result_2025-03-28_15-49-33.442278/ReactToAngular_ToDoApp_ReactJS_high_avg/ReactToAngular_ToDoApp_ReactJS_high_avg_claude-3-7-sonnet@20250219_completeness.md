# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items
  
  The provided code has an incomplete template (todo-app.component.html) that gets cut off mid-component. The list rendering appears to be started but not completed properly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented
  
  The code correctly implements the functionality to add new todo items through the `handleNewTodoKeyDown` method in the TodoAppComponent and the `addTodo` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works
  
  The toggle functionality is properly implemented through the `toggleTodo` action and the corresponding reducer logic that flips the 'completed' property.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented
  
  The editing implementation is incomplete. The `edit` method in the TodoAppComponent is empty, and the `save` method exists but the template code for editing is cut off. The underlying store logic for editing exists but the UI implementation is incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented
  
  The delete functionality is properly implemented via the `destroyTodo` action and its corresponding reducer logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented
  
  The 'Mark all as complete' functionality is properly implemented through the `toggleAll` action and the corresponding reducer logic.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works
  
  While the state includes a 'nowShowing' property that could be used for filtering, there's no implementation for changing this filter state or UI components to enable filtering.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items
  
  There is no implementation for a footer component or logic to count and display active items.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items
  
  The 'Clear completed' functionality is implemented via the `clearCompleted` action and its corresponding reducer.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage
  
  There is no implementation for persisting todos to local storage. The code only manages todo items in the NgRx store without any persistence mechanism.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation
  
  There is no routing implementation visible in the provided code to maintain URL structures or navigation.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states
  
  No specific handling for empty states (e.g., no todos) is implemented in the UI.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly
  
  The form submission handling is incomplete as the edit functionality is not fully implemented.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships
  
  The code shows a proper structure with services, components, and state management, but seems to be missing some components (like a footer, filter controls) that would be expected in a complete todo application.

- **Fail** (80%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved
  
  Several key aspects of todo app business logic are missing, including filtering, persistence, and complete editing functionality. Since we don't have the original application code to compare against, it's difficult to verify if all original business logic was preserved.
