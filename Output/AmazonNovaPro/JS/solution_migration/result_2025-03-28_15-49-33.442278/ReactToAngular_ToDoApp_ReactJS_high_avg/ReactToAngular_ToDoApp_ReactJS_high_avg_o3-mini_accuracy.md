# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The provided answer starts with creating an Angular project using CLI commands. Although it does not explicitly specify Angular version 14.x, the context of “Angular 14.x migration” is assumed.  
   
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The answer includes the installation of @ngrx/store and demonstrates actions, reducers, and selectors in multiple files.  

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  None of the provided code shows any implementation of @ngrx/effects for side effects management.  

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  The answer defines actions (in actions/todo.actions.ts), reducers (in reducers/todo.reducer.ts), and selectors (in selectors/todo.selectors.ts) correctly.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  The main component (TodoAppComponent) is decorated with @Component. Although there is no demonstration of @Input or @Output, the usage of @Component is correct and sufficient for a standalone component.  

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  While the HTML template uses a template reference variable (#newField), there is no use of Angular’s @ViewChild to access the element programmatically, which is what the evaluation step requires.  

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  The presented code is mostly a single-component example that leverages a service for state management. There is no explicit parent–child communication using @Input() or @Output(), but since the design does not require such communication for this example, it is acceptable. However, a more complex application might be expected to show these decorators.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  The TodoService is implemented and handles dispatching store actions, which is appropriate for maintaining business logic and data handling.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  Dependency injection is used in the service (injecting the Store) and in the component (injecting TodoService) as required.  

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  The code does not apply any explicit change detection strategies (e.g., ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush). Although the default change detection might be acceptable for simple cases, the evaluation step calls for an explicit check where it is appropriate.  
  (The slight reduction to 90% reflects uncertainty whether the default strategy would be considered “appropriate” in this context.)  

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  There is no implementation or mention of Angular Router in the answer.  

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  Several HTML attributes are incorrectly used (e.g., "className" instead of "class" and "htmlFor" instead of "for"), which violates Angular’s recommended conventions.  

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  Although an ITodo interface is used in parts of the code, some functions (for example, in the TodoService) accept parameters typed as “any” instead of strongly-typed interfaces. This results in a less-than-ideal TypeScript implementation.  
  (The 90% confidence reflects that while many types are properly used, there are notable lapses.)  

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  The React component JSX has been converted into an Angular HTML template. However, note that the HTML snippet appears truncated, which leaves some ambiguity about the completeness of the template conversion.  

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  The code replaces React event handler props (e.g., onKeyDown, onChange) with Angular event bindings, such as (keydown) and (change).  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  There are comment placeholders such as “// Handle edit in template” and “// Handle cancel in template,” but no explicit “TODO” comments are present in the provided code.  

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  Although a feature module (todo) is generated, the answer does not demonstrate lazy loading of this module. Lazy loading is not implemented in the routing configuration.
