# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The provided Angular template includes an *ngFor loop that iterates over the todos list and displays each item.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The component defines a handleNewTodoKeyDown method that listens for an Enter key event and calls the TodoService.addToDo function, correctly adding new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  The code includes a toggle method (bound to a checkbox change event) that inverts the completed status of a todo, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  While there is an edit method stub and a save method linked to the blur event on the editing input, the editing workflow is incomplete. The edit method is only commented as “Handle edit in template,” and the (keydown) handler in the edit input is truncated. This does not fully implement the editing functionality.  
  Explanation: The incomplete implementation and truncated HTML for handling keydown events leave uncertainty about how editing is fully supported in the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  The destroy method and corresponding dispatch call for deleting a todo are implemented in both the service and the component, ensuring deletion capability.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  A checkbox with id "toggle-all" is present in the template, and its change event triggers the toggleAll method, which updates all todos’ completion status.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  Although the state contains a nowShowing property and there is a corresponding selector, the component template does not include any logic or UI elements to filter the displayed todos according to these categories.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  There is no footer component or template snippet provided that displays the active todo count, so this requirement is not met.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The TodoService includes a clearCompleted method and a corresponding action exists, but the provided template does not show a UI element (e.g., a button) for triggering this functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  No logic for saving or retrieving todos from local storage is included in the answer.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  There is no routing module or URL configuration provided, so it is unclear whether the original navigation structure is preserved.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  The answer does not include any specific implementation or UI handling for cases when there are no todos (empty state).

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  The new-todo input uses a keydown event listener to detect an Enter key press for submission. While this captures the intent, there is no explicit form element or submit event handling, which might be expected in a conventional form submission scenario.  
  Explanation: The approach works but deviates from a traditional form submit, causing a slight uncertainty regarding its completeness in typical Angular form handling.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The structure of having a TodoAppComponent that interacts with TodoService and uses @ngrx/store for state management shows a clear separation of concerns. However, the provided code is incomplete in parts (such as the editing functionality), which introduces minor uncertainty in fully assessing component interactions.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  Although the actions, reducers, and basic todo operations are implemented, key aspects such as filtering, complete editing functionality, local storage persistence, and URL navigation are missing. This suggests that not all business logic from the original application has been preserved.
