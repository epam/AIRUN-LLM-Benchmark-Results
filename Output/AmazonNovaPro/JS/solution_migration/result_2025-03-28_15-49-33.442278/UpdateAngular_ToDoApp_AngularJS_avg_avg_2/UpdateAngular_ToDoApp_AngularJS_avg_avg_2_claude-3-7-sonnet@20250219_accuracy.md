# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework

    The code appears to use Angular syntax consistent with modern Angular (which includes version 14.x), including imports from '@angular/core', component decorators, and NgModule. However, there is no explicit version number mentioned in the code, so I cannot verify with 100% certainty that it specifically uses Angular 14.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS

    The code clearly uses ES modules with import/export statements throughout, which is the standard module system in modern Angular. There is no sign of RequireJS being used.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management

    The code includes imports from '@ngrx/store', defines a reducer (todoReducer), and implements store integration in the app.module.ts with `StoreModule.forRoot({ todos: todoReducer })`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects

    The code includes `EffectsModule.forRoot([TodoEffects])` in the app.module.ts and defines TodoEffects class that implements side effects for saving todos to localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management

    The code includes well-defined actions (addTodo, removeTodo, toggleTodo, markAll, clearCompleted), a reducer that handles these actions, and effects for persistence. However, the code for selectors appears to be referenced but not fully shown in the snippet (e.g., `fromTodo.getTodos`).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator

    The TodoEffects class uses the @Injectable() decorator as required for services in Angular.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service

    localStorage is used for data persistence in the TodoEffects service, which saves todos to 'todos-angular' key.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators

    Both AppComponent and TodoComponent use proper @Component decorators with the required metadata (selector, templateUrl, styleUrls).

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators

    The code mentions TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective in the module declarations, and they are referenced in the template, but their implementation with @Directive decorators is not explicitly shown in the provided code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)

    The template uses proper Angular syntax with *ngFor, *ngIf directives throughout.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))

    Event binding is correctly implemented with Angular syntax like (click), (submit), (dblclick), (blur).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])

    Property binding is correctly implemented with Angular syntax like [class.completed], [class.editing], [todoEscape].

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed

    While the TodoComponent implements ngOnInit(), the provided code appears to be incomplete. The last part of the TodoComponent.ts file shows the beginning of an addTodo method but is cut off, suggesting there might be more code including possibly additional lifecycle hooks that we cannot see.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models

    TypeScript interfaces are used for data models, such as the Todo interface and State interface in the todo.reducer.ts file.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services

    Dependency injection is correctly implemented in both components and services, using constructor parameter syntax (e.g., `constructor(private store: Store<fromTodo.State>, private route: ActivatedRoute)`).

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions

    The code generally follows Angular style guide conventions with proper naming (camelCase for methods, PascalCase for classes), organization into feature modules, and separation of concerns. However, without seeing the complete codebase, I cannot
