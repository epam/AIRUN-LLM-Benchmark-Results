# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list

    The answer is incomplete. It provides a partial implementation of the `TodoComponent` class that would display the todo list, but the code is cut off in the middle of the `addTodo` method. The HTML template for displaying the todo list is present, but without the complete component implementation, we cannot verify this requirement is fully met.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos

    While the HTML template includes an input field for adding new todos and there's a partial implementation of the `addTodo` method in the component class, the code is cut off before the method implementation is completed. Therefore, we cannot confirm this requirement is fully met.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos

    The HTML template includes the editing interface and there's evidence of `editTodo` and `doneEditing` methods in the component, but since the component implementation is incomplete, we cannot verify this requirement is fully met.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos

    The HTML template includes filter links and there's reference to a filter in the component class, but since the complete implementation is missing, we cannot confirm this requirement is fully met.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics

    The HTML template includes elements for displaying count statistics, but without the complete component implementation, we cannot verify this requirement is fully met.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos

    The `addTodo` method in the component class is cut off before its implementation is completed, so we cannot confirm this functionality is properly implemented.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos

    While there are references to `editTodo` and `doneEditing` methods in the template, the component class implementation is incomplete, so we cannot verify this functionality is properly implemented.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos

    The HTML template includes a delete button and there's a reference to a `removeTodo` method, but since the component implementation is incomplete, we cannot confirm this functionality is properly implemented.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed

    The HTML template includes a checkbox for marking todos as completed, but without the complete component implementation, we cannot verify this functionality is properly implemented.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)

    The HTML template includes filter links, but without the complete implementation of the filtering logic, we cannot confirm this functionality is properly implemented.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete

    The HTML template includes a "toggle-all" checkbox and there's a reference to a `markAll` method, but without the complete component implementation, we cannot verify this functionality is properly implemented.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos

    The HTML template includes a "clear completed" button and there's a reference to a `clearDoneTodos` method, but without the complete component implementation, we cannot confirm this functionality is properly implemented.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos

    The HTML template includes an element for displaying the count of remaining todos, but without the complete component implementation, we cannot verify this functionality is properly implemented.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage

    The code includes mechanisms for persisting todos in localStorage through the `TodoEffects` class, which appears to save todos to localStorage whenever a todo-related action is dispatched. However, without seeing the complete implementation and integration, we cannot be 100% confident.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization

    The `initialState` in the todo reducer attempts to load todos from localStorage on initialization. However, without seeing the complete application flow, we cannot be 100% confident that this works correctly.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing

    While there's a reference to a `todoEscape` directive in the HTML template, without seeing the complete implementation of this directive and how it's integrated with the component, we cannot confirm
