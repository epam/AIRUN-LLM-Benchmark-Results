# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The answer instructs to create a new Angular project and consistently uses Angular conventions. Although it does not explicitly specify version “14.x” in the code or package.json, the instructions state “Angular 14.x” as a migration target; thus, we assume that the provided code aligns with Angular 14 practices.  
  Explanation: Uncertainty arises because the exact version isn’t explicitly declared.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
  The code makes use of ES module syntax with “import” statements throughout, indicating the removal of RequireJS.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
  The application imports StoreModule from @ngrx/store in app.module.ts and defines a todoReducer, which confirms that state management via @ngrx/store is implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
  The answer shows EffectsModule.forRoot that includes TodoEffects, and the TodoEffects class is decorated appropriately with @Injectable. This confirms side effect management with @ngrx/effects.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
  While actions, reducers, and effects are defined, the code expects to select todos via a selector (i.e. fromTodo.getTodos) in TodoComponent. However, no selector is provided in the snippets. This omission leads to a failure of this requirement.  
  Explanation: The absence of a clearly defined selector means not all aspects of the state management pattern are fully implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
  The TodoEffects class uses the @Injectable decorator, and dependency injection is used in constructors appropriately. Although there is no separate service for data persistence, the provided injectable class meets the requirement.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
  LocalStorage is employed in the code (within the reducer’s initial state and in the TodoEffects for saving todos), but it is not encapsulated inside an Angular service. Instead, it is used directly.  
  Explanation: Since the evaluation step explicitly calls for data persistence handling via a dedicated service, the current implementation does not fully satisfy this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
  Both AppComponent and TodoComponent correctly implement the @Component decorator with appropriate properties, confirming correct usage.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
  The Angular module declares two directives (TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective). Although the directive implementations are not shown, their inclusion in the module suggests that they are defined with the correct @Directive decorator.  
  Explanation: Full verification isn’t possible without seeing the directive definitions; however, their declaration implies proper usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
  The component template makes use of *ngIf and *ngFor, among other Angular template syntaxes, confirming compliance with the expected syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
  Event bindings like (click) and (submit) are used consistently throughout the templates, adhering to Angular syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
  The template demonstrates proper property binding (e.g., [class.completed]="todo.completed"), validating this aspect.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
  The TodoComponent implements ngOnInit to handle initialization logic, meeting Angular lifecycle hook requirements.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
  Interfaces are defined for both Todo and State in the todo.reducer.ts file, employing TypeScript features appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
  Dependency injection is effectively used in the constructors of both TodoComponent and TodoEffects, indicating proper implementation.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code is largely well-organized and uses standard Angular patterns. Minor deviations (such as directly handling localStorage rather than encapsulating it in a service) might be noted, but overall the style is consistent.  
  Explanation: Some minor design practices could be improved to fully align with style guidelines.

- **Pass** (70%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
  While no runtime errors or warnings are evident from the static review of the code, this evaluation is based solely on inspection rather than actual runtime testing.  
  Explanation: The inability to run the code introduces some uncertainty.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
  The application makes proper use of TypeScript features including type annotations, interfaces, and strict typing in its components and reducers.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
  There are no TODO comments or commented-out blocks of code present in the provided snippets.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design  
  The TodoComponent handles presentation as well as some state and event logic. While common in small to moderate applications, splitting responsibilities further (for example, using container/presenter components or dedicated services) might be more ideal.  
  Explanation: Given the simplicity of the todo application, it is acceptable, though there is room for improvement.
