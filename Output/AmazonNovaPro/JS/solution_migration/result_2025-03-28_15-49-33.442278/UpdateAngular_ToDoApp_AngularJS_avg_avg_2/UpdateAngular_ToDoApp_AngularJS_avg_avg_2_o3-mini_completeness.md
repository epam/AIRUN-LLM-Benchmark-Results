# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list  
  The provided code includes a component (todo/todo.component) and its template contains a list structure (using *ngFor) rendered within a <ul> element.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos  
  The template shows an input element in a form with a submit event bound to addTodo($event), indicating the presence of functionality to add todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos  
  The code shows methods such as editTodo(todo) and doneEditing(todo), and includes an editing <form> input with associated directives for handling edit operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos  
  There is evidence of a filtering mechanism in the template via a custom pipe (todoFilter) and links that update the status filter based on URL changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics  
  The template contains a section displaying the count ({{remainingCount}} item(s) left), fulfilling the requirement.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos  
  While the addTodo(event: Event) method is referenced and the UI form is provided, the complete implementation of addTodo is truncated in the snippet. It is assumed that further code implements the addition; hence, a slight reservation is noted.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos  
  With the presence of editTodo(todo) and doneEditing(todo) methods and the corresponding UI elements, the editing functionality is implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos  
  The template provides a delete button (<button class="destroy" (click)="removeTodo(i)">) which connects to a removeTodo method, confirming deletion support.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed  
  Each todo item includes a checkbox bound to the todoâ€™s completed property, which toggles its state, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)  
  The provided anchors for All, Active, and Completed filters, together with the route subscription that updates the statusFilter, indicate the filtering functionality is present.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete  
  The presence of the "toggle-all" checkbox and the corresponding markAll(allChecked) method confirms this functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos  
  The UI contains a "clear-completed" button triggering clearDoneTodos(), which implies that there is a mechanism to remove completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos  
  The display of {{remainingCount}} in the footer explicitly shows the count of active todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage  
  The todoReducer initializes its state by reading from localStorage, and the TodoEffects include a side effect that writes updates to localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization  
  The initialState uses localStorage.getItem to load saved todos, ensuring that persisted data is loaded during initialization.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing  
  The input field in the editing form uses the directive [todoEscape]="revertEditing(todo)", which is intended to handle the escape key functionality to cancel editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo  
  The directive todoFocus is applied to the editing input element, indicating that auto-focusing when editing is implemented.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original  
  The HTML structure and CSS class names (e.g., todoapp, header, main, footer) closely mirror those of the standard TodoMVC layout. However, without a rendered view, the aesthetic similarity is assumed based on the markup.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately  
  There is no explicit check or handling shown in the available code for empty todo titles in the addTodo method. This functionality appears to be missing or incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter  
  The component subscribes to the route URL and updates the statusFilter accordingly. Additionally, the anchor links use href with hash-based URLs, which supports updating the URL based on the selected filter.
