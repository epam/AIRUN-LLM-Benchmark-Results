# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that all React imports use React 18.x compatible syntax

    The code includes React 18 in the package.json (`"react": "^18.0.0"`), but the imports are incomplete. The answer shows React DOM import using the new createRoot API: `import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';` which is correct for React 18, but it doesn't show the actual root creation and rendering using `createRoot` which is essential for React 18 migration. The complete root creation and rendering is missing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all components use functional component syntax with hooks instead of class components

    The App component is defined as a functional component with hooks: `const App: React.FC = () => {...}`. The TodoItem and TodoFooter are also referenced as components, though not fully shown.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Redux Toolkit's createSlice is used for state management

    Redux Toolkit is properly implemented with createSlice in todoSlice.ts. The code includes proper slice definition with initial state, reducers, and actions exported from the slice.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for all props, state, and Redux store

    TypeScript interfaces are defined appropriately, including Todo interface, TodoState interface, and RootState and AppDispatch types for Redux.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses immutable state updates in reducers

    The reducers in todoSlice.ts use immutable updates through Redux Toolkit's createSlice, which internally uses Immer for immutable updates. Examples include the array operations like map, filter, and the modification of todo items.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that nanoid is used for ID generation instead of custom UUID implementation

    Nanoid is properly imported and used for ID generation through the Utils class: `import { nanoid } from 'nanoid';` and `public static uuid(): string { return nanoid(32); }`.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the application uses React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate

    There is no evidence of React.memo being used for component optimization in the provided code. The TodoItem component, which would typically benefit from memoization, does not show any implementation of React.memo.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that useCallback is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders

    The event handlers in App.tsx are not wrapped with useCallback, which would be expected for optimizing performance in a modern React application. Functions like handleToggle, handleDestroy, etc., should use useCallback.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage handling is implemented in a modern way

    The Utils class provides a store method for localStorage handling that handles both saving and retrieving data with proper JSON serialization/deserialization.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows consistent naming conventions throughout the application

    The code maintains consistent naming conventions with camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for components and classes, and SCREAMING_CASE for constants.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that proper error handling is implemented where necessary

    There is no visible error handling for localStorage operations or any potential API calls. The store method in Utils should include try/catch blocks for handling JSON parsing errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware

    The Redux store is configured correctly using configureStore from @reduxjs/toolkit, which automatically sets up Redux DevTools extension and adds thunk middleware.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that React.lazy is used for code splitting where appropriate

    There is no evidence of React.lazy being used for code splitting in the provided code, which would be expected in a modern React application for performance optimization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the codebase has no TODOs remaining

    There are no TODO comments visible in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the Redux Provider wraps the application entry point

    While the Redux Provider component is imported and referenced, the actual implementation showing the Provider wrapping the application is incomplete. The code shows `import { Provider } from 'react-redux';` but doesn't show the Provider wrapping the application root.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure strict TypeScript type checking is implemented throughout the application

    There is no evidence of strict TypeScript configuration (e.g., tsconfig
