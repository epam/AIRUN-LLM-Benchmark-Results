# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed

    The provided code appears to include functionality for adding new todos when the Enter key is pressed in the `handleNewTodoKeyDown` function. However, the App component is incomplete. The code cuts off in the middle of the `return` statement in the App component, missing crucial parts that would render the application. Therefore, we cannot verify that this functionality works as intended.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter

    While the code includes logic for filtering todos based on the current filter, the App component's render function is incomplete and doesn't show the complete implementation for displaying filtered todos. The todoItems array is populated, but the JSX that would render it is cut off.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos

    The code includes a `handleToggleAll` function, which dispatches a `toggleAll` action. However, the UI component that would use this functionality is not fully shown in the implementation as the App component is incomplete.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted

    The code defines functions for these operations (`handleToggle`, `handleEdit`, `handleDestroy`), but we cannot verify they are properly connected to UI elements because the App component is incomplete.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode

    The implementation includes a `handleEdit` function that sets an editing state, but the UI implementation that would enable double-clicking to trigger edit mode is not visible in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo

    While there is a `handleSave` function that would be responsible for saving an edited todo, the complete TodoItem component implementation is missing, so we cannot verify that pressing Enter submits the edit.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value

    The code includes a `handleCancel` function, but the implementation that would connect this to the Escape key press is not visible in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items

    The code calculates `activeTodoCount`, but the implementation of TodoFooter and how it displays this count is not fully visible in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)

    The code defines constants for different filters and sets up routes, but the complete implementation of the filter UI is not visible as the App component is incomplete.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos

    The code includes a `handleClearCompleted` function, but the UI element that would use this functionality is not visible in the provided code.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence

    The code appears to use localStorage for todo persistence through the `Utils.store` method which is called in the various reducer actions. However, without seeing the complete application in action, there's a small uncertainty about whether this is properly implemented throughout the application.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state

    While there's some conditional rendering in the incomplete App component (e.g., `{todos.length > 0 && (...`), the complete implementation that would show or hide various UI elements is not visible.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count

    The Utils class includes a `pluralize` method, but we cannot see how this is used in the UI as the App component is incomplete.

- **Pass** (80%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components

    The code shows evidence of component composition with TodoItem and TodoFooter components. However, without seeing the complete implementation of these components, there's uncertainty about how well-focused they are.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality

    The provided code shows a clear organization by functionality, with separate files for utilities, Redux store, todo slice, and components.
