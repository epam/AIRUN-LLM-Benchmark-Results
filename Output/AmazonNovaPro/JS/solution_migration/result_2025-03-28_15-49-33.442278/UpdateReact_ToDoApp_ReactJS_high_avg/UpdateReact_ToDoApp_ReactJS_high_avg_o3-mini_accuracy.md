# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all React imports use React 18.x compatible syntax  
  The code uses "import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';", which is compatible with React 18.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all components use functional component syntax with hooks instead of class components  
  All components, including App, are defined as functional components and use hooks such as useState and useEffect.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Redux Toolkit's createSlice is used for state management  
  The file todoSlice.ts uses createSlice from Redux Toolkit to define reducers and actions.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for all props, state, and Redux store  
  Interfaces for Todo and TodoState are defined and the store has associated types (RootState, AppDispatch). However, not all component props (e.g., in TodoItem or TodoFooter) are shown so there is minor uncertainty.  
  (Reason: Some components’ prop types are not visible in the sample code.)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses immutable state updates in reducers  
  Although the reducers appear to mutate state, Redux Toolkit’s Immer integration ensures immutable updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that nanoid is used for ID generation instead of custom UUID implementation  
  The Utils class calls nanoid(32) for generating unique IDs.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the application uses React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate  
  There is no evidence of React.memo being used in the provided component code, which could help prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that useCallback is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders  
  The event handler functions in the App component (e.g., handleNewTodoKeyDown, handleToggleAll) are not wrapped in useCallback. 

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage handling is implemented in a modern way  
  The Utils.store method appropriately handles saving to and retrieving from localStorage using JSON serialization.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows consistent naming conventions throughout the application  
  The code consistently uses camelCase for functions/variables and PascalCase for components.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that proper error handling is implemented where necessary  
  There is no try/catch or error fallback implemented for potential issues (e.g., JSON parsing errors when reading localStorage).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware  
  The store is configured using Redux Toolkit’s configureStore, which automatically applies the recommended middleware.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that React.lazy is used for code splitting where appropriate  
  There is no usage of React.lazy or Suspense in the code, missing an opportunity for code splitting and performance optimization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the codebase has no TODOs remaining  
  There are no TODO comments present in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the Redux Provider wraps the application entry point  
  Although the Provider is imported, there is no explicit evidence that the Redux Provider wraps the entire application (e.g., in index.tsx or main.tsx), which is essential to connect the store to the app.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure strict TypeScript type checking is implemented throughout the application  
  While TypeScript is used and types are defined, there is no indication of strict type checking (e.g., the absence of a tsconfig.json with strict settings or explicit usage of strict mode) in the provided code.
