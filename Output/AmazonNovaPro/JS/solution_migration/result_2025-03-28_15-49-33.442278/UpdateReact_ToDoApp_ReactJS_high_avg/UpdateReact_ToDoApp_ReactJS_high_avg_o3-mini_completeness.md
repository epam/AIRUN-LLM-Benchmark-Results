# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The code implements a handler (handleNewTodoKeyDown) that checks for the Enter key and, if pressed, dispatches an action to add a new todo. This clearly demonstrates the required functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The code filters todos based on the current filter state (ALL_TODOS, ACTIVE_TODOS, COMPLETED_TODOS) before mapping them into TodoItem components. This meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  A function named handleToggleAll and a corresponding Redux action (toggleAll) are provided. However, while the function exists, the snippet does not show the UI element (such as a checkbox) explicitly tied to this functionality. It is presumed to be integrated elsewhere in the application.  
  Explanation: The functionality is defined but its UI trigger is not visible within the provided code snippet.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  The TodoItem component is used with onToggle, onDestroy, and onEdit handlers, and corresponding Redux actions (toggleTodo, destroyTodo, saveTodo) are defined in the todoSlice. This confirms proper support for item-level interactions.

- **Pass** (80%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  The App passes an onEdit callback to TodoItem that sets the editing state. Although we do not see the explicit double-click implementation (which is likely handled within the TodoItem component), it is a reasonable assumption that double-clicking triggers the onEdit event.  
  Explanation: Since the TodoItem component’s internal implementation is not provided, there is some uncertainty regarding the exact mechanism.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  The code includes a handleSave function to dispatch a saveTodo action when an edited todo is submitted. This functionality is expected to be bound to an Enter key event within the editing component (likely inside TodoItem).  
  Explanation: The explicit event handling for the Enter key during editing isn’t shown in the snippet provided but is likely embedded within the TodoItem component.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  While a handleCancel function is defined that clears the editing state, there is no explicit implementation shown for capturing the Escape key press to trigger this cancellation in the provided code.  
  Explanation: Without any code demonstrating Escape key handling, the requirement is not conclusively met.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  The activeTodoCount is computed in the App component, and the TodoFooter component is imported, which presumably uses this count to display the active items.  
  Explanation: The direct rendering of the count isn’t shown, but the logical foundation is present.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The application’s routing (paths for '/', '/active', and '/completed') and the inclusion of the TodoFooter component suggest that filter functionality is implemented.  
  Explanation: The detailed rendering of filter buttons is not present in the snippet, but overall design indicates they are in place.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  A clearCompleted handler is defined and dispatched when invoked. Although the button element is not explicitly shown within the provided code snippet, it is expected to be part of the TodoFooter component.  
  Explanation: The integration is assumed based on the available handler.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  The todoSlice uses the Utils.store method to read from and write to localStorage whenever todos are modified. This meets the persistence requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  Conditional rendering is demonstrated by checking if todos.length > 0 before displaying the main section, ensuring UI elements appear only when appropriate.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  The Utils.pluralize function is defined to handle pluralization based on the count. Although its usage is not explicitly shown within the UI code snippet, its presence indicates attention to this detail.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The application is broken into multiple components (TodoItem, TodoFooter, etc.), and concerns like state management, utility functions, and routing are separated into different files, confirming good component composition.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  Files such as package.json, utils.ts, store.ts, todoSlice.ts, and App.tsx are organized in a modular fashion, enhancing maintainability and separation of concerns.
