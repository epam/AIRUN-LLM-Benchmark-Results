# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration
  
  The code clearly indicates the use of Create React App with TypeScript template through the command shown: `npx create-react-app virtual-piano --template typescript`. The imports and component syntax with TypeScript annotations (e.g., `const App: React.FC = () => {`) confirm proper TypeScript configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure
  
  The code properly defines a TypeScript interface for the sound mapping structure:
  ```typescript
  interface SoundMap {
    [key: string]: HTMLAudioElement;
  }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks
  
  The code implements the App component as a functional component using React hooks:
  ```typescript
  const App: React.FC = () => {
    const [played, setPlayed] = useState<string[]>([]);
    const [isLetters, setIsLetters] = useState(false);
    const fullscreenRef = useRef<HTMLButtonElement>(null);
    // ...
  }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)
  
  The code makes appropriate use of React hooks for state management:
  - `useState` for tracking played notes and UI state: `useState<string[]>([])` and `useState(false)`
  - `useEffect` for setting up and cleaning up event listeners
  - `useRef` for accessing DOM elements

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels
  
  Keyboard event handlers are implemented at the document level inside a useEffect hook, which is appropriate for handling keyboard events application-wide:
  ```typescript
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleKeyDown = (event: KeyboardEvent) => play(event);
    const handleKeyUp = (event: KeyboardEvent) => resetActive(event);
    
    document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
    document.addEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp);
    
    return () => {
      document.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
      document.removeEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp);
    };
  }, []);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events
  
  Mouse interactions are properly implemented using React synthetic events:
  ```typescript
  onMouseDown={play} 
  onMouseUp={resetActive} 
  onMouseOut={resetActive}
  onMouseMove={(e: React.MouseEvent) => e.buttons === 1 && play(e)}
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment
  
  Audio resources are properly handled using the `process.env.PUBLIC_URL` pattern to ensure correct path resolution in the React environment:
  ```typescript
  c: new Audio(`${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/assets/audio/a.mp3`),
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility
  
  The fullscreen functionality is implemented using React patterns with `useRef` and `useEffect`:
  ```typescript
  const fullscreenRef = useRef<HTMLButtonElement>(null);
  
  const fullscreen = () => {
    if (!document.fullscreenElement) {
      document.documentElement.requestFullscreen();
    } else {
      document.exitFullscreen();
    }
  };
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const fullscreenButton = fullscreenRef.current;
    if (fullscreenButton) {
      fullscreenButton.addEventListener('click', fullscreen);
      return () => {
        fullscreenButton.removeEventListener('click', fullscreen);
      };
    }
  }, []);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns
  
  Conditional class application is implemented using React patterns with template literals and conditional expressions:
  ```typescript
  <button className={`btn btn-notes ${!isLetters ? 'btn-active' :
