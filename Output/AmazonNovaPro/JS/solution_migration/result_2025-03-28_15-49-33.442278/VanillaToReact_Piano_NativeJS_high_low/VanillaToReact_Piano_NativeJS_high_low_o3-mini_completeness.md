# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title "Virtual Piano".  
  The code includes a header element with a h1 tag containing "Virtual Piano", which meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with "Notes" and "Letters" toggle buttons.  
  The JSX contains a div with class "btn-container" and two buttons labeled "Notes" and "Letters", with proper active state logic.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys).  
  The implementation uses array mapping with destructuring on string literals (e.g. ['D-c', 'F-d', …]). This pattern splits each string into individual characters rather than correctly separating the letter from the note. For instance, for "D-c", destructuring yields the first character "D" and the second character "-" (instead of "c"), which likely causes incorrect rendering of piano key data.  
  (Confidence not 100% because it might be an oversight or pseudo-code, but the error is evident from the destructuring approach.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes.  
  Each rendered piano key div includes both a data-letter and a data-note attribute. Despite the mapping issue noted in Step 3, the attributes are present.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked.  
  The play() function retrieves a note’s audio from a soundMapper. However, the mapping shows inconsistencies (for example, the key "c" is mapped to "a.mp3", which may not be correct). Additionally, due to the potential issue in correctly determining the note from the mapped array in Step 3, the wrong audio files might be triggered.  
  (Confidence less than 100% as the intent is clear but the mapping seems off.)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed).  
  The play() function adds the class "piano-key-active" and the resetActive() function removes it, fulfilling the highlighting requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes.  
  The code adds window event listeners for keydown and keyup events—using the event key to locate keys and trigger sound playback—which meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked.  
  The toggle function (change) correctly updates the state (isLetters) and conditionally applies a class on the piano container, allowing a visual switch between notes and letters.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes.  
  The fullscreen functionality is implemented using a ref on the fullscreen button. It checks the document’s fullscreen state and appropriately requests or exits fullscreen mode.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly.  
  The state tracking uses the "played" state array which is updated in a non-functional way (using setPlayed([...played, note])). This may lead to race conditions or stale state when multiple keys are pressed in rapid succession. A functional update approach would be safer for handling multiple simultaneous events.  
  (Confidence is less than 100% because while the code intends to handle simultaneous keys, the implementation might lead to missed updates.)

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys.  
  The onMouseMove handler checks if the mouse button is pressed (e.buttons === 1) and calls the play function, which provides basic drag functionality.  
  (Confidence is 90% because while the approach is valid, potential state update issues similar to keyboard input could occur.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information.  
  The footer is present in the JSX with a div displaying "2020," fulfilling the requirement.
