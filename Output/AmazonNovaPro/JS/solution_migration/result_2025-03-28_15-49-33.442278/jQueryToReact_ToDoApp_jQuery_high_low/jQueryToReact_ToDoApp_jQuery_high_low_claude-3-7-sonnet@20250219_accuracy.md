# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18.x
  
  The provided code indicates React is being used, but there's no explicit version mentioned in the submitted code. The setup instruction uses Create React App with TypeScript template, but this doesn't specifically confirm React 18.x is being used. Additionally, there's no package.json file or React import statements that would verify the React version.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript for type safety
  
  The code clearly uses TypeScript throughout. This is evident from the file extensions (.ts, .tsx), explicit type definitions (interfaces), type annotations, and TypeScript-specific imports.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for state management
  
  The code properly uses Redux Toolkit with createSlice. This is demonstrated in the todoSlice.ts file where createSlice is imported from '@reduxjs/toolkit' and used to define the todo slice with reducers.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm nanoid is used for generating unique IDs
  
  Nanoid is correctly imported and used in the todoSlice.ts file for generating unique IDs for new todos:
  ```typescript
  import { nanoid } from 'nanoid';
  // ...
  state.todos.push({ id: nanoid(), title: action.payload, completed: false });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code uses functional components with hooks instead of class components
  
  All components in the code are functional components using React hooks. For example, in TodoItem.tsx, useState hook is used for local state management, and custom hooks like useAppDispatch are used for Redux interactions.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure the application maintains the same routing functionality with proper route handling
  
  The code includes some routing-related elements (like `<a href="#/all">All</a>` in TodoFooter), but there's no complete implementation of routing. The filtering functionality appears to be partially implemented in the Redux slice, but there's no connection between the UI links and the filter state. Additionally, the code is incomplete - the TodoFooter component isn't properly closed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Redux store is properly configured with appropriate slices
  
  The Redux store is properly configured in store.ts using configureStore from Redux Toolkit and includes the todo reducer.

- **Fail** (80%): Confirm the Redux provider is set up in the application entry point
  
  The submitted code doesn't include the index.tsx or App.tsx files that would show the Redux Provider being set up at the application entry point. This is a critical part of a Redux application.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for all data structures
  
  The code defines proper TypeScript interfaces for the Todo data structure and other types. The RootState and AppDispatch types are also exported from the store for type safety.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the code follows React best practices for component composition
  
  The components are well-structured and follow React best practices, with proper separation of concerns. However, the code is incomplete (missing some components and the TodoFooter component isn't properly closed), so a full assessment is difficult.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles keyboard events properly
  
  The TodoItem component properly handles keyboard events:
  ```typescript
  onKeyDown={(e) => {
    if (e.key === 'Enter') handleEditBlur();
    if (e.key === 'Escape') {
      setTitle(todo.title);
      setEditing(false);
    }
  }}
  ```

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application maintains local storage persistence if implemented
  
  The code doesn't include any local storage implementation for persisting todos between page reloads.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  There's at least one obvious error in the code - the TodoFooter component isn't properly closed with a closing tag. Additionally, there's a reference to useAppSelector and useAppDispatch hooks that are imported from '../../app/hooks', but this file is not included in the submission.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application implements proper error handling
  
  The code doesn't include any error handling mechanisms, try/catch blocks, or error
