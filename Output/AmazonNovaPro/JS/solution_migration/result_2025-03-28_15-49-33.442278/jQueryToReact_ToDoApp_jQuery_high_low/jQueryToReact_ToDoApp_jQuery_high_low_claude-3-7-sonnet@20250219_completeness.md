- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos

    The provided code does not include a header component with a title and input field for creating new todos. While the code sets up the Redux store, components like TodoItem, TodoList, and TodoFooter, it's missing a header component or any component that would contain the title "todos" and an input field for adding new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos

    The TodoList component includes a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos:
    ```typescript
    <main className="main">
      <input id="toggle-all" className="toggle-all" type="checkbox" checked={allCompleted} onChange={handleToggleAll} />
      <label htmlFor="toggle-all">Mark all as complete</label>
      <ul id="todo-list" className="todo-list">
        {todos.map((todo) => (
          <TodoItem key={todo.id} todo={todo} />
        ))}
      </ul>
      ...
    </main>
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button

    In the TodoItem component, each todo has:
    - A toggle checkbox: `<input className="toggle" type="checkbox" checked={todo.completed} onChange={handleToggle} />`
    - A title display: `<label onDoubleClick={() => setEditing(true)}>{todo.title}</label>`
    - A delete button: `<button className="destroy" onClick={handleDestroy}></button>`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode

    The TodoItem component includes functionality to enable editing mode when double-clicking the label:
    ```typescript
    <label onDoubleClick={() => setEditing(true)}>{todo.title}</label>
    ```
    This sets the `editing` state to true, which then renders an input field instead of the label.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)

    The todoSlice includes a filter state and a setFilter action, and the TodoFooter component includes links for the different filters. However, the actual filtering implementation in the TodoList is not shown, which is why I'm not 100% confident.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization

    The TodoFooter component displays the count with proper pluralization:
    ```typescript
    <span id="todo-count" className="todo-count">
      <strong>{activeTodoCount}</strong> item{activeTodoCount !== 1 && 's'} left
    </span>
    ```

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter

    While the TodoFooter includes filter links, there is no code to highlight the currently selected filter. This would typically involve comparing the current filter state with each link and applying a CSS class accordingly.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist

    The TodoFooter shows a "Clear completed" button when there are completed todos, but it doesn't have the onClick handler to dispatch the removeCompleted action:
    ```typescript
    {completedTodoCount > 0 && (
      <button className="clear-completed">Clear completed</button>
    )}
    ```
    The code in TodoList has the proper implementation but this is inconsistent.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter

    The code doesn't include a component or functionality for creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter. An input field with associated handlers to capture the Enter key press and dispatch the addTodo action is missing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos

    The TodoItem component includes functionality to toggle the completion status of individual todos:
    ```typescript
    const handleToggle = () => dispatch(toggleTodo(todo.id));
    // ...
    <input className="toggle" type="checkbox" checked={todo.completed} onChange={handleToggle} />
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once
