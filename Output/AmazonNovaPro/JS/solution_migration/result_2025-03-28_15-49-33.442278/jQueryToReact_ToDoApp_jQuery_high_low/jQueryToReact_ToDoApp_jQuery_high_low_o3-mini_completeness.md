# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos  
  The provided answer does not include a dedicated header component or any input field for creating new todos. This functionality is essential for a TodoMVC application but is missing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos  
  The TodoList component clearly defines a <main> section that contains both the toggle-all checkbox and the list of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button  
  In the TodoItem component, a checkbox (for toggling), a label (for displaying the todo title), and a delete button (with class "destroy") are implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode  
  The TodoItem component uses an onDoubleClick event on the label to switch the item into editing mode.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  While the TodoFooter displays filter links for "All", "Active", and "Completed" and the Redux slice defines a filter state with an action (setFilter), the TodoList component does not actually filter the todos based on the current filter state. This disconnect results in incomplete filtering functionality.  
  (Confidence is 90% because the slice sets up the filter concept, but the UI does not apply filtering.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization  
  The code in the footer uses a conditional to display "item" or "items" based on the count, successfully addressing pluralization.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the currently selected filter  
  Although filter links are present in the TodoFooter, there is no logic to add any active styling or highlight to indicate which filter is currently selected.

- **Pass** (85%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist  
  A 'Clear completed' button is conditionally rendered both in the TodoList component and in the TodoFooter component. However, the button in the TodoFooter does not appear to have any event handling attached, which slightly reduces the confidence in its functionality.  
  (Confidence is 85% because the UI element is present, even though its interactive behavior is not fully implemented.)

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter  
  There is no component or functionality provided for adding new todos. The answer does not include an input field or an event handler for creating todos upon pressing Enter.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos  
  The TodoItem component includes a checkbox with an onChange event that invokes the toggleTodo action, satisfying this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once  
  The TodoList component contains the toggle-all checkbox that dispatches the toggleAll action, allowing users to toggle the completion status of every todo item.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management  
  The TodoItem component provides editing capabilities (switching the view on double-click, updating on blur or Enter, and reverting on Escape). Although it handles basic focus management through input focus changes, minor enhancements could be added for a more sophisticated focus transition.  
  (Confidence is 90% due to acceptable but not advanced focus management.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos  
  The TodoItem component provides a delete button that dispatches the removeTodo action, meeting the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos  
  The TodoList component includes a button which dispatches the removeCompleted action to clear completed todos.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status  
  Despite providing filter links and a filter state in the Redux slice, the TodoList component does not apply any filtering logic to show only active or completed todos as per the filter state. This means the filtering functionality is not fully implemented.
