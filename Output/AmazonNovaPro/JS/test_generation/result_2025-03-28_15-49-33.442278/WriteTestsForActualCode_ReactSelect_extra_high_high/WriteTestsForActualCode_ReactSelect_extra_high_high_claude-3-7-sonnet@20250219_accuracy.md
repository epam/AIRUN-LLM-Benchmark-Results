# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up in the test file
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test cases are properly isolated and do not have interdependencies
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that DOM events are simulated using proper React Testing Library methods
- **Pass** (100%): Validate that accessibility attributes are being tested appropriately
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure mocks are used for external dependencies where appropriate
- **Fail** (100%): Verify proper use of async/await for asynchronous testing where needed

  The provided code does not include any async/await syntax for handling asynchronous operations, which would be necessary for certain scenarios like testing loading states or delayed responses. When testing components with asynchronous behavior, proper async/await patterns with methods like `waitFor` or `findByRole` should be implemented, but these are absent in the current test suite.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all assertions use appropriate Jest matchers
- **Fail** (100%): Verify that tests include proper cleanup after each test case

  The code does not explicitly include cleanup procedures after test cases. When testing React components, it's important to clean up to prevent test leakage. While React Testing Library's render method includes an automatic cleanup mechanism, there is no explicit documentation or implementation of cleanup for any potential side effects or manual DOM manipulations.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test descriptions clearly indicate what functionality is being tested
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the test file follows best practices for organizing test cases (describe/it blocks)
- **Pass** (100%): Validate that all event handlers are tested using appropriate simulation methods
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the test environment correctly simulates both mouse and keyboard interactions
- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for touch events properly simulate mobile interactions

  The test suite does not include any tests specifically designed for touch events that would simulate mobile interactions. For a complete test suite of a Select component that may be used on mobile devices, tests for touch events (using `fireEvent.touchStart`, `fireEvent.touchEnd`, etc.) should be included to ensure proper functionality on touch-enabled devices.
