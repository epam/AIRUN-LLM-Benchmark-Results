# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist
  
  The answer includes complete test cases for basic component rendering with default props in the "Component Rendering Tests" section, checking if the component renders correctly with default props and verifies DOM structure and accessibility attributes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present
  
  The answer includes tests for keyboard navigation in the "User Interaction Testing" and "Menu and Options Tests" sections, covering arrow key navigation, enter key selection, and escape key for closing menu.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)
  
  The answer includes tests for mouse interactions in the "Mouse Interactions" section, testing menu opening on click and option selection on click.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior
  
  The answer explicitly includes tests for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior in the "State Management Tests" section.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values
  
  While the answer includes tests for selecting values, it doesn't explicitly test removing or clearing values. The tests focus on selecting options but don't verify behavior for removing selected options or clearing all selections.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented
  
  The answer includes tests for menu opening/closing behavior in the "Menu and Options Tests" section, testing menu opening on focus and closing on escape key press.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality
  
  The answer doesn't include any tests for option filtering or searching functionality, which is an important feature of a Select component.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist
  
  The answer doesn't include any tests specifically for multi-select behavior, which is a critical feature of many Select components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility
  
  The answer includes tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility in the "Accessibility Testing" section, verifying proper ARIA attributes and keyboard-only navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested
  
  The answer includes tests for edge cases in the "Edge Case Testing" section, specifically testing rendering with empty options.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states
  
  The answer includes tests for the loading state in the "Edge Case Testing" section, though it doesn't explicitly mention error states.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states
  
  The answer includes tests for disabled states in the "Edge Case Testing" section, confirming disabled attribute presence.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance
  
  The answer includes tests for large option sets in the "Performance Testing" section, testing rendering with 1000 options.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested
  
  The answer doesn't include specific tests for focus management during interactions, such as where focus should move after selecting an option or closing the menu.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering
  
  The answer doesn't include tests for placeholder text rendering or how selected values are displayed in the component.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations
  
  The answer doesn't include any tests for custom formatOptionLabel implementations or any custom rendering capabilities.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)
  
  The answer includes tests for the onChange callback in the state management tests section, but doesn't explicitly test onInputChange, onMenuOpen, or onMenuClose callbacks. However, some of these behaviors are implicitly tested in other sections.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)
  
  The answer doesn't include specific tests for indicator components like dropdown indicators, clear buttons, or loading indicators.
