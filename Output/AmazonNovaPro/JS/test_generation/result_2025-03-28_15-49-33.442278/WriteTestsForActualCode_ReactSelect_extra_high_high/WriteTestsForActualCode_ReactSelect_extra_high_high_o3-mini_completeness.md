# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist  
  The answer includes a "Component Rendering Tests" section that defines tests for basic rendering with default props.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present  
  While tests for ArrowDown, Enter, and Escape keys are provided, there is no test that explicitly verifies the behavior when the Tab key is used.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)  
  The tests cover mouse click interactions but do not include any tests to verify behavior on hover, which is required by the evaluation step.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior  
  The answer includes separate tests that check for controlled behavior (via value and onChange props) and uncontrolled behavior.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values  
  Although there are tests for selecting an option with a mouse click, there are no tests that cover the removal or clearing of values from the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented  
  The answer features tests that check for the menu opening on input focus and closing on pressing the Escape key.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality  
  There are no tests provided for filtering or searching options within the Select component.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist  
  The provided tests do not include any checks or scenarios specific to multi-select behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility  
  Tests are present to verify that the component includes the required ARIA attributes (e.g., aria-autocomplete, aria-expanded).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested  
  The answer includes tests to ensure the component renders correctly when provided with an empty options array.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states  
  Although a test case for the loading state exists, there is no test for handling error states.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states  
  The answer includes tests that validate the disabled state of the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance  
  A test is present to ensure that the component renders efficiently when provided with a large set of options.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested  
  Aside from testing that the menu opens on input focus, there are no additional tests verifying focus management during other interactions.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering  
  The test suite does not address how placeholders are rendered or how the selected value is displayed.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations  
  There are no tests covering the scenario where a custom formatOptionLabel function is provided.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)  
  Although onChange is indirectly tested, there are no tests for onInputChange, onMenuOpen, or onMenuClose callback functions.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)  
  The provided tests do not verify the rendering or behavior of any indicator components such as dropdown indicators, clear indicators, or loading indicators.
