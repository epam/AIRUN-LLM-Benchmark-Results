# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)
  
  The solution clearly uses Jasmine as the testing framework and Karma as the test runner, which are both appropriate and commonly used for AngularJS applications. The configuration is properly set up in the provided `karma.conf.js` file.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints
  
  The tests correctly use `$httpBackend` to mock REST API calls, as demonstrated in the `restFactory.spec.js` file where API endpoints are mocked with `$httpBackend.expectGET('api/blocks/1').respond(200, {});`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation
  
  The tests correctly implement `beforeEach` hooks to set up the testing environment before each test case and `afterEach` hooks to clean up, as shown in the REST Factory tests with `afterEach` verifying no outstanding expectations or requests.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls
  
  HTTP requests are properly mocked using `$httpBackend` and there's verification with `verifyNoOutstandingExpectation()` and `verifyNoOutstandingRequest()` to ensure all expected requests are made and completed.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection
  
  Dependencies are correctly injected using AngularJS dependency injection pattern with underscores (e.g., `inject(function(_REST_, _$httpBackend_)`) in the beforeEach blocks for each test suite.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations
  
  The tests handle asynchronous operations with mocked promises in the Page Controller tests, but there could be more detailed testing of promise rejection scenarios. The flush method is used in REST factory tests to handle async operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies
  
  The solution uses Jasmine's `spyOn` method appropriately to mock external dependencies, as shown in the Page Controller tests where REST methods are spied on and fake implementations provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization
  
  All tests follow the clear Jasmine `describe/it` pattern for organizing test suites and individual test cases, providing a readable test structure.

- **Fail** (95%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls
  
  While the solution demonstrates testing success scenarios, there's insufficient coverage of error handling cases for API calls. For comprehensive testing, we should see tests for how the application handles 4xx and 5xx responses from the API.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate
  
  The provided tests focus on service and controller methods but don't include simulations of user interactions like button clicks, form submissions, or other UI events that would be important for a complete test suite.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage
  
  The tests implement proper cleanup with `afterEach` hooks and verification methods like `verifyNoOutstandingExpectation()` to prevent state leakage between tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested
  
  Test descriptions are clear and descriptive, following good practices like "should initialize with default values" and "should make a GET request to fetch blocks" that clearly explain what's being tested.

- **Pass** (85%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible
  
  The tests generally focus on outputs and behavior, but some tests are closely tied to implementation details. For example, testing specific property names in factory objects could make tests brittle if internal implementation changes.
