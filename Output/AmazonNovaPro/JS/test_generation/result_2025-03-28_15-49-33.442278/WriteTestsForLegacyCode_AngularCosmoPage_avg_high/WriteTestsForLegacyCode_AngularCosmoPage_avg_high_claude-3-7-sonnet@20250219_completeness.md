# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources

    The provided tests for the REST factory only verify the existence of the `blocks` resource and test a GET request for this resource. There is no testing for other resources that would likely be defined in the REST factory (such as `content` which is referenced in other tests). The tests should cover all resources and their CRUD operations.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly

    While there are some tests for the Page factory that check initialization of `id` and `title` properties, the comment "Add more expectations for other properties" indicates the tests are incomplete. A comprehensive test suite should explicitly verify all properties of the Page factory.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly

    Similar to the Page factory tests, the Users factory tests only check initialization of `id` and `username` properties with an incomplete comment to "Add more expectations for other properties". A complete test suite would explicitly verify all properties.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods

    The controller tests only include three specific methods: initialization, deletePage, and savePage. The comment "Add more tests for other methods" indicates the tests are incomplete. A comprehensive test suite would cover all public methods of the controller.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller

    The provided tests include verification of page initialization logic with `expect($scope.page.id).toBe(Page.id)` and `expect($scope.page.title).toBe(Page.title)`.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation

    There are no tests specifically verifying the titleChange function or URL auto-generation functionality in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction

    No tests for the saveLocal function or localStorage interactions are included in the provided test suite.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality

    There are no tests for the autocompleteTags function or tag suggestion functionality in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)

    While there is a basic test for the savePage function, it doesn't cover different conditional branches such as handling new pages, duplicates, or updates. It only verifies that REST.content.save is called.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types

    The provided tests do not address any edge cases such as empty URLs or different page types.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly

    The test for the deletePage function verifies that REST.content.delete is called. However, it doesn't thoroughly test the complete deletion workflow including success/error handling, which would make for more comprehensive testing.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions

    There are no tests addressing page versions or localStorage interactions in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components

    While the answer mentions using Istanbul for code coverage, no actual coverage metrics are provided, and the incomplete nature of the tests suggests coverage would not reach 80% across all components.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling

    There are no tests specifically verifying event broadcasting or handling in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality

    No tests addressing date handling or scheduling functionality are included in the provided test suite.
