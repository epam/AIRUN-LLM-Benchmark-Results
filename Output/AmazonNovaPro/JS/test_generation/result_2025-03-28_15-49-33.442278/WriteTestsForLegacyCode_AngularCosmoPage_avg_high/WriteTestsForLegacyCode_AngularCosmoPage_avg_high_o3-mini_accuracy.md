# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)  
  The tests are built with Jasmine, and Karma is used as the test runner. This meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints  
  Although the tests use $httpBackend and spies to simulate REST API interactions, they adequately handle the endpoints.  
 
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation  
  Each test file correctly employs beforeEach (and in some cases afterEach) for setup and cleanup, ensuring isolation between tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls  
  In the REST Factory tests, the HTTP requests are intercepted by $httpBackend (with proper expectations and flushing), and no real API calls are made.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection  
  The provided tests make use of AngularJS dependency injection (using module and inject) to supply all necessary dependencies.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations  
  The tests simulate promises by returning an object with a then() callback in the controller tests. While this approach works, it somewhat simplifies asynchronous behavior rather than fully embracing async testing patterns. This simulated handling is acceptable, but there is a slight deviation from testing real asynchronous flows.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies  
  Spies are effectively used (e.g., spyOn for REST.content.delete and save methods), and external dependencies are mocked appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization  
  All tests are organized using the describe/it pattern, which makes it clear what is being tested in each specification.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls  
  The tests mainly demonstrate success scenarios only (e.g., verifying that API calls succeed and callbacks are executed). Error scenarios are not explicitly tested, which represents a gap in the test coverage.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate  
  The unit tests for controllers simulate actions like deleting or saving a page by calling the controller methods directly. While these tests do not simulate full DOM events, in the context of AngularJS controller testing this approach is generally acceptable. However, direct UI event simulation (if required) is not covered.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage  
  The use of afterEach hooks (e.g., for verifying $httpBackend expectations) and AngularJSâ€™s testing infrastructure ensures that the test state is properly reset between tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested  
  The usage of descriptive names (such as "should define blocks resource" and "should initialize with default values") makes it clear what the tests are intended to check.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible  
  The tests focus on the expected behavior and outputs (e.g., verifying that a service returns a default value or that REST methods are called) rather than delving into internal implementation details.
