- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions
  
  The todoModel.test.ts file is incomplete (it appears to be cut off) and does not show tests for the subscribe and inform functions that would be essential for testing the model's notification system.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
  
  While there is a test for clearing completed todos in the todoModel.test.ts file, the file appears to be cut off, so I cannot confirm if the implementation is complete.
