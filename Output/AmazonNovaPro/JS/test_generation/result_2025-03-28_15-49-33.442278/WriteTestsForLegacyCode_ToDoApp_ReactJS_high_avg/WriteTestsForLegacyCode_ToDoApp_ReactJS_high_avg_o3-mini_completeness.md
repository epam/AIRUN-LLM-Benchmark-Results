# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering  
  The TodoApp.test.tsx file includes a test named "renders correctly" which verifies that the component renders using getByPlaceholderText.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos  
  The TodoApp.test.tsx file contains a test "adds a todo on Enter key press" that verifies a new todo is added when the Enter key is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos  
  There is a test in TodoApp.test.tsx ("toggles all todos") that successfully checks whether toggling all todos sets the completed flag to true.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos  
  No tests are provided for filtering functionality (e.g., filtering views like active, completed, or all) in the TodoApp.test.tsx file.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The TodoApp.test.tsx file includes a test ("clears completed todos") that verifies the clearing of completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering  
  The TodoItem.test.tsx file has a test "renders correctly" which confirms correct rendering of the todo title.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos  
  Although there are tests for toggling ("handles toggling") and editing ("handles editing"), there is no dedicated test for destroying a todo, despite an onDestroy prop being passed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events  
  The test "handles cancelling" simulates a keyDown event with the Escape key, validating the handling of keyboard events.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts  
  The TodoFooter.test.tsx file tests rendering with a specific count (1 item left). While it tests one scenario, a more robust evaluation would include multiple counts. Therefore, I mark it as Pass with 90% confidence due to the limited range of test cases provided.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation  
  There is no test in TodoFooter.test.tsx validating filter navigation (i.e., switching between different filter states).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  A test ("handles clearing completed todos") is implemented in TodoFooter.test.tsx to verify the clear completed functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos  
  The TodoModel tests include tests for adding ("adds a todo"), toggling ("toggles all todos" and "toggles a todo"), saving ("saves a todo"), and destroying ("destroys a todo").

- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions  
  There is no test present for the subscribe and inform functions in the provided TodoModel tests.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  Although a test case for clearing completed todos is initiated, it is incomplete in the provided snippet.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation  
  No test file or test cases are provided for the uuid generation functionality in utils.ts.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality  
  There are no tests covering the pluralize functionality as expected in utils.ts.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations  
  The provided answer does not include tests for localStorage operations in the utils.ts file.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function  
  There are no tests provided for the extend function in utils.ts.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx  
  While TodoItem, TodoFooter, and TodoApp tests follow the [filename].test.tsx convention, the TodoModel tests are in a file named TodoModel.test.ts (without the .tsx extension) and no tests for utils.ts are given at all.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data  
  Sample todo data is defined (e.g., const todo = { id: '1', title: 'Test Todo', completed: false } in TodoItem tests) and in TodoApp tests as well, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented  
  Although a setupTests.ts file is provided which mocks the global Router, there are no actual test cases verifying routing functionality.
