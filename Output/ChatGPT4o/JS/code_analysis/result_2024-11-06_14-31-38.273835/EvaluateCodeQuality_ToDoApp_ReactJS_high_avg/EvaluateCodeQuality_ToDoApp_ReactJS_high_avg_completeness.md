# Evaluation Report

## Readability

### 1. Use of `var` instead of `let` or `const`
**Pass**: The code uses `let` and `const` instead of `var`.

### 2. Use of `this.refs` for DOM manipulation
**Pass**: The code replaces `this.refs` with `React.createRef()`.

### 3. Inline event handlers
**Pass**: Inline event handlers are moved to class methods.

## Maintainability

### 1. Hardcoded strings for routes
**Pass**: Routes are defined as constants.

### 2. Repeated logic for filtering todos
**Pass**: The logic for filtering todos is refactored into a separate method.

## Performance

### 1. Inefficient use of `findDOMNode`
**Pass**: `ReactDOM.findDOMNode` is replaced with `ref`.

### 2. Inefficient `map` and `filter` operations
**Pass**: The `map` operation is optimized to avoid creating a new array unnecessarily.

## Accessibility

### 1. Missing `aria-label` for buttons
**Pass**: `aria-label` attributes are added to buttons.

### 2. Missing `aria-live` for dynamic content
**Pass**: `aria-live` attribute is added to dynamic content.

## Best Practices

### 1. Use of `String` instead of `string`
**Pass**: `string` is used instead of `String`.

### 2. Use of `any` type
**Pass**: Specific types are used instead of `any`.

## Testing

### 1. Lack of testable code structure
**Pass**: The code structure is improved to make it more testable.

## Documentation

### 1. Lack of comments for complex logic
**Pass**: Detailed comments are added for complex logic.
