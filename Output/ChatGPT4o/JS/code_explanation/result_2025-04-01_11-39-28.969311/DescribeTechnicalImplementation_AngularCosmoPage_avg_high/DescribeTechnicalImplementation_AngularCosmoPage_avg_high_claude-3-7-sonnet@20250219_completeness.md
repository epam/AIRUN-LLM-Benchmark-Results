# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation includes a comprehensive component overview explaining the purpose and architecture
  
  The documentation provides a detailed component overview in section 1 that clearly explains the purpose of the Page Management Module as a core component of a CMS built with AngularJS. It outlines key functionality, architectural role, and application context, giving a comprehensive understanding of the module's purpose and how it fits into the larger application architecture.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all major components (REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and Page controller) are documented
  
  The documentation thoroughly covers the major components. Section 3 provides detailed interface specifications for the Page Factory, Users Factory, and REST Factory with their properties, types, descriptions, and requirements. While the Page controller isn't explicitly documented in its own section, its functionality is covered throughout the documentation, particularly in the usage examples in section 4.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure all significant features of the page management system are described
  
  Section 2 provides a comprehensive table of features including page creation, editing, URL auto-generation, local draft recovery, tag autocomplete, page deletion, content revisions, extras management, scheduling, internationalization, and notifications. Each feature is described along with its technical implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all form inputs and their behavior are documented
  
  The documentation covers form inputs and their behavior in multiple sections. Section 3.A details the Page Factory properties which correspond to form inputs, section 4.B provides HTML usage examples showing inputs with their associated behaviors (like titleChange()), and section 2 includes descriptions of behaviors like URL auto-generation from title input.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page versioning and revision system
  
  The documentation clearly explains the content revisions system. In the Key Functionality list it mentions "maintain content revisions," in the Component Features table it describes "Content Revisions" as saving snapshots of pages on each save using `REST.contentRevisions.save()`, and the REST Factory section documents the endpoints for managing revisions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation covers the tag system and autocomplete functionality
  
  The tag system and autocomplete functionality are well documented. In the Component Features table, "Tag Autocomplete" is described as suggesting tags based on user input using `REST.contentTags.query()`. The REST Factory section also documents the endpoint for managing tags (`api/content/:contentID/tags/`).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes explanation of error handling and user notifications
  
  The documentation covers user notifications in the Component Features table, explaining that the system "Displays success/error messages" using `$rootScope.$broadcast('notify', {...})`. While it doesn't provide exhaustive details on error handling, it does explain the notification mechanism used for communicating errors and successes to users.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page publishing workflow including scheduling
  
  The documentation clearly explains the publishing workflow including scheduling. In the Component Features table, it describes the "Scheduling" feature as allowing scheduling of page publication using `datetime-local` input and Unix timestamps. The Page Factory properties also include "published" and "published_date" fields with descriptions of their roles in the publishing workflow.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation details how content extras and additional metadata are managed
  
  Content extras and metadata management are well documented. The Component Features table describes "Extras Management" as storing additional metadata using `REST.contentExtras` and `REST.contentRevisionsExtras`. The Page Factory properties include "extras" described as "Additional metadata (e.g., featured image)" and the REST Factory section documents the endpoints for managing both extras and revision extras.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation explains how the UI interacts with the backend APIs
  
  The documentation thoroughly explains the UI-backend interaction. Section 3.C documents all REST endpoints used by the component, and the Component Features table describes how each feature interacts with these endpoints (e.g., Page Creation uses `REST.content.save()` with form data). The overall architecture explanation also clarifies that the module integrates with RESTful backend services via AngularJS's $resource.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes sample usage examples or patterns
  
  The documentation provides sample usage examples in section 4, including initialization code, HTML usage examples, and common use cases. Section 4.B specifically shows HTML code examples with controllers and model bindings, an
