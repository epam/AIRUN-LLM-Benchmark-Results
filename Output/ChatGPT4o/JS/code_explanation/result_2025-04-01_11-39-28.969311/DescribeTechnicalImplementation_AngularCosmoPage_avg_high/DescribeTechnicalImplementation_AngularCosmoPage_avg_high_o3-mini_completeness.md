# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation includes a comprehensive component overview explaining the purpose and architecture  
  The documentation opens with a Component Overview that clearly explains the purpose, key functionality, architectural role, and application context of the Page Management Module.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all major components (REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and Page controller) are documented  
  The documentation details the Page Factory, Users Factory, and REST Factory with clear tables and descriptions. It also references the Page controller in the HTML usage section with `ng-controller="pageCtrl"`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure all significant features of the page management system are described  
  The features section covers critical functionalities such as page creation, editing, URL auto-generation, local draft recovery, tag autocomplete, page deletion, content revisions, extras management, scheduling, internationalization, and notifications.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all form inputs and their behavior are documented  
  The HTML usage section provides clear examples of form inputs (title, description, URL) and indicates event handling (e.g., `ng-keyup="titleChange()"`), which documents their expected behaviors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page versioning and revision system  
  The content revisions feature is detailed, including the use of `REST.contentRevisions.save()` to manage snapshots of pages upon saving.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation covers the tag system and autocomplete functionality  
  The tag autocomplete feature is described in the features table, mentioning the use of `REST.contentTags.query()` to suggest tags based on user input.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the documentation includes explanation of error handling and user notifications  
  The notifications feature is mentioned with the use of `$rootScope.$broadcast('notify', {...})` to display success/error messages. Although the mechanism for handling errors could be expanded, the provided details suffice to meet the requirement.  
  Explanation: Confidence is slightly less than 100% because additional details on error handling flows could enhance clarity.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page publishing workflow including scheduling  
  The documentation covers scheduling explicitly by describing the use of a datetime-local input and Unix timestamps, as well as the scheduling behavior for page publication.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation details how content extras and additional metadata are managed  
  The documentation includes a dedicated feature for extras management, explaining the role of `REST.contentExtras` and `REST.contentRevisionsExtras` in storing additional metadata like featured images.

- **Pass** (95%): Check that the documentation explains how the UI interacts with the backend APIs  
  The documentation clearly outlines API resource endpoints and their usage (e.g., `REST.content.save()`, `REST.content.update()`), and provides sample initializations and HTML usage.  
  Explanation: Confidence is 95% because while the integration is clear, some implementation specifics between certain components could be further detailed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes sample usage examples or patterns  
  The usage documentation section provides code examples that demonstrate how to initialize the AngularJS module and how to use the form inputs within a controller.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the documentation explains all significant event broadcasting and inter-component communication  
  The documentation mentions event broadcasting (e.g., `$rootScope.$broadcast('notify', {...})`) for user notifications.  
  Explanation: Confidence is 90% because while notifications are covered, the explanation of broader inter-component communication is not extensively detailed.
