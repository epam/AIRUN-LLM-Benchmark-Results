# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps:

1. **Confirm the component includes a search feature in the dropdown.**
   - **Pass**: The component includes an input field within the dropdown for searching options (`<input className="search-input" ... />`).

2. **Check that the component is navigable via keyboard.**
   - **Pass**: The component handles keyboard events (`onKeyDown` handler) to navigate through options using arrow keys and select options using the Enter key.

3. **Verify items in the dropdown can be selected by pressing the Enter key.**
   - **Pass**: The `handleKeyDown` function includes logic to select the highlighted option when the Enter key is pressed.

4. **Confirm the dropdown list opens when Enter is pressed.**
   - **Pass**: The `handleKeyDown` function includes logic to open the dropdown when the Enter key is pressed and the dropdown is not already open.

5. **Ensure the focus returns to the select component after the dropdown is closed.**
   - **Pass**: The `handleSelect` function sets the focus back to the input field after an option is selected.

6. **Verify the dropdown closes upon selecting an item via keyboard.**
   - **Pass**: The `handleSelect` function sets `isOpen` to `false`, closing the dropdown after an option is selected.

7. **Verify the dropdown closes upon selecting an item via mouse.**
   - **Pass**: The `handleSelect` function is called on `onMouseDown` event of an option, which closes the dropdown.

8. **Confirm the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed.**
   - **Pass**: The `handleKeyDown` function includes logic to close the dropdown when the Escape key is pressed.

9. **Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component.**
