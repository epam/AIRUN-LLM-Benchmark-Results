# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps:

1. **Ensure that the API call to https://swapi.dev/api/people is made using axios.**
   - **Pass**: The code uses `axios.get('https://swapi.dev/api/people')` to fetch data from the SWAPI API.

2. **Make sure the data is fetched initially without any input fields.**
   - **Pass**: The data is fetched using the `useEffect` hook which runs once when the component mounts, without requiring any input fields.

3. **Ensure a loader or loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.**
   - **Pass**: The code uses a `loading` state to display a "Loading..." message while the data is being fetched.

4. **Verify that errors are logged to the console if the API call fails.**
   - **Pass**: The code includes a `catch` block that logs errors to the console using `console.error('Error fetching characters:', error)`.

5. **Ensure that the fetched characters are displayed in a list format.**
   - **Pass**: The fetched characters are displayed in a list format using an unordered list (`<ul>`) and list items (`<li>`).

6. **Make sure each list item has a unique key derived from the character URL.**
   - **Pass**: Each list item uses the character's URL as a unique key (`<li key={character.url}>`).
