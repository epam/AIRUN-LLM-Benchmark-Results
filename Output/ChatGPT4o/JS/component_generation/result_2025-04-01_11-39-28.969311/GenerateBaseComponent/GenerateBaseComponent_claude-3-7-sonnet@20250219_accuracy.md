# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x
  
  The component imports from React and uses React hooks such as useState, useRef, useEffect, useCallback, and useMemo, which are compatible with React 18.x. The component is implemented as a functional component with React.FC typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
  
  The component uses TypeScript throughout with proper type definitions including Option type, SearchableSelectProps interface, and proper typing for all refs, state variables, and event handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling
  
  The component includes an import statement for './index.css' and a complete CSS file is provided with appropriate styling for all component elements.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments
  
  The provided code is clean, well-structured, and doesn't contain any TODO comments or unfinished sections.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility
  
  The component properly uses useState hooks for managing state including isOpen, searchTerm, and highlightedIndex. The value prop is used to track the selected item and is properly passed in from the parent component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props
  
  The component accepts props for options, placeholder, onChange, value, id, and className, making it highly reusable and customizable.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection
  
  The component implements comprehensive keyboard navigation through the handleKeyDown function, supporting ArrowDown, ArrowUp, Enter, and Escape keys with appropriate functionality for each.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions
  
  The component uses useRef appropriately for DOM element references (containerRef, inputRef, listRef) and interacts with the DOM in a React-friendly way, using useEffect for event listeners and clean-up.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques
  
  The component implements focus management by focusing the input when the dropdown is opened, using setTimeout to ensure the focus happens after the state update, and managing tabIndex appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
  
  The component includes comprehensive ARIA attributes including aria-haspopup, aria-expanded, role="combobox", aria-owns, aria-controls, aria-label, role="listbox", role="option", and aria-selected, ensuring good accessibility.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  The code appears to be free of console errors and warnings, but without runtime testing, there's a small possibility that certain edge cases could produce warnings.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component
  
  The component uses useMemo for filtered options and useCallback for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders. The overall component structure follows React best practices for performance optimization, though without profiling we can't be 100% certain of perfect render performance.
