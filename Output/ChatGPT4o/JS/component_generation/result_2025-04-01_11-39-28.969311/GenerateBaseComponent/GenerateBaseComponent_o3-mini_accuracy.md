# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (95%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  Although the code does not explicitly declare the version, it uses React hooks and conventions that are standard in React 18.x. The accompanying documentation also states it was built with React 18.x. The slight uncertainty comes from the version not being enforced in the code, but we can trust the provided description.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  The code uses a .tsx file extension and declares types for props and other variables, showing proper usage of TypeScript.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  The file structure lists an "index.css", and its full content is provided, confirming its inclusion.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  The code is clear, free of placeholder TODO comments, and appears ready for production.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  The component employs React state (e.g., isOpen, searchTerm, highlightedIndex) to manage the dropdown and selection state correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  The component accepts configurable props such as options, placeholder, onChange, value, id, and className, making it reusable in different contexts.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  The component defines handlers for ArrowDown, ArrowUp, Enter, and Escape keys, ensuring robust keyboard navigation and selection.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  The component correctly uses useRef for DOM elements (containerRef, inputRef, listRef) and proper cleanup for event listeners. A minor note is that further testing would be needed to guarantee perfect adherence in all edge cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  Focus management is handled appropriately by focusing the input when opening the dropdown and managing tabIndex and onClick events.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  ARIA attributes such as aria-haspopup, aria-expanded, role attributes, aria-owns, and aria-controls are correctly applied, enhancing accessibility.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  The code appears to be production ready and free of problematic constructs; however, actual runtime testing would be required to confirm there are no console errors or warnings across all use cases.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  The component optimizes performance using useMemo and useCallback, which should help prevent unnecessary re-renders. Some uncertainty remains without profiling data, but the implementation follows best practices.
