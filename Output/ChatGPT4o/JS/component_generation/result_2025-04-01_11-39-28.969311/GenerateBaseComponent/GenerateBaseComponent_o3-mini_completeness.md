# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component renders a container with a "select-display" element that shows the selected option or placeholder. When open, a dropdown with an options list is rendered.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  When the dropdown is open (i.e. when isOpen is true), an input with class "search-input" is rendered at the top of the dropdown to allow filtering of options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The code handles selection either via mouse click (handleOptionClick) or via keyboard (using the Enter key) and calls onChange with a single selected Option.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The handleKeyDown function processes 'ArrowDown' and 'ArrowUp' key events, updating the highlightedIndex accordingly. This confirms keyboard navigation is supported.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  When the dropdown is open, pressing Enter selects the option corresponding to the current highlightedIndex, triggering the onChange callback and closing the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  When the component is focused and the dropdown is closed, pressing Enter will open the dropdown. When already open, pressing Enter on a highlighted item selects it and then closes the dropdown, thereby toggling its visibility.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  Although the dropdown closes after an item is selected or on pressing Escape, there is no explicit mechanism in the code to shift focus back to the select container after it closes. The component manages focus when opening (e.g. focusing the search input), but it does not handle focus management to return focus to the select display once the dropdown is dismissed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  The handleOptionClick function is invoked on mouse clicks and, once an option is clicked, it calls onChange and then sets isOpen to false, ensuring the dropdown is closed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  When an option is selected using the Enter key (while navigating with the keyboard), the code explicitly calls setIsOpen(false) after calling onChange.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  The handleKeyDown function checks for the 'Escape' key and, when pressed, closes the dropdown by setting isOpen to false and resetting the search term and highlightedIndex.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  The useEffect hook sets up a mousedown event listener on the document which triggers a callback to close the dropdown if the click occurred outside the componentâ€™s container.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  When the component is focused and the dropdown is not open, pressing the Enter key triggers a state change (setIsOpen(true)), opening the dropdown and moving focus to the search input.
