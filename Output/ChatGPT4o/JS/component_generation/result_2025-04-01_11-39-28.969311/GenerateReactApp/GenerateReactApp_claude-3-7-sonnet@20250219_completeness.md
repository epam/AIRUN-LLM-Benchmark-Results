# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The application correctly fetches character data from the SWAPI API using Axios in the `fetchCharacters` function and displays them in a list format in the `CharacterList` component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The application has appropriate loading state management with the line `if (loading) { return <div>Loading characters...</div>; }` in the CharacterList component, which displays a loading message while data is being fetched.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The code maps through all characters returned in the API response with `{characters.map((character) => (<li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>))}`, ensuring all fetched characters are displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  The application focuses solely on displaying Star Wars characters and does not implement any search functionality or user input fields.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character is rendered as a list item (`<li>`) with the character's name displayed: `<li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The structure matches a typical Create React App setup, with dependencies like `react-scripts` in package.json and the typical file structure of a CRA project.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The application correctly implements useState hooks for managing loading, error, and character data states:
  ```tsx
  const [characters, setCharacters] = useState<Character[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each list item has a unique key using the character's URL: `<li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  The application handles empty data states by explicitly checking for loading and error states before rendering the character list. If characters array is empty after loading is complete and no error occurred, it would render an empty `<ul></ul>`, which is an appropriate way to handle no data.
