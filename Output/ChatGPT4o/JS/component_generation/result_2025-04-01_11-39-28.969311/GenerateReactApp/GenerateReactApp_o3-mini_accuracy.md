# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses React 18.x or newer by checking the package.json dependencies  
  The package.json shows "react": "^18.2.0" and "react-dom": "^18.2.0", confirming React 18.x is used.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that TypeScript is properly implemented with appropriate type definitions for all components, props, and states  
  The project uses a tsconfig.json with strict settings and defines clear interfaces (e.g., Character, SwapiResponse) in the types folder. Components and API calls are properly typed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Axios is used for API requests to fetch data from the Star Wars API endpoint  
  The file src/api.ts uses Axios to request data from 'https://swapi.dev/api/people', fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles API errors gracefully with appropriate error states or messages  
  The CharacterList component catches API request errors and updates the error state, displaying a user-friendly error message.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the character data is fetched on component mount using the useEffect hook  
  The useEffect hook in CharacterList is used to trigger the API call on component mount.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application properly manages component rendering optimization  
  The component is structured to render only when needed (using state and effect hooks). However, while the code is appropriately simple, it does not include advanced optimization techniques (like memoization) which might be expected in more complex scenarios. Given the simplicity of the application, this is acceptable.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows React best practices using hooks appropriately  
  The application correctly uses useState and useEffect, and the hooks are used in a manner consistent with React best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't contain any TODO comments or unnecessary code  
  There are no TODO comments or any extraneous code present in the project.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the codebase has minimal comments that only clarify complex logic when necessary  
  The code includes necessary documentation (e.g., file descriptions and structured project details) without cluttering the code with unnecessary comments.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the API endpoint 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' is being called correctly  
  The API call within src/api.ts correctly targets the SWAPI endpoint 'https://swapi.dev/api/people'.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application renders without console errors or warnings  
  Based on the provided code and standard setup, the application appears to be well-configured to render without console errors or warnings.
