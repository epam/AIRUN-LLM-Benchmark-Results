# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The CharacterList component fetches data from the SWAPI API and maps over the returned characters to display them.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The component conditionally renders a "Loading characters..." message while the data is being fetched.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  All characters fetched from the API (via the data.results array) are rendered as list items.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  The provided code strictly displays characters without incorporating any search bar or input fields.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each list item renders the character’s name (using {character.name}) ensuring they are displayed correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The project includes "react-scripts" in the package.json and follows a typical CRA structure, which confirms it was set up using Create React App.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The CharacterList component uses React state (via useState) to manage loading, error, and characters, handling state transitions properly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  Each character list item uses the character’s URL as a key, providing a unique identifier for React's list rendering.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  The component renders an empty list (<ul>...</ul>) when there are no characters. While it may be beneficial to show an explicit "no data" message, displaying an empty list without errors is acceptable.  
  Explanation: A more explicit empty state message could be considered better UX, but the current implementation does not cause any malfunction and meets the basic requirement.
