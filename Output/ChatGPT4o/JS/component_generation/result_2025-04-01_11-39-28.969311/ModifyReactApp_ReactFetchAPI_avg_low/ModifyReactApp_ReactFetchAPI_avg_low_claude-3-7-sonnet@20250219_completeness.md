# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name
  
  The solution includes a search input field with appropriate placeholder "Search characters..." and an aria-label. It uses the search parameter in the API call which filters characters by name.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests
  
  The solution implements a loading state that displays "Loading..." when the API request is in progress, through the `loading` state variable and the conditional rendering in the `characterList` memo.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query
  
  The component loads data on mount using the useEffect hook that triggers `fetchCharacters` with an empty query, which fetches all characters initially.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type
  
  The solution implements a debounced search mechanism that updates results as users type without triggering an API call for every keystroke.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found
  
  The solution displays "No characters found." when the characters array is empty through conditional rendering in the `characterList` memo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design
  
  The solution includes CSS with responsive design principles such as max-width container, percentage-based widths, and box-sizing to ensure proper rendering on different screen sizes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response
  
  The component updates the `characters` state with API response data and renders the list of character names using the map function.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed
  
  The solution includes error handling within the component using try/catch and also provides an optional ErrorBoundary component for wrapping the entire application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props
  
  The solution defines TypeScript interfaces for `Character`, `SwapiResponse`, and uses proper typing for all state variables and function parameters.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities
  
  The solution enhances the original functionality by adding search capabilities without removing any existing features. It displays the list of characters with proper formatting and provides seamless searching.
