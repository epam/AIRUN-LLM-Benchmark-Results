# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type  
  The component updates the searchQuery state via the onChange handler on the input field.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls  
  The useEffect hook implements a debounce using setTimeout with a 500ms delay, which is within the specified range.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured  
  The code imports axios and uses axios.get with proper configuration for making API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses  
  The component, API responses, and events are fully typed using TypeScript interfaces and generics.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters  
  The API endpoint uses a dynamic parameters object with the search key when a query is provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate  
  useMemo is used to memoize the rendered character list and useCallback is used for fetchCharacters and handleInputChange.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback  
  Error handling is provided in the try/catch block during API calls, and an error message is rendered when needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing  
  The debouncing mechanism ensures that the API is called only after 500ms of no new keystrokes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices  
  The component uses useState for state management and correctly separates immediate and debounced search states.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code  
  The provided code is clean with no unused imports or excessive commented-out code, ensuring better maintainability.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests  
  The loading state is set before and after API requests (using the finally clause) and displayed appropriately in the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns  
  The component uses modern React features such as hooks, and the index.tsx file uses ReactDOM.createRoot in line with React 18.x.
