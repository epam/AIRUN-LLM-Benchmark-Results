# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The code includes an input field with placeholder "Search characters..." and an onChange handler (handleInputChange) that updates the search query. This meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  When the state "loading" is true, the component displays a div with the text "Loading...", which serves as a loading indicator.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  The component initializes "searchQuery" as an empty string and triggers an API call during mount via useEffect using the debounced query. This ensures initial data loading.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  The debounce mechanism implemented via useEffect delays updates to the search query, ensuring that search results are updated dynamically (with a 500ms debounce) as users type.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  The component renders a message ("No characters found.") when the characters array is empty, providing appropriate visual feedback.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The accompanying CSS, including a max-width for the container and responsive box-sizing for the input, helps ensure the component adapts well to different screen sizes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  After the API call resolves, the component maps over the "characters" array to render a list of characters. This confirms that the search results are displayed correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  An optional ErrorBoundary component is provided which catches errors in the component tree and renders a fallback UI. This meets the requirement for error handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The code defines interfaces such as Character and SwapiResponse, and uses TypeScript annotations throughout, ensuring type safety and clarity.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The original functionality (data fetching on mount and displaying the character list) is preserved, while the search functionality is added without interfering with the initial data load.
