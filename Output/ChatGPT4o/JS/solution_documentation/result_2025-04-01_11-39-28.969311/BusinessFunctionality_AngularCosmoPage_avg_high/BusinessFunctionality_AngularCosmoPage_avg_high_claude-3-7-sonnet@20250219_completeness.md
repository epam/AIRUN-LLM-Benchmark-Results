A complete documentation would enumerate all available endpoints with their HTTP methods.

   While "extras" are mentioned as additional metadata and there's a brief reference that these could include a featured image, the documentation doesn't specifically detail how featured images are handled, uploaded, processed, or displayed in the application.
