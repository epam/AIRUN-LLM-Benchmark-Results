  Form validations such as required fields and URL restrictions are detailed.

- **Fail** (85%): Validate the documentation explains error handling during API operations  
  Although error messages and notifications are mentioned via the `$rootScope.$broadcast('notify')` mechanism, there is no detailed explanation of how API errors are managed (e.g. retry logic or error responses).  
  Explanation: The information provided is minimal on error handling for API operations, leading to a lower confidence rating.
