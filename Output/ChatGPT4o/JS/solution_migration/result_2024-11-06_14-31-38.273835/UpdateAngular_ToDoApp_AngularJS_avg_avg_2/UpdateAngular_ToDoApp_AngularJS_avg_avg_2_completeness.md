# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Confirm that the application initializes correctly and loads persisted todos.
- **Pass**: The `TodoEffects` class includes an effect to persist todos to `localStorage`. The application should initialize correctly and load persisted todos from `localStorage`.

### Step 2: Ensure that the todo list displays correctly and is interactive.
- **Pass**: The `TodoListComponent` correctly subscribes to the `todos$` observable and displays the list of todos. The list is interactive with options to toggle, edit, and remove todos.

### Step 3: Verify that adding a new todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoComponent` includes a form to add new todos. The `addTodo` method dispatches the `addTodo` action, which is handled by the `todoReducer` to add a new todo to the state.

### Step 4: Check that editing a todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoListComponent` includes an `edit` method that prompts the user to edit a todo. The `editTodo` action is dispatched and handled by the `todoReducer` to update the todo's title.

### Step 5: Confirm that toggling a todo item completion status works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoListComponent` includes a `toggle` method that dispatches the `toggleTodo` action. The `todoReducer` handles this action to toggle the completion status of the todo.

### Step 6: Ensure that removing a todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoListComponent` includes a `remove` method that dispatches the `removeTodo` action. The `todoReducer` handles this action to remove the todo from the state.

### Step 7: Verify that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works.
- **Pass**: The `TodoListComponent` includes a `markAll` method that dispatches the `markAll` action. The `todoReducer` handles this action to mark all todos as complete or incomplete.

### Step 8: Check that the filter functionality (All, Active, Completed) works.
- **Fail**: The `selectFilteredTodos` selector is missing the `props` parameter in the `createSelector` function. This will cause the filter functionality to not work as expected.

### Step 9: Confirm that the "Clear completed" button works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `FooterComponent` includes a `clearCompleted` method that dispatches the `clearCompleted` action. The `todoReducer` handles this action to remove all completed todos from the state.

### Step 10: Ensure that the application is responsive and functions correctly on different screen sizes.
- **Pass**: The application uses the `todomvc-common` and `todomvc-app-css` stylesheets, which are designed to be responsive and work well on different screen sizes.

### Summary
- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 10
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 9
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 1

### Conclusion
The application is mostly functional with the exception of the filter functionality, which needs to be corrected by properly passing the `props` parameter to the `selectFilteredTodos` selector.
