# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components
  
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately
  
- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation
  
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization
  
- **Fail** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization
  
  The provided code does not implement code splitting. Code splitting typically involves using dynamic imports with React.lazy() and Suspense to load components only when needed. There is no evidence of React.lazy(), Suspense, or dynamic imports in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations
  
  The code does not use React.memo for any components. React.memo is typically used to prevent unnecessary re-renders of expensive components, but there are no instances of React.memo in the provided code.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks
  
  The useEffect in the PageForm component has a dependency array `[title, description, urlValue, tags]`, which is appropriate. However, it's missing the `dispatch` function which is used inside the effect. While this won't cause a bug in most cases (as dispatch remains stable), it's technically not following the exhaustive deps rule.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models
  
- **Fail** (80%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state
  
  While the code does access state via `useAppSelector((state) => state.page)`, it doesn't define and use memoized selectors (typically created with createSelector from Redux Toolkit) for derived data. This is a common practice in Redux applications to prevent unnecessary recalculations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks
