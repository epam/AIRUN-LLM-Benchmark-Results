# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (70%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented

    The code shows implementation of create and update functionality in `REST.content` and the `PageForm` component, but the delete and duplicate functionalities aren't clearly implemented in the provided components. While the API endpoints for deletion exist in `restAPI.ts`, there are no UI components or handlers for deletion or duplication shown in the PageForm or elsewhere.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present

    The code has a `type` field in the Page interface and in the Redux state, but there's no UI component or form element in the `PageForm.tsx` that allows users to select or change the page type. The page type is mentioned when saving content but seems to be using a default value from state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists

    URL auto-generation from title is clearly implemented in the PageForm component with the `handleTitleChange` function, which converts the title to a URL-friendly format when `autoURL` is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented

    Tag management with autocomplete suggestions is well implemented in the `PageForm.tsx` component with `handleTagChange` and `handleSuggestionClick` functions, which manage the tags array and fetch suggestions from the API.

- **Fail** (95%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available

    The code doesn't show UI elements or handlers for selecting publish status options (publish, draft, schedule). While there are fields for `published` and `published_date` in the Page interface and state, there's no UI exposed in the PageForm to manage these statuses.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented

    The Page interface includes a `scheduleDate` field, but there's no UI component in the PageForm or handlers to set or manage this date. The functionality to schedule content for future publishing isn't clearly implemented.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present

    The code shows a `useLocalStorage` hook and usage in `PageForm.tsx` to store title and description, but explicit comparison and restoration features aren't fully demonstrated. The basics are there but the complete functionality to compare versions or restore from localStorage isn't fully shown.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented

    The code only uses standard `alert()` for error notifications in the `handleSave` function. There's no comprehensive notification system implemented for success/error messages across the application.

- **Pass** (70%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present

    There is minimal form validation in the `handleSave` function checking if title or URL is empty, but it doesn't validate page type or other required fields. The validation is very basic and doesn't match what would be expected in a complete migration.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled

    The API endpoints in `restAPI.ts` appear comprehensive, covering content, contentTags, contentExtras, contentRevisions, and contentRevisionsExtras, which likely mirrors all the endpoints from the original code.

- **Fail** (95%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented

    While there's a reducer function `updateExtras` in pageSlice.ts and API endpoints for extras management in restAPI.ts, there's no UI component or form element in PageForm.tsx that allows users to manage extras. The structure exists but the functionality isn't exposed.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained

    There are API endpoints for revision management in restAPI.ts, but no UI components or handlers to view, create, or manage revisions. The functionality to interact with revisions isn't implemented in the provided code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components

    The code is well-organized into feature folders with clear separation of business logic (slices, API calls) from UI components. The folder structure follows modern React best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved

    Translation functionality is properly implemented using i18next and react-i18next. The `useTranslation` hook is used in components to access translations.
