# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props  
  All components and modules (e.g., PageForm, AppRouter, custom hooks) are written in TypeScript and generally provide types for function props and state variables.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management  
  Redux Toolkitâ€™s createSlice is used in the pageSlice implementation, and the store is configured using configureStore.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components  
  All React components (PageForm, AppRouter, etc.) are implemented as functional components.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately  
  The code uses useState and useEffect appropriately. Although useCallback and useMemo are not used, their absence does not indicate a misuse given the simplicity of the component logic. This evaluation is at 95% due to the possibility of optimizing more complex scenarios where memoization might be beneficial.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource  
  API communication is implemented using axios in the REST API module.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components  
  The PageForm component manages form data via controlled inputs (value and onChange).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation  
  React Router v6 is used, and routes are properly defined in the AppRouter component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization  
  Internationalization is handled using i18next with the initReactI18next plugin.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization  
  There is no evidence of code splitting techniques (e.g., React.lazy, Suspense) to dynamically import modules, which could enhance performance in larger applications.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations  
  The provided code does not use React.memo to optimize expensive renders. No component is wrapped in React.memo even though such optimization might be beneficial in case of heavy render operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks  
  The useEffect hook in PageForm properly specifies its dependency array ([title, description, urlValue, tags]), ensuring updates only when needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models  
  The code includes TypeScript interfaces for data models (e.g., Page in types/page.ts and User in types/user.ts), covering the necessary fields.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state  
  The PageForm component uses the useAppSelector hook to access the page state from the Redux store.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations  
  Redux action creators (setPage, resetPage, updateExtras) are implemented in the page slice for managing state mutations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks  
  The custom hook useLocalStorage is implemented to manage local storage with type safety.
