# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
  The provided solution includes mechanisms to create (via save API) and update (via Redux state updates) a page but does not implement functionality for deleting or duplicating pages.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
  Although the page object contains a "type" property, there is no UI element or explicit handling that allows the user to select or modify the page type.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
  The code includes logic in the title change handler where the URL is automatically generated from the title when the auto-generation flag is enabled.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
  The solution implements tag management by splitting comma-separated input and querying for autocomplete suggestions when the last tag is entered. Additionally, clicking on a suggestion updates the tag list.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
  There is no visible UI or control for selecting between publish, draft, or schedule statuses, despite the initial state including a "published" property.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
  While the page slice sets a default scheduling date (via scheduleDate), there is no mechanism in the UI to configure or display scheduled publishing options for the user.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
  Although a local storage hook is present and used to persist title and description, there is no functionality to compare versions or restore a previous version from local storage.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
  The solution relies on basic alert dialogs for error and success messages instead of a dedicated notification system that would typically offer a richer user experience.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
  There is minimal validation in the save handler for the title and URL fields, yet required validations for page type (or other critical fields) are missing.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
  The REST API service defines endpoints for content, tags, extras, and revisions. Although not every endpoint is integrated into the UI (for example, delete or duplicate actions), the API layer itself is comprehensively implemented.  
  (Note: Confidence is 90% because integration details for some endpoints are not visible in the UI code.)

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
  While the page slice contains an "updateExtras" reducer and API endpoints for extras are defined, there is no UI component to manage or update extras directly.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
  The REST API includes endpoints for content revisions and revision extras. However, there is no interface or logic presented in the UI to handle revision history.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
  The code is clearly structured into folders such as features, hooks, types, routes, etc., and it cleanly separates API calls, Redux slices, and UI components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
  i18next is set up properly and translation function calls (t) are used within components to support internationalization.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
  The router is configured with routes ("/new" and "/:url") that adhere to a clear URL structure reminiscent of the original AngularJS applicationâ€™s parameterized routes.
