# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling
  
  The code clearly shows the use of Angular's Reactive Forms approach. The component imports necessary modules like `FormBuilder`, `FormGroup`, and `Validators` from '@angular/forms'. The form is initialized in the `ngOnInit` method using `this.fb.group()` and includes form controls for name, email, and password.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)
  
  The form validation is properly implemented with:
  - Name: `[Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3), Validators.maxLength(60)]`
  - Email: `[Validators.required, Validators.email]`
  - Password: `[Validators.required, Validators.minLength(6)]`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use
  
  The component implements custom async validators `nameAsyncValidator` and `emailAsyncValidator` that check if the name and email are already in use by calling the API methods `isName` and `isEmail`. These validators are properly added to the respective form controls.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched
  
  The `form-group.component.html` template applies dynamic CSS classes based on validation status:
  `[ngClass]="{'has-error': showError, 'has-success': control.touched && control.valid"}`
  This ensures appropriate styling feedback when fields are touched.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions
  
  The `onSubmit` method properly dispatches the signup action with the form values. The `auth.effects.ts` file shows the effect that handles the action by calling the API service's signup method and dispatching success or failure actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails
  
  The `form-group.component.html` includes:
  `<span *ngIf="showError" class="help-block">{{ errorMessage }}</span>`
  The component also has logic in the `errorMessage` getter to return appropriate messages for different validation errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service
  
  The `DocumentTitleComponent` properly uses Angular's Title service to set the document title, and the signup component passes the title via `title = getTitle('Signup')` and `<app-document-title [title]="title">`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management
  
  The code shows proper implementation of NgRx. The component injects the Store and dispatches actions. The effects file contains the logic to handle the signup action, make API calls, and dispatch success/failure actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress
  
  The submit button includes:
  `[disabled]="submitting || signupForm.invalid"`
  The component sets `submitting = true` in the `onSubmit` method.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses
  
  In `auth.effects.ts`, the signup effect properly handles success by navigating to the home page and dispatching the success action, and handles errors by dispatching the failure action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management
  
  The component follows best practices with proper imports, decorators, lifecycle hooks (ngOnInit), clear method naming, and separation of concerns.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises
  
  The API service properly uses Angular's HttpClient for making HTTP requests, returning Observables rather than Promises.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements
  
  The `FormGroupComponent` includes an `errorMessage` getter that returns appropriate error messages for different validation scenarios, matching the requirements.
