# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The SignupComponent initializes a FormGroup using FormBuilder, confirming the use of Angular's Reactive Forms.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The form controls for name, email, and password are configured with Validators.required, Validators.minLength, Validators.maxLength (for name), and Validators.email, ensuring proper synchronous validation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  The component applies asynchronous validators (nameAsyncValidator and emailAsyncValidator) to the respective fields, which check the availability of the name and email via the API.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The FormGroupComponent defines getter methods (showError and errorMessage) and applies CSS classes (has-error/has-success) based on the control's touched and validity status.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  The onSubmit() method dispatches a signup action with form values to the @ngrx/store, and the corresponding effect handles the API call to the authentication service.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The FormGroupComponent's template includes a span that displays contextual error messages based on validation errors, ensuring feedback upon invalid input.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  The DocumentTitleComponent uses Angular's Title service in its ngOnInit lifecycle hook to set the page title based on the provided title input.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The signup component dispatches actions to the store, and AuthEffects handles asynchronous side effects using @ngrx/effects, indicating proper state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button is bound to a disabled property that becomes true when either the form is invalid or the submission is in progress (submitting flag is true).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  The AuthEffects implementation maps a successful API call to dispatch a signupSuccess action (and navigates to the home page) while catching errors and dispatching signupFailure.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The code structure, separation of concerns between components, services, and state management, and the use of lifecycle hooks (ngOnInit) indicate adherence to Angular best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The ApiService utilizes Angular's HttpClient for making HTTP requests, confirming the correct and modern approach to API interaction.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The error messages for required fields, minlength, maxlength, invalid email, and custom asynchronous errors (nameTaken and emailTaken) are correctly implemented in the FormGroupComponent.
