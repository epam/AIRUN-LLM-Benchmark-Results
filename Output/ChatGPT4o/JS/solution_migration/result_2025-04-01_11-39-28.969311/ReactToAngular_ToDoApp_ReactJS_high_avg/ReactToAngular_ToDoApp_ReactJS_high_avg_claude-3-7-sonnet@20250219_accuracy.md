# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
- **Fail** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
  
  The migration plan includes installing @ngrx/effects with `npm install @ngrx/store @ngrx/effects @ngrx/store-devtools`, but there is no actual implementation of Effects in the code. There is no creation of effect classes or registration of effects in the AppModule. Effects would typically be used for handling asynchronous operations like API calls, but no effects files or implementations are provided in the answer.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
- **Fail** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
  
  The answer does not include any Angular services. In Angular applications, services are typically used to handle data operations, business logic, and to share functionality across components. The code puts all logic directly in the components and uses only the store for state management without dedicated services for operations like data persistence or business rules.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
  
  The answer does not mention or implement any change detection strategies. In Angular, it's often recommended to use OnPush change detection strategy for improved performance, especially for components that don't change frequently. None of the components in the solution specify a change detection strategy.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs
- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules
  
  The answer does not implement lazy loading for feature modules. In Angular applications, especially larger ones, it's recommended to use lazy loading to improve initial load time. The provided code loads all components eagerly through the main AppModule, and there are no feature modules defined that could be lazy-loaded through the router.
