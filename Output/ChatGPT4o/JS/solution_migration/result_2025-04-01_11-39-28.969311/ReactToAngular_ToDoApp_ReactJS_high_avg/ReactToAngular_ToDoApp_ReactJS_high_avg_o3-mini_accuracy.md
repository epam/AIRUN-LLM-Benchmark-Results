# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The answer shows a migration plan targeting Angular 14.x and uses Angular CLI commands along with Angular module conventions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The code imports and uses @ngrx/store (e.g., in AppModule and throughout the state management files).

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  Although the installation of @ngrx/effects is mentioned, there is no observable implementation or usage of effects in the provided code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  The answer includes well-formed actions, a reducer using createReducer/on, and multiple selectors to manage and query state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  All components are decorated correctly (e.g., @Component, with @Input for passing data and @Output for event handling).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  The TodoComponent correctly replaces React refs with Angular’s @ViewChild.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  Both the TodoItemComponent and FooterComponent use @Input and @Output appropriately to manage data and events.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  There is no dedicated Angular service for handling data or business logic; instead, utility functions and NgRx are used. The evaluation step expected the use of Angular services for some data/business logic separation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  The components and store usage leverage Angular’s dependency injection (e.g., the Store is injected in constructors).

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  The code does not indicate the use of explicit change detection strategies (e.g., OnPush) in components. While the default strategy would work, the evaluation explicitly required applying change detection strategies where appropriate.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  The AppRoutingModule is defined and correctly sets up routing for the TodoComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code is modular and adheres to common Angular conventions, including file structure and naming.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  The application defines and uses TypeScript interfaces (e.g., Todo interface) and type annotations consistently.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  All component templates are provided in Angular HTML, fully replacing any JSX syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  Event handling is managed via Angular’s (event) binding syntax (e.g., (keydown), (change), and (click)).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  There are no leftover TODO comments or markers in the code.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  The application uses a single AppModule with routing but does not demonstrate lazy loading for feature modules.
