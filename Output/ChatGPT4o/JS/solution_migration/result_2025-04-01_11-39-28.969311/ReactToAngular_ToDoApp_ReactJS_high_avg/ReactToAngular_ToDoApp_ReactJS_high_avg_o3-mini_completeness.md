# Evaluation Report

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The provided Angular code renders the todo list using an *ngFor directive in the template (in todo.component.html). This ensures that all todo items, as obtained from the NgRx selector (selectVisibleTodos), are displayed correctly.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The code defines an addTodo() method in TodoComponent. It listens for the Enter key on the input field, validates the input, and dispatches an action to add a new todo item.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  The implementation includes a toggle() method in the TodoItemComponent that dispatches a toggleTodo action. This action correctly inverts the completion status of the selected todo.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent provides methods (edit, save, and cancel) for editing a todo item. This allows users to update the todo title, and the updated title is dispatched using the saveTodo action.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  The destroy() method in TodoItemComponent dispatches a destroyTodo action allowing users to delete a todo, which is then filtered out in the reducer.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  The TodoComponent template includes a checkbox that, when toggled, triggers the toggleAll() method. This method dispatches the toggleAll action to set all todos to either complete or incomplete.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  Filtering is implemented through NgRx actions and selectors. The FooterComponent dispatches setFilter actions, and the selector (selectVisibleTodos) correctly filters todos based on the selected filter criteria.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The footer component template binds to an activeCount input property, which is computed via an NgRx selector (selectActiveCount). This accurately displays the count of active (incomplete) todos.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The FooterComponent template includes a "Clear completed" button that triggers the clearCompleted event. This is handled by TodoComponent to dispatch the clearCompleted action, and the reducer filters out completed todos accordingly.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  In the NgRx reducer functions, after any update to the state, the updated todos list is stored to local storage (using Utils.store). Thus, persistence of todo items is maintained.

- **Fail (100%)**: Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The routing configuration only provides a default route ('') and a wildcard redirect, which means that filtering or other navigation states are not reflected in the URL. In many TodoMVC implementations, the active filter (e.g., "active" or "completed") is shown in the URL. This Angular migration does not preserve that aspect of the original URL structure.

- **Pass (90%)**: Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  The template in TodoComponent uses an *ngIf directive to conditionally display the main section (which includes the list of todos) only when there is at least one todo in the observable. While there is no specialized message for an empty state, hiding the main list when there are no todos is an acceptable approach.  
  (Confidence is 90% because some implementations may expect additional empty-state messaging.)

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  Handling of the form submission (i.e., adding a todo when the Enter key is pressed) is correctly implemented in the TodoComponent’s addTodo method, ensuring proper validation and event handling.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The application is well modularized: the AppComponent hosts the TodoComponent, which in turn uses TodoItemComponent and FooterComponent. Data flows correctly through @Input and @Output bindings and state management via NgRx.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  The migration covers all critical functions such as adding, editing, deleting, toggling individual or all todos, filtering, and local storage persistence, thereby preserving the original application’s business logic.
