# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])
- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed

    The code implements lifecycle hooks such as `OnInit` in the `TodoAppComponent` and `OnChanges` in the `TodoFocusDirective`. However, there might be other lifecycle hooks like `OnDestroy` that could be useful for cleanup but aren't shown in all components where they might be needed (for subscription management).

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models

    The code references a `Todo` interface/model, but the full definition of this model is not shown in the provided code. However, it is referenced and used throughout the application code.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions
- **Pass** (80%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings

    While the code appears to be well-structured with no obvious issues that would cause errors, we can't fully verify this without running the application. The evaluation is based on the quality of the provided code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design
