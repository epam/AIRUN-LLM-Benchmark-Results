# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The answer clearly states the migration to Angular 14.x and makes use of Angular CLI commands (ng new) that, by context, imply Angular 14 usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
  The migration replaces RequireJS with ES modules by using Angular CLI, which handles module loading with native ES modules.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
  The provided code includes the use of @ngrx/store in the actions, reducer, and selectors, confirming that state management is implemented via NgRx.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
  NgRx Effects are demonstrated with the TodoEffects class using createEffect, which handles side effects as required.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
  The answer provides complete code examples for actions (todo.actions.ts), reducers (todo.reducer.ts), selectors (todo.selectors.ts), and effects (todo.effects.ts) focused on managing todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
  The TodoStorageService is correctly decorated with @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }), ensuring it is injectable.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
  localStorage is used both in the TodoStorageService and within NgRx effects to persist the todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
  All components (todo-app, todo-header, todo-list, todo-item, todo-footer) are shown to use the @Component decorator correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
  Both custom directives (todo-focus.directive.ts and todo-escape.directive.ts) are correctly annotated with the @Directive decorator.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
  The templates in the components properly use Angularâ€™s structural directives such as *ngFor and *ngIf.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
  Event bindings (e.g., (click)) are used correctly in components like todo-header, todo-item, and todo-footer.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
  The code demonstrates proper property binding in the todo-item component (e.g., [class.completed]) to manage CSS classes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
  Lifecycle hooks such as ngOnInit in components and ngOnChanges in directives are implemented appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
  The code refers to a Todo model (imported from '../../models/todo.model') which indicates that TypeScript interfaces or classes are in use for data models.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
  All constructors that require services (e.g., Store in multiple components and TodoStorageService) correctly use Angular's dependency injection.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code is organized into clearly defined modules, components, services, and directives, adhering to recommended Angular style practices.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
  The provided code appears complete and follows best practices, so it is expected to run without console errors. However, without executing the code, there is a slight uncertainty (hence 90%) that no runtime or build warnings may occur.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
  The code demonstrates proper usage of TypeScript features, such as type definitions for function parameters, return types (inferred from well-formed NgRx actions and reducers), and usage of interfaces.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
  The answer does not include any commented-out or placeholder (TODO) code, maintaining clarity and cleanliness in the examples.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows the single responsibility principle in component design  
  Each part of the application (components, services, directives, store management) has a well-defined, single responsibility, facilitating maintainability and testability.
