# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list  
  The provided code contains a TodoListComponent that renders the list of todos using an *ngFor directive.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos  
  The TodoHeaderComponent is present and implements an input field along with an addTodo() method to dispatch the action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos  
  The TodoItemComponent includes methods for editing (editTodo, doneEditing, cancelEditing) and an input field that shows up when editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos  
  The TodoFooterComponent includes filter links (using routerLink) that allow switching among All, Active, and Completed views.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics  
  The TodoFooterComponent renders the count of remaining todos using a selector and binding it in the template.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos  
  The addTodo functionality is implemented in the TodoHeaderComponent with proper action dispatching.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos  
  Editing is handled in the TodoItemComponent where the editing state and corresponding actions (updateTodo) are managed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos  
  The TodoItemComponent includes a deleteTodo() method that dispatches the deleteTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed  
  The TodoItemComponent toggles the completed status through an input checkbox and dispatches an updateTodo action.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)  
  While the UI provides filter links via routerLink directives, there is no explicit filtering logic shown (such as a selector or pipe filtering the todo list based on status). This means that although the routes are updated, the actual list of todos is not filtered by the selected category.  
  Explanation: The routing setup is present, but the TodoListComponent always selects all todos without applying a filter to display only Active or Completed items. This suggests a gap in the implementation of filtering functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete  
  The TodoListComponent includes a toggleAll() method that dispatches an action to mark all todos complete or incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos  
  The TodoFooterComponent provides a button that dispatches the clearCompleted action, removing completed todos from the list.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos  
  The remaining todo count is derived with a selector (selectRemainingCount) and displayed in the footer.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage  
  Persistence is implemented in the TodoEffects and TodoStorageService where todos are stored in localStorage after changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization  
  The loadTodos action in the reducer retrieves todos from localStorage, ensuring that persisted data is loaded when the application starts.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing  
  The TodoEscapeDirective listens for the Escape key and emits an event that the TodoItemComponent uses to cancel editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo  
  The TodoFocusDirective is applied to the editing input field, ensuring it is focused when editing is initiated.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original  
  The provided templates closely mimic the structure and class names (such as header, main, footer, etc.) of the original TodoMVC design.  
  Explanation: While the markup suggests consistency with the original design, actual visual appearance verification depends on CSS styling, which is assumed to be in place based on Angular CLI defaults and provided class names.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately  
  Both in the TodoHeaderComponent and within the editing logic in TodoItemComponent, checks are implemented (using trim()) to ensure that empty or whitespace-only titles are handled properly (e.g., by not adding or deleting a todo).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter  
  The routing configuration and the use of routerLink in the TodoFooterComponent ensure that when a filter is selected, the URL updates accordingly (e.g., to '/', '/active', or '/completed').
