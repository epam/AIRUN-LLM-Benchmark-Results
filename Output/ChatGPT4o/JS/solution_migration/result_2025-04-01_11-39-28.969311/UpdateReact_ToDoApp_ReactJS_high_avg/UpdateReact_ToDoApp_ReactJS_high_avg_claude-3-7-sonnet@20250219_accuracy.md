# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all React imports use React 18.x compatible syntax
  
  The answer shows React 18 syntax with `createRoot` from `react-dom/client` instead of the older `ReactDOM.render`. Also, proper imports for hooks like `useState`, `useCallback`, `useRef`, and `useEffect` are included.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all components use functional component syntax with hooks instead of class components
  
  All components in the provided code (`App`, `TodoList`, `TodoItem`, `Footer`) are implemented as functional components using React.FC typing and hooks.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Redux Toolkit's createSlice is used for state management
  
  Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` is properly used in `todosSlice.ts` to define all todo actions and reducers.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for all props, state, and Redux store
  
  TypeScript interfaces are defined for todos (`ITodo`), component props (`Props`), and Redux store types (`RootState`, `AppDispatch`).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses immutable state updates in reducers
  
  The code uses Redux Toolkit's built-in immer functionality to handle immutable updates properly. Operations like `state.push()` appear to mutate the state but are actually handled by immer behind the scenes. Return statements are used correctly when creating new arrays.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that nanoid is used for ID generation instead of custom UUID implementation
  
  The code correctly imports and uses nanoid: `import { nanoid } from 'nanoid';` and applies it in the prepare callback of the addTodo reducer.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application uses React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate
  
  `React.memo` is correctly applied to components that benefit from memoization: `TodoList`, `TodoItem`, and `Footer`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that useCallback is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  
  `useCallback` is consistently used for event handlers throughout the codebase, such as in `handleKeyDown`, `handleToggleAll`, `handleEdit`, etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage handling is implemented in a modern way
  
  LocalStorage is properly implemented with error handling in a utility module (`utils/storage.ts`).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows consistent naming conventions throughout the application
  
  The code maintains consistent naming conventions for interfaces (prefixed with I), component props, and Redux actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper error handling is implemented where necessary
  
  Error handling is implemented for localStorage operations using try/catch blocks.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware
  
  The Redux store is configured correctly using `configureStore`, which automatically sets up the Redux DevTools extension and adds the recommended middleware.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure that React.lazy is used for code splitting where appropriate
  
  While the answer mentions `React.lazy` as an optional technique in the performance optimizations section, it doesn't actually implement it in the provided code. The implementation should have shown code splitting for at least one component to fully satisfy this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the codebase has no TODOs remaining
  
  The codebase doesn't contain any TODO comments and is presented as a complete solution.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux Provider wraps the application entry point
  
  The Redux Provider correctly wraps the App component in the index.tsx file.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure strict TypeScript type checking is implemented throughout the application
  
  The code uses strong typing throughout with interfaces, generic types, and explicit type annotations.
