# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The App componentâ€™s input field has an onKeyDown event that checks for the Enter key. If pressed and the field is not empty, it dispatches the addTodo action, successfully creating a new todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The App component computes a filteredTodos array from the state based on the current filter ("all", "active", or "completed") and passes it to the TodoList component, which then displays the list.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  The application includes a "toggle-all" checkbox in the App component that dispatches the toggleAll action, allowing users to mark all todos as complete or incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  In the TodoItem component, there are handlers for toggling (via checkbox), editing (initiated by double-clicking the label), and deleting (via a dedicated button), fulfilling these functionalities.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  The TodoItem component uses the onDoubleClick event on the label to trigger handleEdit, which sets the editing state to true and enables editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  Within the TodoItem component, a keyDown event listener detects the Enter key. When pressed, it calls handleSubmit, which either updates the todo or deletes it if empty, ensuring submission works as intended.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  The TodoItem component listens for the Escape key in its keyDown handler and resets the editText to the original title while canceling the editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  The Footer component displays the number of active (non-completed) todos by counting them in the App component and passing the count correctly to the Footer.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The Footer component renders filter links that allow the user to change the current filter, effectively switching between All, Active, and Completed views.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  The Footer component conditionally renders a "clear-completed" button if any todos are completed, allowing users to remove them.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  The utility functions loadTodos and saveTodos in utils/storage.ts are used in the Redux slice to load and persist todos in localStorage, ensuring persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  The App component conditionally renders UI elements such as the main section and footer based on the length of the todo list and state values, ensuring dynamic UI updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  The Footer component conditionally adjusts the text between "item" and "items" based on the count of active todos, handling singular and plural cases correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The application is composed of functional components such as App, TodoList, TodoItem, and Footer, each responsible for a distinct piece of functionality, promoting modularity.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The provided folder structure clearly separates concerns (app, components, features, utils), demonstrating a well-organized project structure by feature and functionality.
