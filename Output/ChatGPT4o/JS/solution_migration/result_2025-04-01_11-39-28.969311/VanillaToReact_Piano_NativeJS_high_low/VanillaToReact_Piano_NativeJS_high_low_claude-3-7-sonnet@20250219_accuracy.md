# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration
    
    The code includes the command `npx create-react-app virtual-piano --template typescript` for project creation and uses React 18 features like `ReactDOM.createRoot()` in the index.tsx file, confirming it's using React 18 with TypeScript.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure
    
    TypeScript interfaces are properly used throughout the application. The code defines types and interfaces in `src/types/index.ts` including `Note` and `PianoKeyData`. The `Piano` component also uses proper TypeScript typing for the audio mapping with `useRef<Map<Note, HTMLAudioElement>>(new Map())`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks
    
    All components (Piano, PianoKey, ToggleButtons, App) are implemented as functional components using the React.FC type annotation and utilize hooks like useState and useEffect appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)
    
    The code uses appropriate React hooks for state management:
    - `useState` for tracking active notes (`activeNotes`), display preferences (`showLetters`)
    - `useEffect` for side effects like setting up event listeners and audio initialization
    - `useRef` for maintaining reference to audio elements across renders

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels
    
    Keyboard event handlers are properly implemented in the Piano component using `useEffect` to add and remove event listeners for keydown and keyup events. The handlers are defined at the appropriate level (Piano component) which manages the audio playback.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events
    
    Mouse interactions are properly implemented using React synthetic events:
    - `onMouseDown` and `onMouseUp` in the PianoKey component
    - `onMouseLeave` in PianoKey for handling mouse exit
    - `onMouseMove` in the Piano component for dragging functionality

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment
    
    Audio resources are properly handled using the Audio API within the React environment. The code initializes audio elements in a useEffect hook and stores them in a useRef Map to persist across renders. The playback is controlled appropriately when notes are activated/deactivated.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility
    
    Fullscreen functionality is implemented using standard Web APIs (`requestFullscreen` and `exitFullscreen`) within a React event handler function (`toggleFullscreen`). The code also handles browser compatibility with optional chaining (`?.`).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns
    
    Conditional class application is handled properly using the `classNames` package, which is a common React pattern. This is used in all components, such as:
    ```tsx
    className={classNames('piano-key', {
      sharp,
      none: disabled,
      'piano-key-active': isActive,
      letters: showLetters,
    })}
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate
    
    Performance optimization is implemented with `React.memo` for the PianoKey component, which is appropriate since this component will be rendered multiple times as part of the piano keyboard and only needs to re-render when its specific props change.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations
    
    Audio playback is handled with proper React lifecycle considerations:
    - Audio elements are initialized in a useEffect hook
    - References to audio elements are maintained with useRef to avoid re-creation
    - Audio playback state is managed correctly with React state
    - Cleanup is handled appropriately

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application
    
    The code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application:
    - Custom types defined for Note and PianoKeyData
    - Component props are defined with interfaces
    - Event handlers are properly typed
    - Non-null assertion (`
