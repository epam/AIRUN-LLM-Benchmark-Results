# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration  
  The code shows the use of ReactDOM.createRoot (a React 18 feature) and instructions to create the project using the TypeScript template of Create React App.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure  
  The project does define several TypeScript types (such as the union type Note and the interface PianoKeyData), but it does not include a dedicated TypeScript interface for the audio mapping structure. Instead, the code uses a generic Map<Note, HTMLAudioElement> constructed inline via useRef. This means the audio mapping is not formally defined with its own interface.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks  
  Every component (Piano, PianoKey, ToggleButtons, and App) is written as a functional component and makes use of React hooks like useState and useEffect where appropriate.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)  
  The Piano component properly manages state with useState (for activeNotes and showLetters) and employs useEffect to handle side effects such as adding and removing event listeners.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels  
  The keyboard events (keydown and keyup) are handled on the document level within the Piano component, which is appropriate for this type of global interaction.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events  
  The code uses React’s synthetic event system by assigning onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseLeave, and onMouseMove props to relevant elements.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment  
  Audio elements are cached in a useRef Map and are created within a useEffect hook. The playNote function correctly resets the audio time and plays the sound without repeated reloading of the audio files.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility  
  The toggleFullscreen function utilizes optional chaining (doc.requestFullscreen?.() and document.exitFullscreen?.()) to handle browser compatibility. Although the implementation is straightforward, it reasonably follows React patterns through its use in an onClick handler.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns  
  Conditional class application is effectively handled by the classNames library in both the PianoKey and ToggleButtons components.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate  
  The PianoKey component is wrapped with React.memo to avoid unnecessary re-renders, which is a suitable optimization for this scenario.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations  
  Audio playback is managed within the component’s lifecycle: audio objects are loaded in useEffect and there is cleanup of event listeners on component unmount. Although the current implementation meets the requirements, one might consider additional error handling for audio loading difficulties.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application  
  The project demonstrates strong typing with TypeScript for components, props, and state. While most parts are strictly typed, a few instances (e.g., event type assertions in mouse event handlers) could be further refined to enhance type safety.
