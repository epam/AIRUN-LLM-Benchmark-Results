# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'.  
  The header is implemented in the Piano component with an h1 element containing "Virtual Piano".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons.  
  The ToggleButtons component renders two buttons, one labeled "Notes" and one labeled "Letters", using a button container.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys).  
  The Piano component maps through the whiteKeys and blackKeys arrays to render natural keys and sharp keys respectively.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes.  
  The PianoKey component includes the data attributes "data-note" and "data-letter" to identify each key.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked.  
  The code uses a Map to cache audio elements from the `/assets/audio/` directory and plays the corresponding audio file when a key is activated.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed).  
  The PianoKey component conditionally applies the "piano-key-active" class based on the activeNotes state, ensuring that pressed keys are visually highlighted.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes.  
  The Piano component adds event listeners for "keydown" and "keyup" events to trigger playNote and stopNote functions based on the key letter.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked.  
  The ToggleButtons component and the corresponding state update in the Piano component handle the toggle functionality between showing notes and letters.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes.  
  A toggleFullscreen function is implemented in the Piano component using requestFullscreen and exitFullscreen for toggling fullscreen mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly.  
  The application maintains an activeNotes array to allow multiple keys to be active concurrently. Each key is checked independently, enabling simultaneous playback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys.  
  The onMouseMove event handler in the Piano component detects dragging while holding the mouse button down (using e.buttons) and plays the appropriate note.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information.  
  The footer is rendered in the Piano component with a div containing the text "2020".
