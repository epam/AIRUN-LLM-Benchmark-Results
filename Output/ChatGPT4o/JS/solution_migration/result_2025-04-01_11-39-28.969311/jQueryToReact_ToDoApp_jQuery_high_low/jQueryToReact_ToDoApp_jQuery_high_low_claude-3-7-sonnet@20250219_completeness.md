# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos
  
  The Header component (`src/features/todos/Header.tsx`) includes an `h1` with "todos" and an input field with the class "new-todo" that allows creating new todos by keyboard input.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos
  
  The TodoList component (`src/features/todos/TodoList.tsx`) includes a section with class "main" that contains both a toggle-all checkbox input and a `ul` element with class "todo-list" for displaying todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button
  
  The TodoItem component (`src/features/todos/TodoItem.tsx`) renders each todo with a checkbox (class "toggle"), a label for displaying the title, and a delete button (class "destroy").

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode
  
  In the TodoItem component, the label element has an `onDoubleClick={handleEdit}` event handler that sets the editing state to true, which renders an input field for editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The footer component (`src/features/todos/Footer.tsx`) includes filter links for "All", "Active", and "Completed". The AppRouter and Redux slice handle the filtering logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization
  
  The Footer component includes a span with class "todo-count" that displays the number of active items with proper pluralization: `<strong>{activeCount}</strong> {activeCount === 1 ? 'item' : 'items'} left`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter
  
  The Footer component renders filter links with a "selected" class conditionally applied based on the current filter state: `className={filter === f ? 'selected' : ''}`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist
  
  The Footer component conditionally renders a "Clear completed" button only when there are completed todos: `{completedCount > 0 && (<button className="clear-completed" ...`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter
  
  In the Header component, the input field has a `handleKeyDown` event handler that checks for the Enter key and dispatches the `addTodo` action when pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos
  
  The TodoItem component includes a checkbox that dispatches the `toggleTodo` action when clicked: `onChange={() => dispatch(toggleTodo(todo.id))}`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once
  
  The TodoList component includes a toggle-all checkbox that dispatches the `toggleAll` action: `onChange={(e) => dispatch(toggleAll(e.target.checked))}`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management
  
  The TodoItem component handles editing with an input that gets focus automatically (`autoFocus`), and includes proper keyboard event handling for Enter and Escape keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos
  
  The TodoItem component includes a delete button that dispatches the `deleteTodo` action: `onClick={() => dispatch(deleteTodo(todo.id))}`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos
  
  The Footer component includes a "Clear completed" button that dispatches the `clearCompleted` action when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status
  
  The TodoList component filters todos based on the current filter: `const filteredTodos = todos.filter((todo) => { if (filter === 'active') return !todo.completed; if (filter === 'completed') return todo.completed; return true; });`
