# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Vite is configured as the build tool with appropriate configuration files  
  The project includes a "vite.config.ts" file configured with the necessary Vite settings and plugins, and the package.json scripts ("dev", "build", "preview") appropriately invoke Vite.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm TypeScript is properly configured with a tsconfig.json file containing correct compiler options  
  The provided tsconfig.json has modern and strict compiler options that are suitable for a production-ready React + TypeScript project.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the React setup includes necessary entry points and proper component structure  
  The project has a clear entry point in "src/main.tsx" and a well-organized component structure, including "App.tsx", route definitions, and separate component files.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that Redux is implemented with appropriate store configuration, reducers, and actions  
  Redux is properly implemented using Redux Toolkit. The store is configured in "src/app/store.ts" with a counter reducer, and actions are defined in "counterSlice.ts".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify React Router is correctly configured with defined routes and navigation components  
  The project uses React Router v6 appropriately with routes defined in "src/routes/AppRoutes.tsx" and a BrowserRouter wrapping the App in the entry point.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure testing libraries are properly configured with appropriate test setup files  
  Testing is set up with Vitest and React Testing Library. The presence of "vitest.setup.ts" along with sample test cases in "Counter.test.tsx" confirms proper configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate package.json includes correct dependencies with compatible version specifications  
  The package.json lists all the required dependencies (with versions for React, Redux Toolkit, React Router, etc.) and the devDependencies necessary for testing, linting, and formatting.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm package.json contains scripts for development, building, and testing operations  
  The provided scripts in package.json include "dev", "build", "preview", "test", "lint", and "format", covering all required operations for a modern project.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the project structure follows modern React development conventions  
  The directory structure is organized with clear separation of concerns (public assets, source code, configuration files) and adheres to modern best practices in React development.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that configuration files are production-ready with appropriate optimization settings  
  The configuration files, including Vite, ESLint, and Prettier, are set up to support production-ready optimization and code quality. The Vite config also includes testing settings that align with best practices.
