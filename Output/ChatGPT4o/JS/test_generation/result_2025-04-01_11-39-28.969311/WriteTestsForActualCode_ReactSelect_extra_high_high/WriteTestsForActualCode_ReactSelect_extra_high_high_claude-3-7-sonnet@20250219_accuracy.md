# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up in the test file
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test cases are properly isolated and do not have interdependencies
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that DOM events are simulated using proper React Testing Library methods
  
- **Pass** (100%): Validate that accessibility attributes are being tested appropriately
  
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure mocks are used for external dependencies where appropriate
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of async/await for asynchronous testing where needed
  
- **Pass** (100%): Check that all assertions use appropriate Jest matchers
  
- **Fail** (95%): Verify that tests include proper cleanup after each test case
  
  While most test practices are excellent, there's no explicit cleanup mentioned using `afterEach` or React Testing Library's built-in cleanup utilities. The cleanup is likely happening automatically with React Testing Library's default configuration, but it's not explicitly shown in the code samples provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test descriptions clearly indicate what functionality is being tested
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the test file follows best practices for organizing test cases (describe/it blocks)
  
- **Pass** (100%): Validate that all event handlers are tested using appropriate simulation methods
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the test environment correctly simulates both mouse and keyboard interactions
  
- **Fail** (90%): Ensure tests for touch events properly simulate mobile interactions
  
  While the answer shows awareness of touch capabilities by mocking `isTouchCapable`, there are no specific tests that validate touch event handling for mobile interactions. A comprehensive test suite should include explicit tests for touch interactions to ensure the component behaves correctly on mobile devices.
