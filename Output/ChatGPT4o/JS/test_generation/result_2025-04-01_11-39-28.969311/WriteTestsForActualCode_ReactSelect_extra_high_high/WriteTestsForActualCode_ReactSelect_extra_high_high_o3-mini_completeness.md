# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist  
  The test file "Select.render.test.tsx" includes a test that renders the component with default props and checks for the presence of the combobox.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present  
  The provided tests check keyboard interactions using arrow and enter keys (“selects option with keyboard”), but there are no tests for tab or escape key behavior.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)  
  While mouse click interactions (opening the menu, clicking options, clicking clear indicator) are tested, there are no tests that cover hovering interactions.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior  
  The tests consistently supply explicit value props (controlled behavior). There is no separate test verifying how the component behaves when used as an uncontrolled component (i.e. without setting the value prop).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values  
  Tests exist to check that selecting an option updates state ("updates value on selection") and that clicking the clear indicator triggers a state change ("clears value when clear indicator is clicked").

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented  
  There is a test for opening the menu on click, but no test is found verifying the menu closing behavior (for example, closing on outside click or escape key).

- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality  
  The test "filters options based on input" explicitly validates that the component correctly filters options based on user input.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist  
  The test "supports multi-select" simulates multiple selections and confirms that multiple onChange calls are made, verifying multi-select functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility  
  The tests check that ARIA attributes (like aria-label and aria-invalid) are properly applied, and there is an accessibility test using jest-axe.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested  
  The test "renders with empty options" is provided, ensuring that the component handles the case when no options are available.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states  
  There are no tests present that simulate or check for loading indicators or error state rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states  
  The test "disables options correctly" verifies that options marked as disabled have the appropriate ARIA attribute set.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance  
  The performance section includes a test that renders a large set of options to confirm efficient rendering.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested  
  Although one test sets focus on the combobox before interacting, there is no comprehensive test verifying focus management (e.g. focus shifting on menu open/close or after selection).

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering  
  There are no explicit tests checking that placeholders are rendered correctly or that the component properly displays a provided value.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations  
  No tests are provided to validate the behavior of a custom formatOptionLabel function, if such functionality exists.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)  
  Although onChange is tested in several places, the tests do not explicitly verify the behavior of onInputChange, onMenuOpen, or onMenuClose callbacks.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)  
  A test for clear indicator functionality exists, but there are no tests for dropdown indicators or loading states.
