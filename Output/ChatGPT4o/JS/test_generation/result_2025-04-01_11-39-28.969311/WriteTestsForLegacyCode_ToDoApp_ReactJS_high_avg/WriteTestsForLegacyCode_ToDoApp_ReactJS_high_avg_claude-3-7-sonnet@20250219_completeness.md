# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events
- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts
- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation
- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos
- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions
    
    The test file for todoModel.ts does not include any tests for the subscribe and inform functions. These are important functions in the observer pattern implementation that would typically be used to notify components of changes to the model, but there are no tests verifying this functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx
- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering
    
    No test file for app.tsx or main application component is provided in the answer. This is a critical component to test as it would contain the main application logic and component composition.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos
    
    No test file for app.tsx is provided, so there are no tests for adding new todos at the application level.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos
    
    No test file for app.tsx is provided, so there are no tests for toggling all todos at the application level.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos
    
    No test file for app.tsx is provided, so there are no tests for filtering todos at the application level.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
    
    No test file for app.tsx is provided, so there are no tests for clearing completed todos at the application level.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data
    
    The answer does not include any dedicated test fixtures for sample todo data. While there are some todo objects created directly within tests, a proper test fixture would be a separate file or setup that provides consistent sample data across tests.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented
    
    Although the answer mentions mocking the router in the requirements section, there are no actual tests implementing router mocks or testing routing functionality.
