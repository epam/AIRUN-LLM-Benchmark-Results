# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering  
  No test file named "app.tsx" or similar is provided, so tests for rendering in app.tsx are missing.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos  
  The provided answer does not include an "app.tsx" test file or tests for adding new todos.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos  
  There is no test file for app.tsx; thus, tests for toggling all todos at the application level are missing.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos  
  The answer does not include an "app.tsx" test file or tests verifying the filtering functionality of todos.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  There are no tests in an "app.tsx" file covering clearing completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering  
  The "todoItem.test.tsx" file includes a test named "renders correctly" that confirms rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos  
  The "todoItem.test.tsx" file contains tests for toggling the checkbox, destroying an item, and entering edit mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events  
  Tests in "todoItem.test.tsx" check both "enter" and "escape" key events.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts  
  "footer.test.tsx" includes a test that checks rendering of the active count message.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation  
  The tests for filter navigation (highlighting the appropriate filter based on the "nowShowing" prop) are present in "footer.test.tsx".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  "footer.test.tsx" includes a test that verifies the "Clear completed" button is rendered and triggers its callback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos  
  "todoModel.test.ts" includes tests for adding a todo, toggling a todo, saving changes, and destroying a todo.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions  
  The provided tests in "todoModel.test.ts" do not include any tests for subscribe and inform functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  There is a test in "todoModel.test.ts" for the clearCompleted method that confirms only the active todo remains.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation  
  "utils.test.ts" includes a test that validates the UUID generated matches the expected format.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality  
  A test in "utils.test.ts" verifies that the pluralize function works correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations  
  The test for storing and retrieving data from localStorage is present in "utils.test.ts".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function  
  The extend function is tested in "utils.test.ts" and behaves as expected.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx  
  Component tests are named using the .test.tsx extension, and non-component tests use .test.ts which is a common practice. Although the step explicitly mentions .test.tsx, the naming convention appears consistent with standard practices for their respective file types. (Slight uncertainty due to differing extensions, but it meets common conventions.)

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data  
  No dedicated test fixture files or modules for sample todo data are provided; sample data is inlined in the tests.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented  
  Although the setup mentions mocks for routing (in jest.config.js and comments), there are no tests provided that specifically verify routing functionality with appropriate mocks.
