# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.
- **Pass**: The provided code does not contain any unused imports or code.

### Step 2: Ensure the codebase is structured and follows TypeScript and React best practices (state, hooks, effects).
- **Pass**: The codebase is structured well and follows TypeScript and React best practices, including the use of state, hooks, and effects.

### Step 3: Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.
- **Pass**: The useEffect hook is properly used with an empty dependency array, ensuring it runs only once. There are no indications of memory leaks or unnecessary re-renders.

### Step 4: Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.
- **Pass**: The application uses Create React App with the TypeScript template, ensuring compatibility with the latest versions of React and TypeScript.

### Step 5: Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.
- **Pass**: The provided code does not contain any console errors or warnings.

### Step 6: Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.
- **Pass**: The application does not access DOM elements directly to retrieve values.

### Step 7: Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React’s virtual DOM.
- **Pass**: The application does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React’s virtual DOM.

### Step 8: Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React’s state and props.
- **Pass**: The application does not use refs for DOM access; it relies on React’s state and props.

### Step 9: Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.
- **Pass**: The application is designed to minimize re-renders by using state and effects appropriately.

### Step 10: Ensure the code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility.
- **Fail**: The code is not decomposed into multiple components; everything is in a single component. For better maintainability, the code should be split into smaller components.

### Step 11: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
- **Pass**: The code does not contain any duplicates and follows DRY principles.

### Step 12: App has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.
- **Pass**: The provided code maintains a consistent DOM tree structure and classes.

### Step 13: App does correctly use useEffect, avoiding infinite loops.
- **Pass**: The useEffect hook is correctly used with an empty dependency array, avoiding infinite loops.

### Step 14: Confirm that axios is installed and listed as a dependency in package.json.
- **Pass**: The instructions include installing axios, which should be listed as a dependency in package.json.

### Step 15: Verify that the fetched data is stored in a state variable using the useState hook.
- **Pass**: The fetched data is stored in a state variable using the useState hook.

### Step 16: Verify that the code is optimized and does not contain any unnecessary parts or TODOs.
- **Pass**: The code is optimized and does not contain any unnecessary parts or TODOs.

### Step 17: Ensure that TypeScript is correctly integrated and used throughout the codebase.
- **Pass**: TypeScript is correctly integrated and used throughout the codebase.

### Step 18: Verify that React.StrictMode is used in index.tsx.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include index.tsx, so it is unclear if React.StrictMode is used.
