# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Ensure that the application uses `$resource` objects for RESTful API communication.**
   - **Pass**: The provided code mentions the use of the `REST` factory (`rest.js`) which provides a set of `$resource` objects to interact with various backend RESTful API endpoints.

2. **Verify that the application saves page changes to local storage.**
   - **Pass**: The `pageCtrl` controller (`pageCtrl.js`) handles autosaving to local storage, allowing users to recover unsaved changes from a previous session.

3. **Confirm that the application initializes the page type correctly.**
   - **Pass**: The `page.html` file includes a dropdown for selecting the page type, which suggests that the application initializes the page type correctly.

4. **Validate that the application manages local storage for unsaved changes.**
   - **Pass**: The `pageCtrl` controller manages autosaving to local storage and notifies users if there is a newer version of the page available.

5. **Verify that the application handles errors during saving or updating pages.**
   - **Fail**: The provided answer does not mention any specific error handling mechanisms during saving or updating pages.

6. **Confirm that the application broadcasts events to update page variables and settings when necessary.**
   - **Fail**: The provided answer does not mention any specific event broadcasting to update page variables and settings.

7. **Validate that the application uses promises and callbacks for asynchronous operations.**
   - **Fail**: The provided answer does not mention the use of promises or callbacks for asynchronous operations.

8. **Validate that the application broadcasts notifications for various operations (e.g., page saving, updating, deleting).**
   - **Fail**: The provided answer does not mention any specific notifications being broadcasted for various operations.

9. **Verify that the application supports scalability and maintainability through modular design.**
   - **Pass**: The application is designed in a modular way, with separate factories for different entities (e.g., `Page`, `Users`, `REST`), which supports scalability and maintainability.

10. **Confirm that the application optimizes performance through efficient API usage and local storage management.**
    - **Pass**: The use of RESTful APIs for data operations and local storage for autosave suggests efficient API usage and local storage management.

### Summary

- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 10
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 6
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 4

The evaluation reveals that while the application meets several key requirements, there are areas, particularly around error handling, event broadcasting, and the use of promises/callbacks, that need further attention.
