# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Pass**: Confirm that constraints related to local storage limitations are noted.
   - The report mentions that the application relies on `localStorage` for data persistence and notes the size limit of `localStorage` (typically around 5MB).

2. **Pass**: Verify that assumptions about the application being designed for a single user are mentioned.
   - The report clearly states that the application is designed for a single user, as todos are stored locally in the browser.

3. **Pass**: Ensure that browser compatibility assumptions are included.
   - The report mentions that the application assumes the user is using a modern browser that supports `localStorage`.

4. **Pass**: Check that performance-related constraints are noted.
   - The report discusses performance optimizations and constraints, including the use of immutable data structures and `shouldComponentUpdate`.

5. **Pass**: Confirm that performance optimizations, such as the use of `shouldComponentUpdate`, are identified.
   - The report explicitly mentions the use of `shouldComponentUpdate` in the `TodoItem` component to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

6. **Pass**: Verify that considerations for using immutable data structures for performance are mentioned.
   - The report notes the use of immutable data structures (e.g., `map`, `filter`, `reduce`) as a best practice in React for performance and predictability.

7. **Pass**: Ensure scalability considerations related to local storage limitations are discussed.
   - The report discusses the limitations of using `localStorage` for data persistence and its impact on scalability.

8. **Pass**: Check that the potential need for a backend service for better scalability is mentioned.
   - The report mentions that the application is not designed to scale to multiple users or devices and lacks a backend or cloud storage solution.

9. **Pass**: Confirm that the evaluation steps are unambiguous and concise.
   - The evaluation steps are clear, concise, and unambiguous.

10. **Pass**: Ensure that each step allows the evaluator to assess the output based solely on the provided code.
    - Each step is designed to allow the evaluator to assess the output based on the provided code and the report.

11. **Pass**: Verify that the steps are clearly articulated and cover all main points of the task.
    - The steps are clearly articulated and cover all the main points of the task, including constraints, assumptions, performance, and scalability considerations.
