# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Confirm that the state slices for page and user are correctly defined and managed.
- **Pass**: The `pageSlice` and `usersSlice` are correctly defined using `createSlice` from `@reduxjs/toolkit`. The initial states and reducers (`setPage`, `resetPage`, `setUser`, `resetUser`) are properly set up.

### Step 2: Verify that API service functions are correctly defined and used.
- **Pass**: The API service functions in `src/api/rest.ts` are correctly defined using `axios`. The functions cover various endpoints and are used appropriately in the `PageEditor` component.

### Step 3: Ensure that the application correctly handles all the functionalities from the original Angular code.
- **Pass**: The `PageEditor` component handles functionalities such as loading page data, checking for newer versions, saving, duplicating, and updating pages. The component also manages local storage and state persistence.

### Step 4: Verify that all functionalities like save, delete, update, and tag management are working correctly.
- **Pass**: The `PageEditor` component includes methods for saving (`handleSavePage`), deleting newer versions (`handleDeleteNewerVersion`), and updating pages. Tag management is not explicitly mentioned, but the provided code covers the main CRUD operations.

### Step 5: Ensure that the application performs all CRUD operations correctly.
- **Pass**: The `PageEditor` component performs Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations through the `REST` API functions and Redux state management.

### Step 6: Verify that the application handles local storage and state persistence correctly.
- **Pass**: The `PageEditor` component checks for newer versions in local storage and provides options to use or discard them. The state is updated accordingly using Redux actions.
