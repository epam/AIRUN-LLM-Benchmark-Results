# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Confirm that the application initializes correctly and loads persisted todos.
- **Pass**: The application initializes correctly and loads persisted todos from localStorage using the `TodoEffects` class.

### Step 2: Ensure that the todo list displays correctly and is interactive.
- **Pass**: The todo list displays correctly and is interactive. The `TodoListComponent` uses `*ngFor` to display todos and binds actions to UI events.

### Step 3: Verify that adding a new todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: Adding a new todo works correctly. The `TodoHeaderComponent` dispatches the `addTodo` action, and the `todoReducer` updates the state accordingly.

### Step 4: Check that editing a todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: Editing a todo works correctly. The `TodoItemComponent` handles the editing logic and dispatches the `editTodo` action to update the state.

### Step 5: Confirm that toggling a todo item’s completion status works correctly.
- **Pass**: Toggling a todo item’s completion status works correctly. The `TodoItemComponent` dispatches the `toggleTodo` action, and the `todoReducer` updates the state.

### Step 6: Ensure that removing a todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: Removing a todo works correctly. The `TodoItemComponent` dispatches the `removeTodo` action, and the `todoReducer` updates the state.

### Step 7: Verify that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works.
- **Pass**: The "Mark all as complete" functionality works. The `TodoListComponent` dispatches the `markAllTodos` action, and the `todoReducer` updates the state.

### Step 8: Check that the filter functionality (All, Active, Completed) works.
- **Fail**: The filter functionality does not work correctly. The `selectFilteredTodos` selector expects `props` to filter todos, but `props` is not provided in the component.

### Step 9: Confirm that the "Clear completed" button works correctly.
- **Pass**: The "Clear completed" button works correctly. The `TodoFooterComponent` dispatches the `clearCompletedTodos` action, and the `todoReducer` updates the state.

### Step 10: Ensure that the application is responsive and functions correctly on different screen sizes.
- **Pass**: The application is responsive and functions correctly on different screen sizes. The CSS from `todomvc-common/base.css` and `todomvc-app-css/index.css` ensures responsiveness.

## Summary

- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 10
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 9
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 1

The application is mostly functional, but the filter functionality needs to be fixed to correctly filter todos based on the selected filter (All, Active, Completed).
