# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Verify the application contains a button container with "Notes" and "Letters" buttons.
- **Pass**: The application contains a button container with "Notes" and "Letters" buttons as seen in the `App.tsx` file.

### Step 2: Verify the application renders piano keys for both natural and sharp notes.
- **Pass**: The application renders piano keys for both natural and sharp notes. Natural notes are rendered with `data-note` attributes like `c`, `d`, `e`, etc., and sharp notes with `data-note` attributes like `c♯`, `d♯`, etc.

### Step 3: Verify clicking on a piano key plays the correct sound and highlights the key.
- **Pass**: Clicking on a piano key plays the correct sound and highlights the key. The `play` function handles this by adding the `piano-key-active` class and playing the corresponding audio.

### Step 4: Verify releasing the mouse button or moving the cursor out of the key stops the sound and removes the highlight.
- **Pass**: Releasing the mouse button or moving the cursor out of the key stops the sound and removes the highlight. The `resetActive` function handles this by removing the `piano-key-active` class.

### Step 5: Verify pressing and releasing keyboard keys play and stop the corresponding piano notes.
- **Pass**: Pressing and releasing keyboard keys play and stop the corresponding piano notes. This is managed by the `handleKeyDown` and `handleKeyUp` event listeners in the `useEffect` hook.

### Step 6: Verify clicking the "Notes" button displays note names on the keys.
- **Pass**: Clicking the "Notes" button displays note names on the keys. The `changeMode` function toggles the `isLettersMode` state, which affects the class of the piano keys.

### Step 7: Verify clicking the "Letters" button displays letter names on the keys.
- **Pass**: Clicking the "Letters" button displays letter names on the keys. The `changeMode` function toggles the `isLettersMode` state, which affects the class of the piano keys.

### Step 8: Verify the fullscreen button toggles fullscreen mode for the application.
- **Pass**: The fullscreen button toggles fullscreen mode for the application. The `toggleFullscreen` function handles this by using the `requestFullscreen` and `exitFullscreen` methods.

### Step 9: Verify the application correctly handles simultaneous multiple key presses.
- **Pass**: The application correctly handles simultaneous multiple key presses. The `play` function checks if the note is already played and only plays it if it is not in the `played` state.
