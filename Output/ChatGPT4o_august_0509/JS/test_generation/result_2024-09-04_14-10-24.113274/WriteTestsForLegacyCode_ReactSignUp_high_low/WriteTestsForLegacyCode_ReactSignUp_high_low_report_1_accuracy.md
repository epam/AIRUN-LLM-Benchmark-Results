# Evaluation Report

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Check that the tests are isolated and do not depend on each other.**
   - **Pass**: Each test case is self-contained and does not rely on the state or outcome of other tests. The `beforeEach` function ensures that mocks are cleared before each test.

2. **Validate that the tests adhere to best practices for unit testing.**
   - **Pass**: The tests are well-structured, focusing on individual components and their behavior. They use `render`, `fireEvent`, and `waitFor` from `@testing-library/react` to simulate user interactions and verify outcomes.

3. **Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.**
   - **Pass**: The code avoids duplication by using helper functions like `setup` to render components. This keeps the tests DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

4. **Verify that the testing environment is set up correctly.**
   - **Pass**: The `package.json` file includes necessary dependencies and scripts for running tests, indicating a correctly set up testing environment.

5. **Check if a testing library for JavaScript (such as Jest) has been chosen.**
   - **Pass**: Jest is used as the testing library, as indicated by the `jest` dependency and the `test` script in `package.json`.

6. **Validate that dependencies are mocked where necessary, such as API calls.**
   - **Pass**: API calls are mocked using `jest.mock`, ensuring that tests do not make real network requests and are isolated from external dependencies.

7. **Verify that the test coverage for the code is at least 80%.**
   - **Fail**: The provided information does not include test coverage reports. Therefore, it is not possible to verify if the test coverage is at least 80%.

8. **Confirm that the package.json file includes necessary dependencies and scripts for running tests.**
   - **Pass**: The `package.json` file includes necessary dependencies like `jest`, `@testing-library/react`, and `redux-mock-store`, as well as a script to run tests with coverage.

9. **Confirm that the tests use the proper methods and assertions from the chosen testing library.**
   - **Pass**: The tests use appropriate methods and assertions from `@testing-library/react` and `jest`, such as `render`, `fireEvent`, `waitFor`, and `expect`.

### Summary

- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 9
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 8
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 1

The overall evaluation indicates that the tests are well-written and adhere to best practices, with the exception of the missing test coverage report.
