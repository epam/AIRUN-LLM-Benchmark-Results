# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps:

1. **Confirm that constraints related to local storage limitations are noted.**
   - **Pass**: The answer mentions "Single-user local storage model" and "Uses HTML5 localStorage for data persistence," which indicates awareness of local storage constraints.

2. **Verify that assumptions about the application being designed for a single user are mentioned.**
   - **Pass**: The answer explicitly states "Single-user local storage model," confirming the single-user assumption.

3. **Ensure that browser compatibility assumptions are included.**
   - **Pass**: The answer includes "Assumes modern browser support," addressing browser compatibility assumptions.

4. **Check that performance-related constraints are noted.**
   - **Pass**: The answer discusses performance optimizations and constraints, such as "Uses immutable data structures" and "Implements `shouldComponentUpdate` for performance optimization."

5. **Confirm that performance optimizations, such as the use of `shouldComponentUpdate`, are identified.**
   - **Pass**: The answer explicitly mentions "Implements `shouldComponentUpdate` for performance optimization."

6. **Verify that considerations for using immutable data structures for performance are mentioned.**
   - **Pass**: The answer states "Uses immutable data structures," indicating consideration for performance.

7. **Ensure scalability considerations related to local storage limitations are discussed.**
   - **Fail**: The answer does not explicitly discuss scalability considerations related to local storage limitations.

8. **Check that the potential need for a backend service for better scalability is mentioned.**
   - **Fail**: The answer does not mention the potential need for a backend service for better scalability.

9. **Confirm that the evaluation steps are unambiguous and concise.**
   - **Pass**: The evaluation steps are clear and concise.

10. **Ensure that each step allows the evaluator to assess the output based solely on the provided code.**
    - **Pass**: Each step is designed to assess the output based on the provided answer.

11. **Verify that the steps are clearly articulated and cover all main points of the task.**
