# Evaluation Report

## Step-by-Step Evaluation

### Step 1: Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.
**Pass**: All imports are used in the provided code.

### Step 2: Ensure the codebase is structured and follows React best practices (state, hooks, effects).
**Pass**: The codebase is well-structured, using hooks and state management appropriately.

### Step 3: Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.
**Pass**: The use of `useCallback` in `PageEditor` helps prevent unnecessary re-renders.

### Step 4: Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.
**Pass**: The code uses React 18.x and TypeScript.

### Step 5: Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.
**Pass**: There are no apparent console errors or warnings in the provided code.

### Step 6: Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.
**Pass**: The app uses React state to manage input values.

### Step 7: Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React virtual DOM.
**Pass**: There is no direct DOM manipulation outside of React's virtual DOM.

### Step 8: Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React state and props.
**Pass**: The app does not use refs for DOM access.

### Step 9: Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.
**Pass**: The use of `useCallback` and local state management helps minimize re-renders.

### Step 10: Ensure the code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility.
**Pass**: The code is decomposed into multiple files and components, each with a single responsibility.

### Step 11: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
**Pass**: The code follows DRY principles and does not contain duplicates.

### Step 12: App does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.
**Pass**: This step is a duplicate of Step 6 and has already been passed.

### Step 13: App has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.
**Pass**: The provided code maintains the same structure as the original Angular application.

### Step 14: Ensure that the store is properly configured and provided to the app.
**Pass**: The store is configured using Redux Toolkit and provided to the app.

### Step 15: Verify that the code is migrated to React 18.x.
**Pass**: The code is migrated to React 18.x.

### Step 16: Check that TypeScript is used in the translated code.
**Pass**: TypeScript is used throughout the code.

### Step 17: Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for managing local data.
**Pass**: Redux Toolkit with `createSlice` is used for managing local data.

### Step 18: Ensure that the code is split into separate components.
**Pass**: The code is split into separate components.

### Step 19: Validate that the code does not contain any TODOs.
**Pass**: There are no TODOs in the provided code.

### Step 20: Check that the code is optimized.
**Pass**: The code is optimized and follows best practices.
