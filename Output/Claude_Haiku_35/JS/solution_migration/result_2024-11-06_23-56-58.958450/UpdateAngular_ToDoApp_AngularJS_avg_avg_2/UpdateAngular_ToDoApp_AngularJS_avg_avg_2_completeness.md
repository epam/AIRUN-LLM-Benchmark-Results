# Evaluation Report

## Step-by-Step Evaluation

### Step 1: Confirm that the application initializes correctly and loads persisted todos.
- **Pass**: The `TodoEffects` class includes an effect (`loadTodos$`) that loads todos from `localStorage` when the `loadTodos` action is dispatched. This ensures that persisted todos are loaded when the application initializes.

### Step 2: Ensure that the todo list displays correctly and is interactive.
- **Pass**: The `TodoListComponent` correctly subscribes to the `todos$` observable from the store and displays the list of todos. The template includes the necessary HTML structure to display the todo list interactively.

### Step 3: Verify that adding a new todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `addTodo` method in `TodoListComponent` dispatches the `addTodo` action with the new todo's title and completion status. The `todoReducer` handles this action and adds the new todo to the state.

### Step 4: Check that editing a todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItemComponent` includes methods for starting and finishing the editing of a todo. The `finishEditing` method dispatches the `updateTodo` action with the updated todo details, and the `todoReducer` updates the state accordingly.

### Step 5: Confirm that toggling a todo item completion status works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `toggleTodo` method in `TodoItemComponent` dispatches the `updateTodo` action with the toggled completion status. The `todoReducer` updates the state to reflect the new completion status.

### Step 6: Ensure that removing a todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `removeTodo` method in `TodoItemComponent` dispatches the `removeTodo` action with the todo's ID. The `todoReducer` handles this action and removes the todo from the state.

### Step 7: Verify that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works.
- **Pass**: The `toggleAll` method in `TodoListComponent` dispatches the `toggleAllTodos` action with the desired completion status. The `todoReducer` updates the state to mark all todos as complete or incomplete.

### Step 8: Check that the filter functionality (All, Active, Completed) works.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include any implementation for filtering the todos based on their status (All, Active, Completed). The `TodoListComponent` template includes links for the filters, but there is no logic to filter the displayed todos.

### Step 9: Confirm that the "Clear completed" button works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `clearCompleted` method in `TodoListComponent` dispatches the `clearCompletedTodos` action. The `todoReducer` handles this action and removes all completed todos from the state.

### Step 10: Ensure that the application is responsive and functions correctly on different screen sizes.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include any CSS or responsive design considerations. There is no information about how the application behaves on different screen sizes.

## Summary

- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 10
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 8
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 2

Overall, the implementation covers most of the required functionalities, but it lacks the filter functionality and responsive design considerations.
