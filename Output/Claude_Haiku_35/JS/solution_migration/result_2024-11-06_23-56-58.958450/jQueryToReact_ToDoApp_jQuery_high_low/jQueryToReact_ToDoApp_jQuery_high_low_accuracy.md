   - **Pass**: No unused imports or code found.

2. **Ensure the codebase is structured and follows React best practices (state, hooks, effects).**
   - **Pass**: The codebase is well-structured and follows React best practices.

3. **Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.**
   - **Pass**: No memory leaks or unnecessary re-renders detected.

4. **Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.**
   - **Pass**: The application uses React 18.x and TypeScript 5.x, which are the latest versions.

5. **Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.**
   - **Pass**: No console errors or warnings found.

6. **Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.**
   - **Pass**: The app uses React state to manage text field values.

7. **Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React virtual DOM.**
   - **Pass**: No direct DOM manipulation found.

8. **Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React state and props.**
   - **Pass**: Refs are used appropriately, mainly for focusing input fields.

9. **Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.**
   - **Pass**: The app is optimized to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

10. **Ensure the code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility.**
    - **Pass**: The code is decomposed into components with single responsibility.

11. **Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.**
    - **Pass**: No duplicate code found, and DRY principles are followed.

12. **Verify app does not make API calls.**
    - **Pass**: No API calls are made in the app.

13. **Verify that the codebase does not contain any TODOs.**

14. **Ensure that the code is split into separate components.**
    - **Pass**: The code is split into separate components.

15. **Verify app does clean up timers, subscriptions, or event listeners in `useEffect`.**
    - **Pass**: No timers, subscriptions, or event listeners found that need cleanup.

16. **App has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.**
    - **Pass**: The DOM tree structure and classes match the original application.

17. **Verify that the codebase is written in TypeScript.**
    - **Pass**: The codebase is written in TypeScript.

22. **Confirm that the store configuration file uses Redux Toolkit.**
    - **Pass**: The store configuration file uses Redux Toolkit.

23. **Verify that the application uses `createSlice` from Redux Toolkit to define actions and reducers for adding, toggling one and all, editing, deleting, clearing completed, and filtering TODO items.**
    - **Pass**: The application uses `createSlice` from Redux Toolkit for these actions and reducers.

24. **Confirm the use of `nanoid` for generating unique IDs.**
    - **Pass**: `nanoid` is used for generating unique IDs.

25. **Check that the code includes a `Provider` wrapping the entire application.**
    - **Pass**: The code includes a `Provider` wrapping the entire application.
