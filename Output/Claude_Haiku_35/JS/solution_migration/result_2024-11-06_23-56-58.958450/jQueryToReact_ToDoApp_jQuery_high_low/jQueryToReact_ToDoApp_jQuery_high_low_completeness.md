# Evaluation Report

## Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
**Pass**: The `TodoHeader` component includes an input field with the class `new-todo`. The `handleSubmit` function listens for the Enter key press and dispatches the `addTodo` action with the trimmed value from the state.

## Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
**Pass**: The `TodoList` component uses the `useSelector` hook to get the `todos` and `filter` from the state. It filters the todos based on the current filter and maps over the filtered todos to display them using the `TodoItem` component.

## Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
**Pass**: The `TodoHeader` component includes a checkbox with the class `toggle-all`. The `onChange` event of this checkbox dispatches the `toggleAllTodos` action with the negated value of `allCompleted`.

## Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
**Pass**: The `TodoItem` component includes a checkbox for toggling the completion status, a label for editing on double-click, and a button for deleting the todo. The corresponding actions (`toggleTodo`, `updateTodo`, `deleteTodo`) are dispatched appropriately.

## Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
**Pass**: The `TodoItem` component handles double-clicking to start editing, pressing Enter to submit the edited value, and pressing Esc to reset the editing state to the initial value. The `handleDoubleClick`, `handleBlur`, and `handleKeyDown` functions manage these interactions.

## Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
**Pass**: The `TodoFooter` component displays the count of active items, includes filter links for 'all', 'active', and 'completed', and has a button to clear completed items. The `clearCompletedTodos` action is dispatched when the button is clicked.

## Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
**Pass**: The `TodoFooter` component includes a button with the class `clear-completed` that dispatches the `clearCompletedTodos` action when clicked.
