# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies Angular.js as the framework used  
  The documentation clearly states that it is an Angular.js module and refers to Angular-specific terminology such as controllers and factories.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all factories (REST, Page, Users) are accurately documented with their purposes  
  The documentation provides a table for the REST factory endpoints and explains the roles of the Page and Users factories (global state management and authorship tracking, respectively), which is accurate.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of the Page controller and its functionality is technically accurate  
  The document includes a comprehensive table of scope variables and explains how the controller initializes page data, handles form inputs, and integrates with the Page factory.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the RESTful API endpoints are correctly documented  
  The REST Factory Resources table lists endpoints, methods, and corresponding resource descriptions that match common RESTful practices in a CMS context.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure that the explanation of Angular module dependencies ($resource, $location, etc.) is correct  
  While the documentation mentions $location and provides usage examples for navigation, it does not explicitly explain other Angular dependencies like $resource. This omission leads to a partial explanation.  
  (I am 90% confident because $location is mentioned, but the full spectrum of Angular module dependencies is not addressed.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the page management features (creating, editing, deleting) are accurately described  
  The documentation clearly details the workflows for creating, editing, and deleting pages, including user interactions and confirmation processes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately explains how the local storage mechanism works  
  The explanation of the auto-save functionality, restoration, and deletion of local page versions is clear and technically sound.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of form validation logic is technically accurate  
  The documentation notes that required fields are validated before saving, which is technically consistent with common practices in Angular forms, even though detailed code is not provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of publish/schedule date handling is correct  
  The documentation accurately explains the three-state publishing system (immediate, draft, schedule) and mentions that a scheduled publish requires a specific date/time.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the tag management and autocomplete feature explanation is technically accurate  
  The description correctly notes that tags are managed via an array, integrated with a REST API for suggestions, and support real-time autocomplete, which is technically accurate.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the relationship between controllers, factories, and templates is accurately explained  
  The documentation outlines how the Page Editor integrates Angular services, controllers, and RESTful factories to manage different aspects of content, indicating a sound understanding of their relationships.

- **Fail** (100%): Check that the documentation correctly identifies and explains the purpose of broadcast events  
  There is no mention of broadcast events in the documentation. Since broadcast events can be an important aspect of Angular.js communication between components, their omission means this step has failed.
