  The provided tables explicitly include a “Required” column indicating whether each prop is mandatory.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component's state management approach is accurately documented  
  The documentation presents state properties for components (e.g., nowShowing, editing for TodoApp) clearly with explanations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that sample code snippets demonstrate proper implementation of the components  
  The usage examples include clear, well-structured code snippets showcasing basic implementation and extensions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation explains all ARIA roles and attributes implemented in the components  
  The "ARIA Implementation" section outlines semantic HTML elements, label associations, and other accessibility features.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation describes how the components support assistive technologies
