# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x
  
  The component uses modern React hooks (useState, useRef, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) that are compatible with React 18.x. The import statement `import React, { useState, useRef, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';` also indicates it's using a recent version of React.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
  
  The code uses TypeScript with proper type definitions throughout. There are explicit interfaces defined for props (`SearchableSelectProps`) and options (`SelectOption`). Types are provided for all refs (e.g., `useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)`), and the component is declared as a React functional component with proper typing: `React.FC<SearchableSelectProps>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling
  
  The component includes an `index.css` file that contains comprehensive styling for the component, including hover states, focus states, and dark mode support.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments
  
  The code is clean, well-structured, and doesn't contain any TODO comments or unfinished sections. The implementation is complete and ready for production use.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility
  
  The component uses appropriate React state management with useState hooks for:
  - `isOpen` to manage dropdown visibility
  - `searchTerm` to manage the search input
  - `highlightedIndex` to track the currently highlighted option

  It also properly derives state using useMemo for `selectedOption` and `filteredOptions`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props
  
  The component accepts a variety of props to customize its behavior and appearance:
  - `options` for the dropdown options
  - `value` for the currently selected value
  - `onChange` callback for handling selection changes
  - `placeholder` for the default text
  - `disabled` to disable the component
  - `label` for an associated label
  - `id` for custom element IDs
  - `className` for additional CSS classes

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection
  
  The component implements comprehensive keyboard navigation with handlers for:
  - Arrow keys to navigate through options
  - Enter to select an option or open the dropdown
  - Escape to close the dropdown
  - Space to open the dropdown
  
  The handlers are properly implemented using `useCallback` for performance optimization.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions
  
  The component follows best practices with properly typed refs (`containerRef`, `inputRef`, `listboxRef`) and uses them appropriately for focus management and DOM interactions. DOM interactions are handled through React's event system rather than direct DOM manipulation when possible.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques
  
  The component includes proper focus management:
  - Automatically focuses the search input when dropdown opens
  - Returns focus to the input/button when dropdown closes
  - Handles focus trapping within the component
  - Provides visual indicators for focused elements
  - Scrolls the highlighted option into view when navigating with keyboard

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
  
  The component uses appropriate ARIA attributes throughout:
  - `role="combobox"`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-haspopup`, `aria-controls` for the input/button
  - `role="listbox"` for the dropdown
  - `role="option"`, `aria-selected` for the options
  - `aria-activedescendant` to indicate the currently active option
  - `aria-label` for screen reader descriptions
  - `aria-hidden` for decorative elements

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  The code appears free of potential console errors or warnings. It properly handles edge cases like empty option lists, undefined values, and keyboard navigation boundaries.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component
  
  The component optimizes renders using:
  - `useCallback` for event handlers to prevent unnecessary recreation
  - `useMemo` for derived state like `selectedOption` and `filteredOptions`
  - Appropriate dependency arrays in hooks to avoid excessive re-computation
  - Clean conditional rendering patterns
