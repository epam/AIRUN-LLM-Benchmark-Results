# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  Although the component is written with modern React hooks and TypeScript, there is no explicit indication (such as version-specific imports or features) confirming itâ€™s tied solely to React 18.x. It is likely implemented with React 18.x, but without version-locked features, the confidence is slightly below 100%.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  The code is provided in .tsx files and makes extensive use of TypeScript interfaces (such as SelectOption and SearchableSelectProps) as well as proper type annotations for props and hooks.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  An "index.css" file is provided with comprehensive styling, including layout, theming, and dark mode support.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  The code is clean, well-organized, and contains no TODO comments or residual development code.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  State is managed using useState for dropdown open/closed state, search term, and highlighted index, with selected item inferred from props. This setup is appropriate for handling component state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  The component accepts several customizable props (options, value, onChange, placeholder, disabled, label, id, className), which makes it flexible and reusable in different contexts.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  Keyboard navigation is robustly implemented. The code handles Enter, Escape, ArrowDown, and ArrowUp keys via onKeyDown event handlers for both the input and button elements.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  The use of refs (containerRef, inputRef, listboxRef) and hooks (useEffect for handling outside clicks, useCallback for event handlers) follows established best practices in React.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  Focus is managed appropriately: the input receives autoFocus when opened; focus is returned to the input when the dropdown is closed; and proper roles are provided via ARIA attributes to facilitate accessible focus management.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  The component includes a comprehensive set of ARIA attributes (role="combobox", role="listbox", aria-expanded, aria-controls, aria-activedescendant, and aria-selected) that support accessibility and assistive technology.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  There is no obvious faulty code that would trigger console errors or warnings. However, without runtime testing, we assume correctness based on the static analysis, hence a 90% confidence.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  The code utilizes useMemo and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders. While the implementation appears efficient, fine-tuning of dependencies and further profiling might be required in a production environment, resulting in a 90% confidence.
