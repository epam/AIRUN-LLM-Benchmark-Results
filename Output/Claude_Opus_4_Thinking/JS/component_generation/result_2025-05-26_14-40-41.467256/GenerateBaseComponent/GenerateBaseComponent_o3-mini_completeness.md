# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component renders a container div with class "searchable-select" alongside a button or an input element that, when active, displays a dropdown (<ul>) containing selectable options.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  When the dropdown is open (isOpen is true), the component renders an <input> element with type "text" that allows the user to enter search terms.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The component uses the onChange callback to handle selections, and the design only allows one value (a single selected value) to be passed back via this callback.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  Keyboard event handlers for ArrowDown and ArrowUp are implemented to adjust the highlightedIndex, allowing proper navigation of the dropdown options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  The onKeyDown handler checks for the "Enter" key and, if an option is highlighted when the dropdown is open, triggers the selection of that option.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  The code appropriately calls handleOpen when "Enter" is pressed (either on the input or button when not open), thereby toggling the dropdown’s visibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  In the handleClose callback, after closing the dropdown, the focus is programmatically set back to the inputRef, ensuring the select component regains focus.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  Each option’s onClick event calls handleSelect, which in turn calls handleClose, thereby closing the dropdown after an item is clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  When selecting an option via keyboard (using Enter), the handleSelect function is invoked, which calls handleClose to close the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  The onKeyDown handler for the input element intercepts the "Escape" key and calls handleClose, ensuring the dropdown is closed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  An event listener attached to the document monitors mousedown events, and if a click occurs outside the component (based on the container ref), handleClose is triggered.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  When the component is focused and the Enter key is pressed (in either the button or input state), handleOpen is called to open the dropdown.
