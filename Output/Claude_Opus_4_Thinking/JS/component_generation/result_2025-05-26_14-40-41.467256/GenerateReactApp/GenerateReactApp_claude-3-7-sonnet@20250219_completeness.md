# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The application fetches Star Wars characters from the SWAPI API (`https://swapi.dev/api/people`) in the `App.tsx` component using axios and displays them through the `CharacterList` component when the data is loaded.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The application includes a loading spinner that appears while data is being fetched. The relevant code in `App.tsx` shows a loading container with a spinner animation when the `loading` state is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The application maps over the entire `characters` array received from the API and renders each character in the UI through the `CharacterList` component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  The application code doesn't contain any search input fields or search functionality. It simply displays the fetched character data without any filtering capabilities.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character's name is displayed prominently in the character card as shown in the `CharacterList` component with the line: `<h3 className="character-name">{character.name}</h3>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The application structure, including the package.json configuration, directory organization, and build scripts, matches the standard Create React App structure. The installation instructions also explicitly mention using Create React App.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The `App.tsx` component properly manages three state variables using the useState hook:
  - `characters` for storing the fetched character data
  - `loading` for tracking the loading state
  - `error` for capturing and displaying any error messages

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each character card in the list is given a unique key based on the character's URL:
  `<div key={character.url} className="character-card">`, which ensures proper React reconciliation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  The application has conditional rendering that handles different states appropriately:
  - Shows a loading spinner when loading
  - Displays an error message with a retry button when there's an error
  - Only renders the character list when data is available and not in a loading or error state
