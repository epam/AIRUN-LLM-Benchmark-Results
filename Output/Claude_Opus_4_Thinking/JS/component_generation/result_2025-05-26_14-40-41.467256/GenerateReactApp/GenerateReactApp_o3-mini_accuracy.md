# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses React 18.x or newer by checking the package.json dependencies  
  The package.json specifies "react": "^18.2.0" and "react-dom": "^18.2.0", confirming usage of React 18.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that TypeScript is properly implemented with appropriate type definitions for all components, props, and states  
  All components and state variables are strictly typed. Dedicated type definition files (e.g., swapi.types.ts) are provided to ensure type safety throughout the codebase.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Axios is used for API requests to fetch data from the Star Wars API endpoint  
  The App component uses Axios with the GET method to fetch data from the provided SWAPI endpoint, ensuring that the API is being queried properly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles API errors gracefully with appropriate error states or messages  
  A try-catch block in the fetchCharacters function handles errors by setting an error state, and a user-friendly error message along with a retry button is rendered.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the character data is fetched on component mount using the useEffect hook  
  The useEffect hook is used with the dependency on the fetchCharacters function, ensuring that the data is fetched as soon as the component mounts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application properly manages component rendering optimization  
  The CharacterList component is wrapped in React.memo to avoid unnecessary re-renders, and useCallback is used for the API fetching function, demonstrating a focus on performance optimization.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows React best practices using hooks appropriately  
  The implementation leverages best practices with hooks like useState, useEffect, and useCallback in a manner consistent with modern React development.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't contain any TODO comments or unnecessary code  
  There are no extraneous TODO comments or dead code fragments; all code present directly relates to implementing the required functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the codebase has minimal comments that only clarify complex logic when necessary  
  Comments are used sparingly and only to provide clarity where needed, maintaining a clean and professional codebase.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the API endpoint 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' is being called correctly  
  The constant SWAPI_PEOPLE_URL is correctly set to 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' and is used in the axios.get request, ensuring accuracy in the API call.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application renders without console errors or warnings  
  The code is structured appropriately for a production-ready React application, and there are no indications of errors or warnings that would surface during runtime.
