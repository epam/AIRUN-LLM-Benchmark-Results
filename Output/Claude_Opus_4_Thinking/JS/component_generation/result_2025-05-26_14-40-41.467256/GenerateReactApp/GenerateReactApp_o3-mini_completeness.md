# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The App component fetches data from SWAPI and passes the results to the CharacterList component, which maps each character into a UI card.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The code displays a loading spinner along with a “Loading characters…” message when data is being fetched.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  All characters from the API response are stored in the state and rendered via the CharacterList component without filtering.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  There is no search bar or input field for filtering characters. The only interactive element is the retry button for error recovery, which is intended for handling errors rather than performing searches. This subtle difference keeps the core functionality free from search inputs.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each character card displays the name prominently (inside an h3 element), along with additional details.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The provided project instructions and file structure correspond with a typical Create React App (with the TypeScript template) setup.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The App component utilizes React useState hooks to manage loading, error, and character data, and uses useEffect and useCallback for API handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  Each character item is assigned a unique key using the character’s URL, which is expected to be unique.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  While the code renders the CharacterList component based on the character array, it does not explicitly handle or provide feedback for an empty list scenario (for example, showing a message if no characters are returned). This might lead to a confusing UI if the API returns an empty dataset.  
  (I am 90% confident in this evaluation as some applications may consider an empty list as acceptable, but ideally an explicit message would improve the user experience.)
