# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The code includes a SearchInput component with an onChange handler that updates the search query and fetches results based on the search term.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  The render logic checks the loading state and, when true, displays a spinner and a "Loading characters..." message.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  The useEffect hook calls fetchCharacters (with no search term) on component mount, ensuring initial data is loaded.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  The search input’s onChange triggers a debounced call to fetchCharacters, ensuring that as users type, the search query updates the displayed results dynamically.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  If no characters are found (i.e. characters array is empty), the UI displays a clear message stating that no characters match the search query.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The accompanying CSS includes media queries and responsive styling rules, ensuring the search component (and the overall layout) adapts to different screen sizes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  The character list is rendered by mapping over the fetched characters, ensuring the proper display of search results upon API response.

- **Pass** (80%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  The code handles API errors by catching exceptions, setting an error state, and displaying an error message with a retry button. However, note that this implementation handles errors in the data fetching process rather than using React’s dedicated Error Boundary (componentDidCatch) for rendering issues. This slight deviation leads to an 80% confidence level.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The code defines interfaces for Character, APIResponse, and SearchInputProps, which are used throughout the components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The original functionality (loading characters on mount) is preserved while the search functionality has been seamlessly added, ensuring no regression in core application behavior.
