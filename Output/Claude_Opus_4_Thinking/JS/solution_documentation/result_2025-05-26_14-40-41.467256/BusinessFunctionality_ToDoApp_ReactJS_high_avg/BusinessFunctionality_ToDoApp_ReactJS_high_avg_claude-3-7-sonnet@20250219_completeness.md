# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers all main functionality including adding, editing, deleting, and toggling todos
  
  The document thoroughly covers these core functionalities in Section 1 (Main Functionality and Features) and elaborates further in Section 2 (User Interaction Patterns).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about filtering todos by status (all, active, completed)
  
  The document clearly describes filtering functionality in multiple sections, including the core features list (point 4), the component relationships diagram, and the user interaction patterns section.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the user workflow for creating new todo items
  
  Section 2 (User Interaction Patterns) explicitly describes the process: "Focus is automatically set on the input field, Type task description and press Enter to add, Empty tasks are ignored, Input field clears after successful addition."

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the editing functionality triggered by double-clicking
  
  The document clearly states in Section 2 that users can "Double-click on any task to enter edit mode" and details the various ways to save or cancel edits.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the clear completed functionality
  
  This functionality is mentioned both in the main functionality list (point 6: "Cleanup Features: Clear all completed tasks with a single action") and in the footer components section ("Clear Completed Button").

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the toggle all functionality
  
  The toggle all functionality is described in multiple places, including the components diagram ("Toggle All Checkbox"), the User Interaction Patterns section ("Use 'Mark all as complete' checkbox for bulk operations"), and the bulk operations feature.
