# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props
  
  The submitted code consistently uses TypeScript with proper type definitions throughout. All components, hooks, and functions have explicit type annotations, including proper prop interfaces for React components (e.g., `PageFormProps`, `ActionBarProps`, `NewerVersionAlertProps`).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management
  
  The code correctly implements Redux Toolkit with `createSlice` for state management. The store is configured using `configureStore`, and multiple slices are defined (pageSlice, userSlice, uiSlice) with appropriate reducers and actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components
  
  All components in the submitted code are implemented as functional components using the React.FC type annotation. For example:
  ```typescript
  const PageEditor: React.FC = () => {...}
  const PageForm: React.FC<PageFormProps> = ({...}) => {...}
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately
  
  The code demonstrates appropriate usage of React hooks throughout. For example, `useState` for local state, `useEffect` for side effects, `useCallback` for memoized callbacks, and custom hooks like `usePageLocalStorage` are all implemented correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource
  
  The code uses the native `fetch` API for all HTTP requests in the `ApiService` class, replacing Angular's `$resource`. The implementation includes proper error handling and supports all CRUD operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components
  
  All form elements in the code are implemented as controlled components. Input values are bound to state variables, and onChange handlers are provided to update the state when the user interacts with the inputs.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation
  
  React Router v6 is correctly implemented with `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, and `Route` components. The code also uses hooks like `useParams`, `useLocation`, and `useNavigate` for programmatic navigation and route parameter access.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization
  
  The code implements internationalization using `i18next` along with `react-i18next` for React integration and `i18next-browser-languagedetector` for language detection. Translations are organized in a resources object and the `useTranslation` hook is used throughout the components.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization
  
  Code splitting is implemented using React's lazy loading with `React.lazy()` and `Suspense` in the App.tsx file:
  ```typescript
  const PageEditor = React.lazy(() => import('./components/PageEditor/PageEditor'));
  // ...
  <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations
  
  `React.memo` is correctly applied to all appropriate components to optimize rendering performance, including `PageEditor`, `PageForm`, `ActionBar`, and `NewerVersionAlert`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks
  
  All `useEffect`, `useCallback`, and other hooks in the code have proper dependency arrays. For example:
  ```typescript
  useEffect(() => {
    if (notification) {
      const timer = setTimeout(() => {
        dispatch(hideNotification());
      }, 5000);

      return () => clearTimeout(timer);
    }
  }, [notification, dispatch]);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models
  
  TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models in the application, including `Page`, `User`, `ApiResource`, `Notification`, and various state interfaces like `PageState`, `UserState`, and `UIState`.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state
  
  The code correctly uses Redux selectors through the custom hooks `useAppSelector` and `useAppDispatch`. For example:
  ```typescript
  const page = useAppSelector(state => state.page.currentPage);
  const newerVersion = useAppSelector(state => state.page.newerVersion);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations
  
  Action creators are properly implemented using Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` and `createAsyncThunk` for async operations. The actions are exported and used throughout the application, such as:
  ```typescript
  export const { updatePageField, setCurrentPage, setNewerVersion, setSuggestions, resetPage } = pageSlice.actions;
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks
  
  Local storage functionality is implemented using custom hooks - `useLocalStorage` and `usePageLocalStorage`. These hooks provide a clean API for reading from and writing to localStorage, including error handling.
