# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented
  
  The code implements all required page management functionality through the Redux actions in `pageSlice.ts` and the UI components in `PageEditor.tsx`. The `savePage` thunk handles both create and update operations, while `deletePage` handles deletion. The duplicate functionality is implemented via the `handleSavePage(true)` function in the PageEditor component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present
  
  Page type selection is implemented in the PageForm component with a select dropdown that maps over `page.themePages` to generate options. The selected value updates the Redux store via the `onFieldChange` handler.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists
  
  The URL auto-generation from title is implemented in the `handleTitleChange` function in PageEditor.tsx. When the title changes, it converts the title to a URL-friendly format by replacing spaces with hyphens and removing special characters, then sets it as the URL if `autoURL` is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented
  
  Tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented with:
  1. Input for entering tags in PageForm
  2. `handleTagsInput` to parse comma-separated tags
  3. `fetchTagSuggestions` thunk to fetch tag suggestions
  4. Rendering of suggestions with click handlers to select them
  5. `handleSelectSuggestion` to handle selection of a suggestion

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available
  
  The publish status options are implemented in the PageForm component with three radio buttons for "Publish" (Y), "Draft" (N), and "Schedule" (schedule).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented
  
  Scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented in the PageForm component. When the "Schedule" option is selected, a datetime-local input appears for selecting the publication date and time. The handleSavePage function in PageEditor also handles the logic for determining if a scheduled page should be published if the schedule date has passed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present
  
  Local storage version comparison and restoration features are implemented through:
  1. The `usePageLocalStorage` custom hook
  2. The `checkForNewerVersion` function to detect newer versions
  3. The `NewerVersionAlert` component to notify users of newer versions
  4. The `handleRestoreVersion` and `handleDeleteNewerVersion` functions to restore or delete the local version

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented
  
  The notification system is implemented through:
  1. The `notification` state in the uiSlice
  2. The `showNotification` and `hideNotification` actions
  3. The `NotificationContainer` component to display notifications
  4. Usage of notifications throughout the application for success/error messages

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present
  
  Form validation for required fields is implemented in the `handleSavePage` function in PageEditor.tsx. It checks if the page type is selected and if the URL is provided and not equal to "new". If validation fails, it shows appropriate error notifications.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled
  
  The API endpoints are properly handled in the `services/api.ts` file. The ApiService class provides methods for CRUD operations, and all the endpoints from the original code are exported, including blocks, content, contentExtras, contentRevisions, etc.

- **Fail** (70%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented
  
  While the interfaces and API services for extras are defined (contentExtras, contentRevisionsExtras), there is no specific UI component or functionality in the provided code that allows users to manage the "extras" field of a page. The interface defines `extras: Record<string, any>`, but there's no specific implementation for editing these extras.

- **Fail** (80%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained
  
  The API services for content revisions are defined (contentRevisions, contentRevisionsExtras), but there is no specific UI component or functionality in the provided code for viewing or restoring revisions. The deletePage function does delete revisions from the API, but there's no UI for viewing or managing them.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components
  
  The code is well-organized into feature folders:
  1. `/types` for type definitions
  2. `/store` for Redux store, slices, and hooks
  3. `/services` for API services
  4. `/hooks` for custom hooks
  5. `/components` for UI components
  
  Business logic is separated from UI components, with Redux slices handling state management and thunks handling async operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved
  
  Translation functionality is preserved using react-i18next. The i18n.ts file sets up the internationalization, and components use the useTranslation hook to access translations. All text in the UI components uses the t function for translation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters
  
  The application maintains the same URL structure with routes for "/new" and "/:url" as defined in App.tsx. The useParams hook is used to extract the URL parameter, and navigation is handled with the useNavigate hook.
