# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props  
  All React components, hooks, and Redux slices include explicit TypeScript types and interfaces. Component props and state are properly typed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management  
  The code uses Redux Toolkitâ€™s createSlice to define multiple slices (pageSlice, userSlice, uiSlice) for state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components  
  All components (e.g., PageEditor, PageForm, ActionBar, NotificationContainer) are implemented as functional components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately  
  The code utilizes useState, useEffect, useCallback, and even React.memo where appropriate, ensuring proper optimization and state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource  
  The API service implementation uses fetch for communicating with endpoints.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components  
  The form elements (inputs, textareas, selects) in PageForm are controlled components with their values managed by state via Redux actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation  
  The App component sets up React Router with BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route, effectively managing navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization  
  The code uses i18next with the react-i18next integration to handle internationalization.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization  
  Code splitting is implemented via React.lazy and Suspense in the App component, ensuring improved performance.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations  
  Components like PageEditor, PageForm, ActionBar, and NewerVersionAlert are wrapped in React.memo to optimize rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks  
  The useEffect hooks include proper dependency arrays to avoid unnecessary re-renders and potential bugs.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models  
  Interfaces for Page, User, ApiResource, Notification, and others are defined and used throughout the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state  
  The useAppSelector hook is consistently used for safely accessing state slices in various components.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations  
  The Redux slices define clear action creators (e.g., updatePageField, setCurrentPage, setUser) to mutate state appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks  
  Custom hooks (useLocalStorage and usePageLocalStorage) are implemented to manage local storage functionality effectively.
