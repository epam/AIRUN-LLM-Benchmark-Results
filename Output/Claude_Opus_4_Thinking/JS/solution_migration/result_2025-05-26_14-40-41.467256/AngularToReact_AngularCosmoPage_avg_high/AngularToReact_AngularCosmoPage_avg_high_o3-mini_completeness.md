# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
  All CRUD operations are covered via the Redux slices and API services (savePage, deletePage, duplicate handling). There is clear support for page creation, updating, deletion, and duplication.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
  The PageForm component includes a select element for choosing the page type, reflecting the expected functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
  The PageEditor component implements auto-generation of the URL based on the title using a callback (handleTitleChange) that processes the title input.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
  Tag management is implemented: tags can be entered, suggestions are fetched via dispatch(fetchTagSuggestions) and displayed, and the user can select a suggestion.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
  Radio buttons for "Publish", "Draft", and "Schedule" are present in the PageForm component, enabling the selection of different publish statuses.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
  The code includes scheduling logic in both the PageEditor (updating scheduleDate) and PageForm (datetime-local input) to handle scheduled publishing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
  The custom hook usePageLocalStorage provides functions to check for a newer version, save to localStorage, restore, and clear entries, thus implementing the version restoration feature.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
  The NotificationContainer component, along with Redux actions like showNotification and hideNotification, ensures that notifications are shown for different outcomes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
  In the handleSavePage function, validations are performed for critical fields like URL and page type, with notifications for missing information.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
  The API service in services/api.ts maps all endpoints (e.g., content, contentExtras, contentRevisions, etc.), ensuring that the original code's API endpoints are maintained.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
  The Page interface includes the extras field and the Redux state initialization for pages incorporates extras. The implementation leaves room for managing additional data as per the original code.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
  The deletePage thunk calls API methods for revisions (contentRevisions and contentRevisionsExtras), thereby preserving the revision history functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
  The project structure separates Redux slices, API services, hooks, and UI components into distinct folders, following a clear organizational pattern.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
  The i18n setup and usage of react-i18next in components ensure that translations are maintained across the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
  Routing is implemented with Routes for '/new' and '/:url', preserving the URL structure from the original Angular application.
