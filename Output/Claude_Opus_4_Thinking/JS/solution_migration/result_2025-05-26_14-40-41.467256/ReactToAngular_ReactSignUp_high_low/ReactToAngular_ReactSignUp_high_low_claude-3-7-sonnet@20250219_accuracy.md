# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling
  
  The component clearly imports FormBuilder, FormGroup, and other reactive forms classes from @angular/forms, and implements a reactive form approach with FormGroup and FormControl objects.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)
  
  The form validation is properly implemented in the createForm method with Validators.minLength(3) and Validators.maxLength(60) for name, Validators.email for email, and Validators.minLength(6) for password.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use
  
  The component correctly implements async validators with nameAsyncValidator and emailAsyncValidator methods that call the API service to check if name and email are already in use.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched
  
  The FormGroupComponent handles displaying validation feedback with appropriate CSS classes (has-error, has-success, has-feedback) based on the control state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions
  
  The onSubmit method properly calls apiService.signup and dispatches AuthActions.signupComplete with the user data upon successful signup.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails
  
  Error messages are displayed using the getErrorMessage method and shown via FormGroupComponent's template that renders help-block elements.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service
  
  The component correctly injects the Title service and sets the page title in ngOnInit using the getTitle utility function.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management
  
  While the component uses @ngrx/store to dispatch actions (AuthActions.signupComplete), there's no evidence of @ngrx/effects being used in the provided code. The effects implementation is missing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress
  
  The submit button includes [disabled]="submitting || signupForm.invalid" which correctly disables it during form submission.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses
  
  The subscription to the signup API call includes both next and error handlers, with proper error handling that sets form control errors based on server responses.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management
  
  The component implements OnInit and OnDestroy correctly, properly cleans up subscriptions using the destroy$ Subject, and follows Angular's component architecture guidelines.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises
  
  While the ApiService correctly uses HttpClient for API calls, the async validators in the SignupComponent convert observables to promises with .toPromise() which is deprecated. They should use observables throughout.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements
  
  The getErrorMessage method returns the appropriate error messages for each field, matching the requirements for validation feedback.
