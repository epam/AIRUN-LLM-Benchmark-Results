# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The component imports and uses FormBuilder to create a FormGroup and ReactiveFormsModule is imported in the module.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The form group definition includes Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3) and Validators.maxLength(60) for the name field, Validators.email for the email field, and Validators.minLength(6) for the password field.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  Both the name and email form controls have asynchronous validators (nameAsyncValidator and emailAsyncValidator) that call the API service methods to check for existing values.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The app-form-group component uses getters (showError, showSuccess, hasFeedback) to conditionally apply CSS classes for error/success states, and the error message is rendered when appropriate.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  The onSubmit() method calls the API service’s signup function and dispatches the signupComplete action upon a successful response.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The getErrorMessage() method returns specific error messages for each field, and the template displays these messages using the form-group component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  In ngOnInit(), the titleService sets the title using the getTitle helper function, where the title becomes “Signup - PodBaby”.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The component imports and dispatches actions using @ngrx/store. Although there is no direct reference to @ngrx/effects within the component, it is common practice for effects to be implemented outside the component logic. This step passes based on the assumption that effects are handled elsewhere in the application.  
  Explanation: The component correctly uses @ngrx/store, and dispatching actions intended to be intercepted by effects is a typical architecture even though effects are not directly visible in this component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button’s disabled attribute is bound to "submitting || signupForm.invalid", ensuring it is disabled during submission.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  The onSubmit() method subscribes to the signup API call, handling the success case by dispatching an action and the error case by setting form control errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component implements OnInit and OnDestroy properly, uses a destroy$ Subject to manage subscriptions, and separates concerns using helper methods.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The ApiService utilizes Angular's HttpClient to make API calls returning Observables. Although the async validators convert Observables to Promises using toPromise(), which is a valid (if now deprecated) approach in some Angular versions, it remains a supported pattern.  
  Explanation: Converting Observables to Promises in async validators is acceptable, even though newer Angular versions might encourage alternative approaches like using lastValueFrom.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The error messages for each field (name, email, and password) match the specified criteria, ensuring that appropriate messages are shown when validations fail.
