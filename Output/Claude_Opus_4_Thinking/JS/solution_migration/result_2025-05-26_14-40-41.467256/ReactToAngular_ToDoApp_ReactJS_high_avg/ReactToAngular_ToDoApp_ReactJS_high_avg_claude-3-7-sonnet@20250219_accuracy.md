# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs
- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules

    The code does not implement lazy loading for feature modules. The application structure shown in the app.module.ts file loads all components eagerly. To implement lazy loading, the application would need to organize components into feature modules and configure the router to load these modules on demand using the loadChildren property in the route configuration. Currently, all components are declared in the main AppModule and loaded at application startup.
