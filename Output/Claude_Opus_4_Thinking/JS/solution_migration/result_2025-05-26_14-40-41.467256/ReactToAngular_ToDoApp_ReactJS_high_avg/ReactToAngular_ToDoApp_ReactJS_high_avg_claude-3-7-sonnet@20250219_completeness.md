# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items
    
    The implementation includes functionality to display all todo items through the `selectAllTodos` selector and the `filteredTodos$` observable in the TodoAppComponent. The todo items are rendered in the template using `*ngFor="let todo of filteredTodos$ | async"`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented
    
    The application correctly implements adding new todo items through the TodoInputComponent which emits a `newTodo` event that is handled by the `onNewTodoAdded` method in the TodoAppComponent, which dispatches the `addTodo` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works
    
    The implementation includes toggling functionality through the `toggleTodo` action and the `onTodoToggled` method which dispatches this action when a todo item's checkbox is clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented
    
    The TodoItemComponent provides editing functionality with methods like `startEdit`, `submitEdit`, and `cancelEdit`. When editing is completed, it emits an update event handled by the TodoAppComponent's `onTodoUpdated` method which dispatches the `updateTodo` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented
    
    The implementation includes delete functionality through the "destroy" button in the TodoItemComponent that emits a delete event, which is handled by `onTodoDeleted` in the TodoAppComponent, dispatching the `deleteTodo` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented
    
    The application implements the "Mark all as complete" functionality through the toggle-all checkbox in the TodoAppComponent template, which triggers the `onToggleAll` method that dispatches the `toggleAllTodos` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works
    
    Filtering is implemented through routing with the TodoFilterGuard and the `setFilter` action. The routes for '/', '/active', and '/completed' correspond to the TodoFilter enum values, and the filtered todos are selected using the `selectFilteredTodos` selector.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items
    
    The TodoFooterComponent receives the `activeCount` input from the TodoAppComponent, which is provided by the `selectActiveTodosCount` selector, and displays it with the appropriate item/items text.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items
    
    The "Clear completed" button in the TodoFooterComponent emits a `clearCompleted` event when clicked, which is handled by the `onClearCompleted` method in TodoAppComponent, dispatching the `clearCompletedTodos` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage
    
    The implementation uses the StorageService to persist todos to local storage. The TodoEffects class has effects for loading todos from storage on initialization and saving todos to storage whenever they are modified.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation
    
    The AppRoutingModule sets up routes with the same structure as the original application ('/', '/active', '/completed') and uses hash-based routing (`useHash: true`) to match the original application's URL format.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states
    
    The application conditionally displays the main section and footer only when there are todos (`*ngIf="(totalCount$ | async) > 0"`) which handles the empty state. However, I can't see explicit code for displaying a message when there are no todos, though this may be handled by CSS.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly
    
    Form submissions are handled correctly throughout the application. The TodoInputComponent prevents default event behavior on Enter key press and emits the todo title when valid. The TodoItemComponent handles editing form submission through keyboard events (Enter to submit, Escape to cancel) and blur events.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships
    
    The application maintains proper component relationships with a clear hierarchy: TodoAppComponent contains TodoInputComponent, TodoItemComponent (for each todo), and TodoFooterComponent. Events flow up from child to parent components, and data flows down from parent to child components, following Angular best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved
    
    The implementation preserves all the business logic from the original application, including adding, toggling, editing, and deleting todos, filtering todos, toggling all todos, clearing completed todos, and persisting todos to local storage.
