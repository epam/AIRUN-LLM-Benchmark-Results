# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The answer explicitly states it targets Angular 14.x. Although the package.json is not shown, it is declared as a migration to Angular 14.x, and the code structure is consistent with Angular 14.x practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The code imports and uses StoreModule.forRoot along with defined reducers, indicating proper use of @ngrx/store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  The answer includes a proper TodoEffects class with createEffect, and the EffectsModule.forRoot configuration confirms its implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  The provided code shows well-structured action definitions, a reducer with state changes via on(), and selectors to derive application state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  All components are decorated with @Component, and use @Input and @Output where needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  The React refs concept is correctly replaced by Angular’s @ViewChild on the corresponding elements (e.g., in TodoInputComponent and TodoItemComponent).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  Components receive data via @Input and communicate back via EventEmitter with @Output, as seen in components like TodoAppComponent and TodoItemComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  The StorageService is implemented to encapsulate localStorage data operations, fulfilling the requirement for services handling business logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  The implementation uses Angular’s dependency injection (e.g., injecting Store, Actions, and services) throughout the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  Components such as TodoItemComponent and TodoFooterComponent apply OnPush change detection strategy to optimize performance.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  The AppRoutingModule is implemented using Angular Router with route definitions and guards.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code adheres to standard Angular coding practices regarding file structure, naming, and formatting. There is a slight reduction in confidence due to the absence of explicit comments on styling; however, the structure is generally consistent.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  The code defines and uses interfaces and enums in multiple files, ensuring strong typing across the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  All React JSX templates have been replaced with Angular HTML templates that utilize Angular syntax and directives.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  React event handler patterns have been correctly replaced with Angular event bindings such as (keydown), (click), and (blur).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  The provided code does not contain any placeholder TODO comments.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  The routing configuration directly loads components via AppRoutingModule without using lazy loading (loadChildren). There is no implementation of lazy-loaded feature modules, hence this step fails.
