# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The implementation uses the NgRx selector “selectFilteredTodos” in TodoAppComponent to show all items (filtered or not) based on the current filter, ensuring that all todo items are displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoInputComponent listens for the ENTER key event and dispatches the addTodo action. The TodoAppComponent receives the event and properly dispatches it to the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  Toggling is supported via the TodoItemComponent’s onToggle method which dispatches toggleTodo. The reducer correctly inverts the “completed” flag, ensuring the functionality works.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  TodoItemComponent has an editing mode with methods (startEdit, cancelEdit, submitEdit) that allow the title to be updated, ensuring that editing functionality is present.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  Deletion is implemented in TodoItemComponent (onDelete method) that dispatches the deleteTodo action, and the reducer filters out the todo to be deleted.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  TodoAppComponent contains a checkbox with an event (onToggleAll) that dispatches toggleAllTodos, which the reducer uses to set all todos’ “completed” properties accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  Angular routes are defined for all three filters and the TodoFilterGuard dispatches the setFilter action based on the URL. The selectors then filter the todos accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooterComponent receives activeCount via inputs from the store selector (selectActiveTodosCount), ensuring that the count is correctly displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The TodoFooterComponent provides a Clear Completed button that, when clicked, dispatches the clearCompletedTodos action. The reducer then filters out all completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  The StorageService is used in the effect (saveTodos$ and loadTodos$) to write to and read from localStorage, thus persistently storing todos across sessions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The AppRoutingModule defines routes for “/”, “/active”, and “/completed” (with a fallback redirect), preserving the URL structure similar to the original application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  The TodoAppComponent uses an *ngIf condition based on totalCount$ to determine if the main and footer sections should be shown, which adheres to handling empty states appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  Form submissions are handled via the keydown event in TodoInputComponent, trimming input and clearing the field after emitting a newTodo event.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  Components communicate using Input and Output properties, and the NgRx-based state management neatly separates business logic from view components, maintaining proper relationships.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  The migration carries over all essential actions, reducer logic, effects, and selectors, maintaining the original TodoMVC business logic within an Angular/Ngrx framework.
