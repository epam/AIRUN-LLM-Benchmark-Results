# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
    
    The package.json file explicitly lists Angular dependencies with version 14.3.0, such as:
    ```
    "@angular/animations": "^14.3.0",
    "@angular/common": "^14.3.0",
    "@angular/compiler": "^14.3.0",
    "@angular/core": "^14.3.0",
    ```
    And the Angular CLI version is specified as "~14.3.0".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS
    
    The code consistently uses ES module syntax with import/export statements throughout all files, such as:
    ```typescript
    import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
    import { Store } from '@ngrx/store';
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management
    
    The code implements NgRx store properly, with dependencies in package.json:
    ```
    "@ngrx/store": "^14.3.3",
    ```
    And proper implementation in the app module:
    ```typescript
    StoreModule.forRoot({ todos: todoReducer }),
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects
    
    The code includes @ngrx/effects with correct implementation in todo.effects.ts and proper registration in the AppModule:
    ```typescript
    EffectsModule.forRoot([TodoEffects]),
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management
    
    The code includes comprehensive NgRx implementation with:
    - Actions (todo.actions.ts): loadTodos, addTodo, updateTodo, etc.
    - Reducer (todo.reducer.ts): handling all action types
    - Selectors (todo.selectors.ts): selectAllTodos, selectFilteredTodos, etc.
    - Effects (todo.effects.ts): loadTodos$, saveTodos$

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator
    
    The TodoStorageService correctly uses the @Injectable decorator:
    ```typescript
    @Injectable({
      providedIn: 'root'
    })
    export class TodoStorageService {
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service
    
    The TodoStorageService correctly implements localStorage for persistence:
    ```typescript
    getTodos(): Todo[] {
      const data = localStorage.getItem(this.STORAGE_KEY);
      return data ? JSON.parse(data) : [];
    }

    saveTodos(todos: Todo[]): void {
      localStorage.setItem(this.STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify(todos));
    }
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators
    
    All components (AppComponent, TodoHeaderComponent, etc.) correctly use the @Component decorator with template and style configurations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators
    
    Both the TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective correctly use the @Directive decorator:
    ```typescript
    @Directive({
      selector: '[todoFocus]'
    })
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)
    
    The templates correctly use Angular structural directives:
    ```html
    <app-todo-item
      *ngFor="let todo of todos; trackBy: trackById"
      [todo]="todo"
      ...
    ```
    ```html
    <app-todo-footer 
      *ngIf="(todoCount$ | async) > 0"
      ...
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))
    
    Event binding syntax is correctly used:
    ```html
    <button class="destroy" (click)="remove.emit(todo.id)"></button>
    ```
    ```html
    <form (submit)="onSubmit()">
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])
    
    Property binding syntax is correctly used:
    ```html
    <li [class.completed]="todo.completed" [class.editing]="editing">
    ```
    ```html
    <input [todoFocus]="editing">
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed
    
    Lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed:
    ```typescript
    export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
      // ...
      ngOnInit(): void {
        this.store.dispatch(TodoActions.loadTodos());
        // ...
      }
    }
    ```
    ```typescript
    export class TodoFocusDirective implements OnChanges {
      // ...
      ngOnChanges(): void {
        // ...
      }
    }
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models
    
    TypeScript interfaces are properly used for data models:
    ```typescript
    export interface Todo {
      id: string;
      title: string;
      completed: boolean;
    }

    export type TodoFilter = 'all' | 'active' | 'completed';
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services
    
    Dependency injection is correctly implemented throughout the application:
    ```typescript
    constructor(private store: Store, private router: Router) {}
    ```
    ```typescript
    constructor(
      private actions$: Actions,
      private store: Store,
      private todoStorage: TodoStorageService
    ) {}
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions
    
    The code follows Angular style guide conventions with:
    - Proper file naming (kebab-case)
    - Component selectors with app- prefix
    - Single responsibility principle
    - Proper module organization
    - Consistent naming conventions

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings
    
    There are no obvious console errors or warnings in the code. However, without running the application, I cannot be 100% certain that there would be no runtime errors or warnings.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)
    
    TypeScript features are properly used throughout the codebase:
    - Interfaces for data models
    - Type annotations for properties, parameters, and return types
    - Generics in store selectors
    - Non-nullable assertions where appropriate (!)
    - Type unions (TodoFilter)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code
    
    There are no TODOs or commented-out code sections in the provided code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design
    
    The application follows single responsibility principle with:
    - AppComponent handling overall application state
    - TodoHeaderComponent focused on adding todos
    - TodoListComponent managing the list display
    - TodoItemComponent handling individual todo items
    - TodoFooterComponent managing filtering and stats
    - Separate directives for focus and escape behaviors
    - Clear separation of concerns between components, services, and store
