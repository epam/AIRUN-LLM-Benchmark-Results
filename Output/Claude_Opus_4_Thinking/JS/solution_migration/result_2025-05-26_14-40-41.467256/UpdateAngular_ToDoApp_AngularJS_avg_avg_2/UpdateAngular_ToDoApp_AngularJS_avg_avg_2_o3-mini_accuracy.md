# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The package.json lists Angular packages at version "^14.3.0", confirming the use of Angular 14.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
  The code uses standard ES module import/export syntax (e.g., "import { ... } from '@angular/core'") rather than any RequireJS syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
  The application integrates @ngrx/store in app.module.ts with a defined reducer (todoReducer) and proper store configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
  The effects module is set up in the application. The TodoEffects class utilizes createEffect() and is registered via EffectsModule.forRoot.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
  The solution includes well-defined TodoActions (addTodo, updateTodo, etc.), a reducer (todoReducer), selectors (for filtering and counts), and effects (TodoEffects) that handle todo-related operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
  The TodoStorageService is decorated with @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }), ensuring DI is set up correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
  The TodoStorageService directly interacts with localStorage using getItem and setItem for storing and retrieving todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
  All components (AppComponent, TodoHeaderComponent, TodoListComponent, TodoItemComponent, TodoFooterComponent) correctly use the @Component decorator.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
  Directives (TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective) are correctly decorated with @Directive and implement appropriate functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
  The templates use Angular syntax such as *ngFor for iterating over todos and *ngIf for conditional rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
  Event binding is properly implemented; for example, (click) is used on buttons and (submit) on forms.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
  Property binding is evident in usages such as [class.completed] in the TodoItemComponent and [checked] in various inputs.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
  Lifecycle hooks like ngOnInit in AppComponent and ngOnChanges in the TodoFocusDirective are correctly implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
  An interface "Todo" and a type "TodoFilter" are defined in the models, ensuring strong typing for data models.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
  Both components and services (such as AppComponent and TodoStorageService) correctly receive dependencies via their constructors.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code is well-structured, separating concerns into modules, components, services, and directives. Although most conventions are met, there is a minor note on the usage pattern in one of the selectors in AppComponent that could be improved for clarity.  
  (Confidence: 90% because while the overall structure meets Angularâ€™s best practices, certain advanced style details (like optimal selector composition) might be refined.)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
  Based on the provided code snippet and configuration, there are no indications of console errors or warnings.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
  The solution makes proper use of TypeScript features such as strict typing, interfaces, and type checks.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
  There are no leftover TODO comments or commented-out code in the provided solution.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows the single responsibility principle in component design  
  The application splits functionality across distinct components (header, list, item, footer) and services, respecting the single responsibility principle.
