  The source includes a dedicated component, TodoListComponent, that renders the list of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos  
  The TodoHeaderComponent is responsible for allowing users to add new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos  
  TodoItemComponent implements editing functionality through methods such as startEdit() and finishEdit().

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos  
  The TodoFooterComponent provides filter options (All, Active, Completed) for viewing todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics  
  TodoFooterComponent displays the count of remaining items and total items using its bindings.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos  
  The onAddTodo method (dispatched from TodoHeaderComponent) and corresponding NgRx action (addTodo) ensure new todos can be added.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos  
  The TodoItemComponent handles updating a todo’s title (and removes it if empty) when editing is finished.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos  
  Both the TodoItemComponent and AppComponent dispatch removeTodo actions to delete todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed  
  The toggle functionality is implemented in TodoItemComponent (via a checkbox) and is handled by the toggleTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)  
  Filters are applied using router-based filtering in AppComponent along with selectors (selectFilteredTodos) for each filter condition.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete  
  The TodoListComponent includes a “toggle-all” checkbox which, when changed, dispatches the toggleAllTodos action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos  
  The TodoFooterComponent has a “Clear completed” button which triggers clearCompletedTodos action to remove completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos  
  The TodoFooterComponent displays the remaining count using the remainingCount$ observable connected through NgRx selectors.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage  
  The TodoStorageService handles persistence by saving todos to localStorage using JSON serialization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization  
  The loadTodos effect in TodoEffects calls TodoStorageService.getTodos() to load persisted data when the application initializes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing  
  The custom TodoEscapeDirective listens for the escape key and emits an event (todoEscape) which is wired in TodoItemComponent to cancel editing.

  The TodoFocusDirective listens for changes and sets focus to the input field when editing is enabled.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original  
  The application references TodoMVC CSS via CDN in index.html and preserves the TodoMVC structural layout.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately  
  In both the header (for adding new todos) and in edit functionality in TodoItemComponent, empty or whitespace-only titles trigger prevention of adding or lead to deletion of the todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter  
  The AppRoutingModule defines routes for '', 'active', and 'completed', and the TodoFooterComponent uses routerLink to update the URL according to the selected filter.
