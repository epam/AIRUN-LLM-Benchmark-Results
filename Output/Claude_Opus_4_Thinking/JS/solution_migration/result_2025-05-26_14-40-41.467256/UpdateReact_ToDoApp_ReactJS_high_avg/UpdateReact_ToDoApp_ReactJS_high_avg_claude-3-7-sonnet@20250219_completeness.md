# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed
  
  The Header component properly implements this functionality in the `handleNewTodoKeyDown` function. It checks for the ENTER_KEY, trims the input text, and dispatches the addTodo action when the key is pressed and the text is not empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter
  
  The MainSection component correctly filters todos based on the current filter value in the Redux store. It uses useMemo to efficiently compute filtered todos when the filter or todos change.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos
  
  The MainSection component includes a toggle-all checkbox that dispatches the toggleAll action to mark all todos as complete or incomplete. This functionality is properly implemented with the handleToggleAll callback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted
  
  The TodoItem component has proper implementation for toggling (handleToggle), editing (handleEdit, handleSubmit), and deleting (handleDestroy) individual todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode
  
  The TodoItem component correctly implements the double-click handler on the label element (`onDoubleClick={handleEdit}`) which sets the editing state by dispatching setEditingId with the todo ID.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo
  
  The TodoItem component's handleKeyDown function checks for the ENTER_KEY and calls handleSubmit which dispatches the updateTodo action with the edited text.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value
  
  The TodoItem component's handleKeyDown function properly handles the ESCAPE_KEY event by resetting the editText to the original todo title and clearing the editing state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The Footer component displays the active todo count with proper pluralization: `<strong>{activeTodoCount}</strong> {activeTodoWord} left`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The Footer component includes links to filter routes ("/", "/active", "/completed") that correspond to the FilterType enum values. The UI correctly applies the "selected" class to the active filter link.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos
  
  The Footer component conditionally renders a "Clear completed" button when there are completed todos, and it dispatches the clearCompleted action when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence
  
  The Redux slice includes loadTodos and saveTodos utility functions to handle localStorage persistence. The saveTodos function is called after every state-changing action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state
  
  The application conditionally renders components based on the state: 
  - MainSection is only shown when there are todos
  - Footer is only shown when there are active or completed todos
  - "Clear completed" button only appears when there are completed todos

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count
  
  The utility function pluralize is implemented and used in the Footer component to correctly show "item" or "items" based on the count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components
  
  The application is well-structured with separate components for App, TodoList, Header, MainSection, TodoItem, and Footer. Each component has a single responsibility and is properly sized.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality
  
  The code is organized into logical directories:
  - components/ for UI components
  - store/ for Redux store and slices
  - types/ for TypeScript interfaces and types
  - hooks/ for custom React hooks
  - utils/ for utility functions
