# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all React imports use React 18.x compatible syntax  
  All React imports use the React 18 API (e.g., using createRoot from 'react-dom/client'), ensuring compatibility with React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all components use functional component syntax with hooks instead of class components  
  Every component is implemented as a functional component using React hooks like useState, useEffect, and useCallback, with no class components present.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Redux Toolkit's createSlice is used for state management  
  The code uses createSlice in the Redux slice (store/todosSlice.ts) to manage state, which is in line with Redux Toolkit best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for all props, state, and Redux store  
  TypeScript interfaces such as ITodo, TodosState, and props interfaces in components are properly defined, ensuring strong type checking.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses immutable state updates in reducers  
  The reducers are implemented within createSlice, which leverages Immer to ensure immutable state updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that nanoid is used for ID generation instead of custom UUID implementation  
  The code imports and uses nanoid from 'nanoid' for generating IDs, meeting the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application uses React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate  
  Components like TodoItem and Footer are wrapped with React.memo to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that useCallback is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders  
  The code employs useCallback in components for event handling (e.g., in Header and TodoItem) to optimize performance.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage handling is implemented in a modern way  
  The localStorage operations are done within try/catch blocks for error handling in loadTodos and saveTodos functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows consistent naming conventions throughout the application  
  Naming conventions (e.g., camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for components) are consistent in the codebase.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper error handling is implemented where necessary  
  Error handling is present for localStorage operations and when accessing the root element in the entry point.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware  
  The Redux store is configured using configureStore from Redux Toolkit, which automatically applies the necessary middleware.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that React.lazy is used for code splitting where appropriate  
  The code does not incorporate React.lazy for code splitting; all components are imported directly without lazy loading. This might be an opportunity to optimize the application further by implementing code splitting where needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the codebase has no TODOs remaining  
  There are no TODO comments present in the code, indicating that all planned changes have been addressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux Provider wraps the application entry point  
  The Redux Provider is correctly implemented in index.tsx, ensuring that the Redux store is available to the entire application.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure strict TypeScript type checking is implemented throughout the application  
  TypeScript is used consistently across the project with strict type checking in components, Redux state, and hooks.
