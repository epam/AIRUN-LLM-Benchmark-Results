# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The Header component listens for the Enter key (using ENTER_KEY) in its onKeyDown handler and dispatches addTodo with the trimmed text.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The TodoList component uses a useMemo hook to filter todos based on the current filter value and renders TodoItem components accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  The MainSection component includes an input checkbox that calls the toggleAll action on change, effectively toggling the completion status for all todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  In the TodoItem component, there is an input for toggling, a button for deletion, and methods to handle editing via double-click and subsequent key events.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  The TodoItem component attaches an onDoubleClick handler to the label which dispatches an action to set the editing mode for the specific todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  In the editing mode of the TodoItem component, the onKeyDown handler checks for the Enter key and then calls the submit handler, which updates the todo via dispatch.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  The onKeyDown handler in TodoItem checks for the Escape key and, when triggered, resets the edit text and exits the editing mode by dispatching the appropriate action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The Footer component clearly renders a todo-count span that shows the activeTodoCount received from the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The Footer component renders three Link elements corresponding to “All”, “Active”, and “Completed” filters with appropriate routing and selected state styling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  The Footer component conditionally renders a “Clear completed” button when there is at least one completed todo, executing the clearCompleted action on click.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  The Redux slice defines loadTodos and saveTodos functions that work with localStorage to persist the todo list.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  The conditional rendering in TodoList and Footer components (e.g., showing MainSection only if todos exist and Footer only if active or completed todos exist) meets this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  The Footer component uses a pluralize utility function, which correctly pluralizes “item” depending on the activeTodoCount.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The code is split into clear, single-purpose components such as Header, MainSection, TodoItem, and Footer, ensuring focused responsibilities.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The project files are well-organized into directories (components, store, hooks, types, utils), reflecting a clear separation of concerns and modular structure.
