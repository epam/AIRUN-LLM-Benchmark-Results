# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration  
  The project uses “npx create-react-app ... --template typescript” and ReactDOM.createRoot, which are indicative of React 18 with TypeScript.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure  
  The code defines interfaces (such as AudioMap) in the types folder and uses them in audioManager.ts to properly map audio elements.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks  
  All components (e.g., App, Header, Controls, Piano, PianoKey, Footer) are implemented as functional components, and hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback) are used throughout.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)  
  The App component uses useState for UI state (displayMode, activeKeys, isFullscreen) and useEffect for managing side effects, meeting the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels  
  Keyboard events are set up in the Piano component using document-level event listeners for keydown and keyup, ensuring proper global handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events  
  The Piano and PianoKey components correctly handle mouse events (mousedown, mouseup, mouseleave, mouseenter) through React synthetic events.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment  
  The AudioManager class handles audio file initialization and playback reliably, using HTMLAudioElement and a managed state for played notes.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility  
  The fullscreen feature is implemented by toggling fullscreen state with event listeners and invoking standard browser API (requestFullscreen and exitFullscreen). Although it employs a common pattern, edge-case compatibility across all browsers might require additional checks; hence, a slightly lower confidence level.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns  
  Conditional classes (e.g., fullscreen open/close, btn-active) are applied via template literals and ternary operations, following standard React practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate  
  Components such as Header, Controls, PianoKey, and Footer are wrapped with React.memo, contributing to performance optimizations.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations  
  The audio playback is managed centrally in AudioManager and invoked via React callbacks with proper lifecycle cleanup (e.g., in useEffect), ensuring consistent behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application  
  TypeScript is integrated throughout the project with defined types and interfaces, ensuring strict typing and enhancing code quality.
