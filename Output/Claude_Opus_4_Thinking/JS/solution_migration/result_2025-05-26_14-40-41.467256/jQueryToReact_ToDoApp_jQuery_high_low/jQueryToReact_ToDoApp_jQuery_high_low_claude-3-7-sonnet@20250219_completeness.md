The answer includes a complete implementation of a TodoMVC application migrated to React 18 with TypeScript and Redux Toolkit. It successfully implements all the required features and functionality of the original TodoMVC application:

- The Header component includes a title ("todos") and an input field for creating new todos
- The TodoList component contains a toggle-all checkbox and renders the list of todos
- Each TodoItem has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button
- Double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode with proper focus management
- The application implements filtering functionality with "All", "Active", and "Completed" options
- The Footer component displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization ("item" vs "items")
- The Footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter using the "selected" class
- The Footer includes a "Clear completed" button that appears only when completed todos exist
- The application allows creating new todos by typing in the input field and pressing Enter
- Individual todos can be toggled between completed and active states
- All todos can be toggled at once using the toggle-all checkbox
- Todos can be edited with proper focus management when double-clicking on them
- Individual todos can be deleted using the destroy button
- All completed todos can be cleared using the "Clear completed" button
- The application properly filters todos based on their completion status using React Router
