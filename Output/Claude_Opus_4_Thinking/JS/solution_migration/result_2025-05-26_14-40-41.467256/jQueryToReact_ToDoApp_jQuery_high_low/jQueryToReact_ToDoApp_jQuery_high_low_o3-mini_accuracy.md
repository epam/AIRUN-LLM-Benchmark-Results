# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18.x  
  The code uses ReactDOM.createRoot from "react-dom/client" which is an API introduced in React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript for type safety  
  The project was created with the TypeScript template, and all files (e.g., .tsx, .ts) include proper TypeScript annotations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for state management  
  The code defines a slice using Redux Toolkitâ€™s createSlice in "todosSlice.ts" along with well-defined reducers.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm nanoid is used for generating unique IDs  
  nanoid is imported and used when adding new todos, ensuring unique identifiers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code uses functional components with hooks instead of class components  
  All components, such as Header, TodoItem, TodoList, etc., are implemented as functional components using React hooks.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains the same routing functionality with proper route handling  
  React Router v6 is used with defined routes (e.g., "/:filter") and redirection logic in index.tsx, maintaining filtering functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Redux store is properly configured with appropriate slices  
  The store is configured in "store.ts" with a reducer for todos, correctly assembling the slice from the todos feature.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the Redux provider is set up in the application entry point  
  The Provider is correctly used in index.tsx to wrap the application, ensuring Redux state is accessible.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for all data structures  
  Type safety is enforced through well-defined interfaces (e.g., Todo, FilterType) and types are used throughout the Redux slice and components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows React best practices for component composition  
  Components are modular, responsibilities are well-separated, and hooks are used for state and side effects, following React best practices.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the application handles keyboard events properly (Enter key for creating/updating todos, Escape key for canceling edits)  
  The Header and TodoItem components handle keyboard events such as Enter and Escape. Although the code uses the deprecated keyCode property instead of the modern "key" property, the functionality works as intended. This minor detail prevents a full 100% rating.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application maintains local storage persistence if implemented  
  The Redux slice integrates local storage persistence through loadTodos and saveTodos functions, ensuring todos are reloaded on startup.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  The code appears clean with no obvious sources for console errors or warnings. However, usage of deprecated properties (e.g., keyCode) could potentially trigger warnings in strict environments, so confidence is slightly less than 100%.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the application implements proper error handling  
  The loadTodos function includes a try-catch block to handle localStorage errors. While basic error handling is present, there is room for more comprehensive error management across the application.

- **Pass** (85%): Confirm the code is optimized with no unnecessary re-renders  
  The components are functional and largely optimized; however, the use of inline functions and the absence of memoization (e.g., via React.memo or useMemo) in some areas might lead to minor unnecessary re-renders in more complex scenarios. Overall, the code is acceptable for its intended use.
