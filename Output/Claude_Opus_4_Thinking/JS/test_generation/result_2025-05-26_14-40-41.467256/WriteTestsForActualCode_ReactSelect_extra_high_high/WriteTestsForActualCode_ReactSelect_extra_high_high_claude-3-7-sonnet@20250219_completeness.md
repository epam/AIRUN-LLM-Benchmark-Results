# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist
  
  The test suite includes comprehensive tests for basic component rendering with default props in several test files, specifically in `__tests__/Select.test.tsx` under the "Basic Rendering" describe block. Tests verify that the component renders with default props, placeholder text, and expected DOM structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present
  
  Extensive keyboard navigation tests are present in `__tests__/Select.keyboard.test.tsx`. The test suite covers arrow keys for menu navigation, Enter for selection, Escape for menu closing, Tab for focus management, and additional keyboard interactions like Home/End and Page Up/Down.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)
  
  Mouse interactions are thoroughly tested in `__tests__/Select.mouse.test.tsx`. The tests cover clicking on the control, options, indicators, and multi-value remove buttons. Hover interactions that highlight options and touch events are also well tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior
  
  Both controlled and uncontrolled component behaviors are tested in `__tests__/Select.state.test.tsx`. Tests verify that controlled components respect prop changes without internal state changes, while uncontrolled components properly manage their own state when props are undefined.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values
  
  State changes during selection, removal, and clearing of values are thoroughly tested across multiple test files, with dedicated tests in `__tests__/Select.state.test.tsx` and interaction tests in the keyboard and mouse test files that verify the correct state changes occur.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented
  
  Menu opening/closing behavior is tested extensively in multiple test files. Tests verify menu opening on click, keyboard interactions, and proper closing via Escape key, outside clicks, and selection events when configured.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality
  
  Option filtering and searching functionality is tested in `__tests__/Select.menu.test.tsx` under the "Option Filtering" describe block. Tests verify default filtering behavior, custom filtering functions, and displaying appropriate messages when no options match.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist
  
  Multi-select behavior is tested throughout the suite, with specific tests in multiple files. Tests cover selection/deselection of multiple values, keyboard navigation between values, and removal of values with Delete/Backspace keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility
  
  ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility are thoroughly tested in `__tests__/Select.accessibility.test.tsx`. Tests verify proper role attributes, aria-expanded states, live regions for announcements, and other accessibility features.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested
  
  Edge cases like empty options are tested throughout the suite. In `__tests__/Select.menu.test.tsx`, there are specific tests for empty groups, filtering that returns no matches, and handling null/undefined values.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states
  
  Loading states are tested in multiple files, particularly in `__tests__/Select.test.tsx` under the "Loading State" describe block. Tests verify loading indicators, custom loading messages, and proper behavior while loading.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states
  
  Disabled options and component states are well-tested across multiple files. Tests verify rendering of disabled options with correct styling, preventing selection of disabled options, and proper component behavior when the entire component is disabled.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance
  
  Tests for large option sets are included in `__tests__/Select.menu.test.tsx` and `__tests__/Select.keyboard.test.tsx`. Tests use arrays of many options to verify scrolling behavior, pagination with Page Up/Down keys, and proper menu rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested
  
  Focus management is extensively tested throughout the suite, particularly in `__tests__/Select.accessibility.test.tsx` and state management tests. Tests verify proper focus trapping, restoration after menu close, and focus handling during keyboard navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering
  
  Placeholder and value rendering tests are present in `__tests__/Select.test.tsx` under the "Value Rendering" describe block. Tests verify correct display of placeholder text when no value is selected and proper rendering of single and multiple values.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations
  
  Custom formatOptionLabel implementations are tested in `__tests__/Select.menu.test.tsx` under the "Option Formatting" describe block. Tests verify that custom formatting functions are called with the correct context and that formatted content is rendered properly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)
  
  Callback function testing is thorough throughout the test suite. Tests verify that onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, and onMenuClose are called with the correct parameters under appropriate circumstances.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)
  
  Indicator components are well-tested in multiple files. Tests verify the rendering and behavior of dropdown indicators, clear indicators, and loading indicators, including their appearance, interactions, and accessibility.
