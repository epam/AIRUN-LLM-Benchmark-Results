# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verified tests for basic component rendering with default props exist.  
  The test suite (in __tests__/Select.test.tsx) contains a "Basic Rendering" section that checks for rendering with default properties.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirmed tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present.  
  The __tests__/Select.keyboard.test.tsx file includes tests for key events such as ArrowDown, Escape, Enter, Tab, Home/End, and Page Up/Down.

- **Pass** (100%): Validated presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking and hovering).  
  The __tests__/Select.mouse.test.tsx file contains tests for control clicks, option selection on click, hovering for focus, and handling of right-click events.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirmed test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior.  
  The __tests__/Select.state.test.tsx file clearly tests controlled scenarios (value updates via props) and uncontrolled behavior, ensuring accurate state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verified tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values exist.  
  The extensive test sections for multi-select, clear indicator interactions, and option selection ensure state transitions are well verified.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensured tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented.  
  Multiple tests across keyboard, mouse, and state management files simulate menu open and close events (via clicks, escape key, etc.).

- **Pass** (100%): Validated test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality.  
  The test suite contains dedicated tests for filtering options based on input, custom filter functions, and displaying a no-options message.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirmed tests for multi-select behavior exist.  
  Several tests verify multi-select scenarios including selecting multiple options, removing specific values, and focus behavior in multi-select mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verified tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility.  
  The __tests__/Select.accessibility.test.tsx file checks ARIA attributes, live regions, and roles to ensure accessibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensured edge cases like empty options (or empty groups) are tested.  
  Tests for group rendering include scenarios for empty groups and verify that empty groups do not render.

- **Pass** (100%): Validated tests for loading and error states.  
  The test suite covers rendering of loading indicators and custom loading messages, confirming error and loading state handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verified tests for disabled options and disabled states.  
  There are multiple tests ensuring disabled states are rendered correctly and that disabled options are not selectable or interactive.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirmed tests for large option sets to verify performance aspects.  
  The tests include scenarios with many options (using Page Up/Down and scroll events) to simulate performance with large datasets.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensured focus management during interactions is properly tested.  
  Several tests verify that focus moves appropriately during interactions (e.g., between input and control, option focus, and focus clearing).

- **Pass** (100%): Verified tests for placeholder and value rendering.  
  The test suite checks that custom placeholders are rendered as well as how selected values are displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensured test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations.  
  The "Option Formatting" section contains tests for custom formatOptionLabel and formatGroupLabel functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verified callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose).  
  The tests consistently check that the appropriate callbacks are invoked under the right conditions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validated tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading) are implemented.  
  Specific tests ensure that the dropdown indicator toggles the menu correctly, the clear indicator functions as expected, and the loading indicator is displayed in loading state.
