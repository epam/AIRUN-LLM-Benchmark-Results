# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)
  
  The code clearly uses Jasmine as the testing framework with Karma as the test runner. This is evident from the karma.conf.js configuration which sets `frameworks: ['jasmine']` and the test files that use Jasmine's syntax with `describe`, `it`, `beforeEach`, and `expect` functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints
  
  The tests consistently mock the $resource service and handle REST API endpoints appropriately. This is demonstrated in various test files, particularly in the REST Factory tests where $resource is mocked and in the controller tests where the REST factory is mocked with jasmine spy objects for all relevant endpoints.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation
  
  Each test suite properly utilizes `beforeEach` hooks to set up the testing environment, create modules, inject dependencies, and reset state between tests. This ensures proper test isolation and prevents test state leakage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls
  
  All HTTP requests are properly mocked using Jasmine spy objects and Angular's $httpBackend service. The tests avoid making real API calls by mocking REST.content, REST.contentRevisions, etc., and providing fake responses through .and.callFake() methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection
  
  The tests correctly use Angular's dependency injection pattern, using the `inject` function to inject services like _$controller_, _$rootScope_, _REST_, etc. Dependencies are also properly mocked in the module configuration phase using `$provide`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations
  
  The tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations through the use of $q for promise creation, proper mocking of promise-returning methods, and using $scope.$digest() to process the digest cycle when testing promise resolutions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies
  
  The tests make excellent use of Jasmine spies for external dependencies. For example, spyOn($rootScope, '$broadcast'), spyOn($location, 'path'), and spyOn(localStorage, 'getItem') are used to mock behavior and verify interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization
  
  All tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization. The tests are well-structured with nested describe blocks that group related functionality, making the test suite easy to read and maintain.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls
  
  The tests thoroughly cover both success and error scenarios for API calls. For example, in the Page Controller tests, there are specific tests for handling save errors, and in the Tag Autocomplete tests, error handling for the query operation is explicitly tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate
  
  The tests appropriately simulate user interactions by calling controller methods that would be triggered by user actions, such as $scope.savePage(), $scope.titleChange(), $scope.selectSuggestion(), etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage
  
  The tests use beforeEach hooks to reset state between tests, and the use of isolated scopes ($rootScope.$new()) ensures that state does not leak between tests. There is no explicit afterEach hook, but it's not necessary given the proper setup in beforeEach.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested
  
  The tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested. Examples include "should auto-generate URL from title for new pages", "should save tags for new content", and "should handle scheduled publishing correctly".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible
  
  The tests appropriately focus on validating function outputs and side effects rather than implementation details. They verify that the expected state changes occur after method calls, such as checking $scope properties after calling controller methods, and verify that the correct API calls are made with the expected parameters.
