# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)  
  The tests utilize Jasmine for writing test cases along with Karma as the test runner, which qualifies as a modern testing framework for AngularJS.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints  
  The tests for the REST Factory and controllers employ AngularJS’s dependency injection to substitute and spy on the $resource methods. Custom endpoints and method calls (e.g., save, update, delete) are mocked or spied upon to simulate API interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation  
  The test suite uses multiple beforeEach calls to set up modules, dependencies, and mocks. This ensures that each test has an isolated execution environment.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls  
  By employing angular-mocks and using $httpBackend (even if only in some tests) along with the use of spies on REST methods, the tests avoid making any actual HTTP requests.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection  
  The tests consistently use inject() and module() methods to load AngularJS modules and inject dependencies such as $controller, $rootScope, REST, Page, Users, etc.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations  
  The tests simulate promise resolution (e.g., $translate service returns a promise) and mock asynchronous calls using deferreds and resolved promises. However, some asynchronous flows could be further refined with explicit $scope.$apply or done() callbacks in asynchronous specs.  
  Explanation: While the tests handle promises in several places, explicit async verification (such as using done() or $apply() where necessary) is not uniformly visible across all asynchronous operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies  
  Spies (using spyOn) are set for various external dependencies like $resource, localStorage, and broadcast methods. This clearly verifies that external behavior is mocked effectively.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization  
  The entire test suite is organized using nested describe blocks and individual it blocks, which provides a clear, hierarchical, and readable structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls  
  The tests validate API interactions by testing both success (e.g., save, update) and error cases (e.g., handling failed updates or autocomplete errors), ensuring robust coverage of various outcomes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate  
  The tests simulate user actions indirectly by calling functions such as titleChange, descriptionChange, and savePage, which reflects common user interactions with the UI.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage  
  The tests employ AngularJS’s built-in module and dependency injection setup to reinitialize states before each test. Although explicit afterEach clean-up hooks are not used, the standard AngularJS testing practices likely ensure minimal state leakage.  
  Explanation: Explicit tear-down steps are not shown, but the AngularJS testing framework typically handles module destruction between tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested  
  The test case names (inside it blocks) are descriptive and clearly indicate the feature or behavior being verified, such as “should update existing page correctly” or “should handle tag query errors.”

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible  
  Most test cases validate observable outputs (e.g., changes in page object properties, localStorage calls, REST method invocations) rather than the internal logic.  
  Explanation: While the tests focus on behavior and outputs, some expectations (for instance, verifying exact calls to localStorage.setItem with hardcoded keys) lean a bit toward checking implementation details. This could be seen as slightly less flexible to refactoring.
