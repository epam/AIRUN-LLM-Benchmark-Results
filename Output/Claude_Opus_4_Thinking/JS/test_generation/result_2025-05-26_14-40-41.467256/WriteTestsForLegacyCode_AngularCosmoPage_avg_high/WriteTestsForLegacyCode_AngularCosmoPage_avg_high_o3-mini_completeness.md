# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources  
  All endpoints defined in the REST factory are tested, including verifying that each endpoint is defined and that the custom methods (such as update) behave correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly  
  The Page factory tests cover expected properties, default values, and singleton behavior, confirming that properties are correctly initialized.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly  
  The Users factory tests check for the presence of expected properties and proper default values, as well as validate the singleton behavior of the factory.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods  
  The pageCtrl controller tests encompass various aspects including initialization, local storage management, deletion, updates, tag autocomplete, and event handling, ensuring robust coverage of public methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller  
  The tests ensure that the controller correctly initializes page data using the Page factory values and handles conditions (such as new pages and unsaved versions) appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation  
  The titleChange tests cover scenarios such as generating a URL from a title for new pages, preserving existing URLs for updates, and correctly removing special characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction  
  The provided tests for saveLocal confirm that localStorage is accessed and updated appropriately, ensuring the restoration and deletion of local versions works as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality  
  The autocompleteTags tests verify that tag suggestions are queried when a tag is partially entered, that suggestions are cleared when no valid input exists, and that errors are handled gracefully.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)  
  The tests for savePage comprehensively address multiple scenarios including saving new pages, updating existing pages, handling duplication errors, scheduled publishing, and saving extras.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types  
  Specific tests verify that errors are correctly raised when the URL is empty or when a page type is not selected, ensuring that these edge cases are properly handled.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly  
  The deletion tests confirm that the REST methods for deleting a page and its related content are invoked correctly and that post-deletion actions (such as redirection and notifications) occur as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions  
  Tests in the "Local Version Management" section check the proper restoration and deletion of local versions using localStorage, ensuring the correct management of unsaved changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components  
  The test coverage summary clearly states 100% coverage for the REST, Page, and Users factories and 90%+ for the pageCtrl controller, exceeding the 80% threshold.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling  
  The tests verify that events like "notify" and "contentGet" are broadcasted correctly in response to actions within the controller, ensuring robust event handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality  
  The tests address scheduling scenarios by verifying that the scheduleDate is set for new pages, and that the publish status is correctly updated depending on whether the scheduled date is in the future or in the past.
