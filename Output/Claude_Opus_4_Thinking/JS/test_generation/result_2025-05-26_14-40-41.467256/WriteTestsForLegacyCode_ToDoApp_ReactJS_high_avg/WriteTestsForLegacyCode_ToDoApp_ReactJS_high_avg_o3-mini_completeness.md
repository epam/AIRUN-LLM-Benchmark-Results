- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos  
  The "toggle all" tests in app.test.tsx confirm that toggling the checkbox correctly calls the toggleAll method and reflects a checked state when appropriate.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos  
  The "todo filtering" section simulates route changes to filter todos (all, active, completed) and verifies the proper invocation of routing functionality and rendering differences.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  There is a clear test under "clear completed" that simulates clicking the clear completed button and checks that the clearCompleted method is called.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering  
  The todoItem.test.tsx file includes multiple tests ensuring that a TodoItem renders correctly with appropriate classes and text based on its state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos  
  Tests for toggling (via checkbox), destroying (via delete button), and editing (via double-click on the label) are implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events  
  The tests cover key events such as Enter and Escape keys during editing, as well as blur events to trigger saving or cancelation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts  
  The footer.test.tsx file tests that the correct singular or plural label is displayed based on the count of remaining items.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation  
  There are tests confirming that the filter links are rendered with the correct href attributes and that the correct filter is highlighted based on the nowShowing property.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The tests verify that the "Clear completed" button is conditionally rendered and that its click event triggers the expected callback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos  
  The todoModel.test.ts file has individual tests for addTodo, toggle, save, and destroy operations on todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions  
  Tests are provided that check the behavior of subscribe (adding onChange callbacks) and inform (calling callbacks and storing data).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The clearCompleted function is directly exercised and its effect on the todo list is verified.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation  
  The uuid function is tested for both valid format and uniqueness.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality  
  The pluralize utility function is tested for both singular (count = 1) and plural cases (all other counts).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations  
  The store function is tested to confirm it correctly stores and retrieves data from localStorage, handling both valid and invalid JSON.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function  
  The extend function is tested with multiple objects to ensure correct merging and property overriding behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx  
  The test files are named appropriately (e.g., constants.test.ts, todoModel.test.ts, footer.test.tsx, todoItem.test.tsx, app.test.tsx) according to the naming conventions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data  
  Sample todo objects are defined and used across various test files to simulate realistic todo data.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented  
  The app.test.tsx file mocks the Router and verifies that routes are correctly initialized and invoked.
