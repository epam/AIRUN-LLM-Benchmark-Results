### Accessibility
- **Pass**: Verify that all form inputs have associated labels for better accessibility.
- **Pass**: Ensure that semantic HTML elements like `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<header>` are used to improve accessibility.
- **Pass**: Check that ARIA attributes are used appropriately to enhance accessibility for screen readers.

### Code Quality
- **Pass**: Confirm that functional components with hooks are used instead of class components where possible.
- **Pass**: Verify that the code follows React and Redux best practices, such as proper state management and component lifecycle methods.
- **Pass**: Ensure that prop types are defined and documented using `PropTypes` or TypeScript interfaces.
- **Pass**: Confirm adherence to React and JavaScript best practices, such as avoiding direct state mutations.
- **Pass**: Check if the code is refactored to separate concerns and use dependency injection for better testability.

### Testing
- **Fail**: Verify that there are unit tests for the components using testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.
- **Fail**: Ensure that the tests cover different scenarios and edge cases, including form validation and submission.

### Documentation
- **Pass**: Verify that comments are added to explain the purpose of complex code blocks.
- **Pass**: Check that the PropTypes are documented for better understanding of the expected props.
- **Pass**: Ensure that the code has sufficient documentation, including function and component descriptions.
- **Pass**: Confirm that the documentation is clear, concise, and follows a consistent format.
