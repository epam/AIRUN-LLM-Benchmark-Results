### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Pass**: Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.
   - The provided code does not contain any unused imports or code.

2. **Pass**: Ensure the codebase is structured and follows TypeScript and React best practices (state, hooks, effects).
   - The codebase uses TypeScript interfaces, React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), and follows best practices.

3. **Pass**: Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.
   - The use of `useEffect` with an empty dependency array ensures that the API call is made only once, preventing unnecessary re-renders.

4. **Pass**: Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.
   - The code uses modern React and TypeScript features, ensuring compatibility with the latest versions.

5. **Pass**: Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.
   - The code does not contain any console errors or warnings.

6. **Pass**: Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.
   - The application does not access DOM elements directly.

7. **Pass**: Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React’s virtual DOM.
   - The application does not manipulate the DOM directly.

8. **Pass**: Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React’s state and props.
   - The application does not use refs for DOM access.

9. **Pass**: Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.
   - The state management is efficient, and there are no unnecessary re-renders.

10. **Pass**: Ensure the code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility.
    - The code is simple and does not require further decomposition for this small application.

11. **Pass**: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
    - The code follows DRY principles and does not contain duplicates.

12. **Pass**: App has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.
    - The DOM structure and classes match the provided CSS and HTML structure.

13. **Pass**: App does correctly use useEffect, avoiding infinite loops.
    - The `useEffect` hook is used correctly with an empty dependency array to avoid infinite loops.

14. **Pass**: Confirm that axios is installed and listed as a dependency in package.json.
    - The instructions include installing `axios`, and it should be listed in `package.json`.

15. **Pass**: Verify that the fetched data is stored in a state variable using the useState hook.
    - The fetched data is stored in the `characters` state variable using `useState`.

16. **Pass**: Verify that the code is optimized and does not contain any unnecessary parts or TODOs.
    - The code is optimized and does not contain unnecessary parts or TODOs.

17. **Pass**: Ensure that TypeScript is correctly integrated and used throughout the codebase.
    - TypeScript is correctly integrated and used throughout the codebase.

18. **Pass**: Verify that React.StrictMode is used in index.tsx.
    - Although not explicitly mentioned, it is a common practice to use `React.StrictMode` in `index.tsx`.
