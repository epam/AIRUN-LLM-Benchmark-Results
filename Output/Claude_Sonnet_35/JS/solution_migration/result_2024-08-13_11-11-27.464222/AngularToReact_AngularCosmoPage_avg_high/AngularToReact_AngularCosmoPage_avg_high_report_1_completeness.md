# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Confirm that the state slices for page and user are correctly defined and managed.
- **Pass**: The state slices for `page` and `user` are correctly defined using `createSlice` from Redux Toolkit. The initial states are set, and reducers for setting and resetting the state are provided.

### Step 2: Verify that API service functions are correctly defined and used.
- **Pass**: The API service functions are correctly defined using `axios`. Each function corresponds to a specific endpoint and HTTP method, ensuring proper interaction with the backend.

### Step 3: Ensure that the application correctly handles all the functionalities from the original Angular code.
- **Pass**: The main functionalities from the original Angular code, such as state management, API interactions, and component rendering, are correctly handled in the React code. The `PageEditor` component encapsulates the main functionality.

### Step 4: Verify that all functionalities like save, delete, update, and tag management are working correctly.
- **Pass**: The `PageEditor` component includes methods for handling save, delete, and update operations. Tag management is handled through the API service functions.

### Step 5: Ensure that the application performs all CRUD operations correctly.
- **Pass**: The API service functions cover all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for various entities like blocks, comments, content, files, menus, modules, themes, settings, and users.

### Step 6: Verify that the application handles local storage and state persistence correctly.
- **Pass**: The `PageEditor` component includes logic to check for unsaved versions in local storage and update the state accordingly. This ensures state persistence across sessions.
