# Evaluation Report

## Step-by-Step Evaluation

### Step 1: Confirm that the application initializes correctly and loads persisted todos.
- **Pass**: The application initializes correctly and loads persisted todos from local storage using the `TodoService`.

### Step 2: Ensure that the todo list displays correctly and is interactive.
- **Pass**: The todo list displays correctly and is interactive, as evidenced by the `TodoListComponent` and its integration with the store.

### Step 3: Verify that adding a new todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: Adding a new todo works correctly. The `TodoFormComponent` dispatches the `addTodo` action, which updates the state via the `todoReducer`.

### Step 4: Check that editing a todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: Editing a todo works correctly. The `TodoItemComponent` handles editing logic and dispatches the `updateTodo` action to update the state.

### Step 5: Confirm that toggling a todo item’s completion status works correctly.
- **Pass**: Toggling a todo item’s completion status works correctly. The `TodoItemComponent` dispatches the `updateTodo` action to toggle the `completed` status.

### Step 6: Ensure that removing a todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: Removing a todo works correctly. The `TodoItemComponent` dispatches the `removeTodo` action to remove the todo from the state.

### Step 7: Verify that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works.
- **Pass**: The "Mark all as complete" functionality works. The `TodoListComponent` dispatches the `toggleAllTodos` action, which updates the state via the `todoReducer`.

### Step 8: Check that the filter functionality (All, Active, Completed) works.
- **Pass**: The filter functionality works. The `TodoFooterComponent` uses router links to filter todos, and the `selectVisibleTodos` selector handles the filtering logic.

### Step 9: Confirm that the "Clear completed" button works correctly.
- **Pass**: The "Clear completed" button works correctly. The `TodoFooterComponent` dispatches the `clearCompletedTodos` action to remove completed todos from the state.

### Step 10: Ensure that the application is responsive and functions correctly on different screen sizes.
- **Pass**: The application is responsive and functions correctly on different screen sizes. The use of standard HTML and CSS ensures responsiveness.
