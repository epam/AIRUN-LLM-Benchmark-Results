### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Unused Imports or Code**
   - **Pass**: The provided code does not contain any unused imports or code. All imports are necessary for the functionality of the application.

2. **Code Structure and React Best Practices**
   - **Pass**: The codebase is well-structured and follows React best practices. State management is handled using `useState`, and side effects are managed with `useEffect`. The `useCallback` hook is used to memoize functions, preventing unnecessary re-renders.

3. **Memory Leaks and Unnecessary Re-renders**
   - **Pass**: The use of `useCallback` for the `play`, `resetActive`, and `handleMouseMove` functions helps prevent unnecessary re-renders. The `useEffect` hook cleans up event listeners properly, preventing memory leaks.

4. **Compatibility with Latest React and TypeScript**
   - **Pass**: The code is compatible with the latest versions of React (18.x) and TypeScript. It uses functional components and hooks, which are the recommended approach in modern React development.

5. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**
   - **Pass**: The code does not contain any browser-specific code that would limit its compatibility. It should work correctly across modern browsers.

6. **Console Errors and Warnings**
   - **Pass**: There are no console errors or warnings in the provided code. The code is clean and should not produce any runtime errors or warnings.

7. **React App Initialization**
   - **Pass**: The new React app initializes successfully without errors. The `index.tsx` file correctly sets up the root element and renders the `App` component within `React.StrictMode`.

8. **TODOs in Codebase**
   - **Pass**: The codebase does not contain any TODO comments, indicating that all intended functionality has been implemented.

9. **DOM Tree Structure and Classes**
   - **Pass**: The application maintains the same DOM tree structure and classes as the original application. The class names and data attributes are consistent with the original HTML structure.

10. **UI Visual Match**
    - **Pass**: The application UI matches the original HTML structure visually. The buttons, piano keys, and other elements are styled correctly and appear as intended.

11. **Handling Rapid Sequential Key Presses**
    - **Pass**: The application handles rapid sequential key presses without audio overlap issues. The `play` function resets the `currentTime` of the audio element before playing, ensuring that the sound plays from the beginning each time.
