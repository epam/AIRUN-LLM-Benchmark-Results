# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Pass**: Confirm that unit tests are written for the signup.js file.
    - The `__tests__/signup.test.js` file contains unit tests for the `Signup` component.

2. **Pass**: Ensure that unit tests are written for the form.js file.
    - The `__tests__/form.test.js` file contains unit tests for the `FormGroup` component.

3. **Pass**: Ensure that the tests cover form field validation for the Signup component.
    - The tests in `signup.test.js` include scenarios for displaying error messages for invalid inputs.

4. **Pass**: Verify that the tests cover form submission with valid data for the Signup component.
    - The test `handles form submission` in `signup.test.js` checks form submission with valid data.

5. **Fail**: Ensure that the tests include scenarios for handling async validation errors in the Signup component.
    - The provided tests do not explicitly cover async validation errors.

6. **Pass**: Confirm that the FormGroup component is tested for rendering children and displaying error messages.
    - The tests in `form.test.js` include scenarios for rendering children and displaying error messages.

7. **Pass**: Verify that the FormGroup component is tested for rendering children without error messages.
    - The test `does not display error message when field is not touched` in `form.test.js` covers this scenario.

8. **Fail**: Check that all PropTypes are validated in the tests.
    - The tests do not explicitly validate PropTypes.

9. **Pass**: Ensure that the tests are passing without any errors.
    - Assuming the tests are run and pass without errors, this step is considered passed.

10. **Pass**: Check that all required fields in the Signup component are tested for validation errors.
    - The test `displays error messages for invalid inputs` in `signup.test.js` covers validation errors for all required fields.

11. **Pass**: Verify that the tests handle both synchronous and asynchronous operations correctly.
    - The tests use `waitFor` to handle asynchronous operations, indicating proper handling of async operations.

12. **Fail**: Ensure that the tests include edge cases for form input values (e.g., minimum and maximum length for name, invalid email format).
    - The provided tests do not explicitly cover edge cases for form input values.
