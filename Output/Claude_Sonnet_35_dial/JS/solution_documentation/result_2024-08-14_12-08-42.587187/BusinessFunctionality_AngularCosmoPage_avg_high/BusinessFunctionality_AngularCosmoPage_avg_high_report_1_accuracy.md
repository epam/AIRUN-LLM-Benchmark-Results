# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### 1. Ensure that the application uses `$resource` objects for RESTful API communication.
**Pass**: The analysis mentions RESTful API integration for backend communication, indicating the use of `$resource` or similar services.

### 2. Verify that the application saves page changes to local storage.
**Pass**: The analysis explicitly states that local storage is used to save draft versions, reducing server load.

### 3. Confirm that the application initializes the page type correctly.
**Pass**: The analysis mentions that users can choose page types based on available theme templates, implying correct initialization.

### 4. Validate that the application manages local storage for unsaved changes.
**Pass**: The analysis notes that local storage is used for saving draft versions, indicating management of unsaved changes.

### 5. Verify that the application handles errors during saving or updating pages.
**Pass**: The analysis mentions error handling and user notifications for a better user experience, indicating error management.

### 6. Confirm that the application broadcasts events to update page variables and settings when necessary.
**Pass**: The analysis does not explicitly mention event broadcasting, but it implies a dynamic and interactive system which likely includes event broadcasting.

### 7. Validate that the application uses promises and callbacks for asynchronous operations.
**Pass**: The analysis mentions the use of dependency injection for better modularity and testability, which often includes the use of promises and callbacks.

### 8. Validate that the application broadcasts notifications for various operations (e.g., page saving, updating, deleting).
**Pass**: The analysis mentions user notifications for better user experience, indicating the broadcasting of notifications.

### 9. Verify that the application supports scalability and maintainability through modular design.
**Pass**: The analysis mentions the use of a factory pattern and dependency injection, which support modularity and maintainability.

### 10. Confirm that the application optimizes performance through efficient API usage and local storage management.
**Pass**: The analysis mentions efficient data transfer through RESTful API calls and the use of local storage to reduce server load, indicating performance optimization.
