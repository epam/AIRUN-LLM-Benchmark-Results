### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Pass**: Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.
   - All imports are used appropriately in the code.

2. **Pass**: Ensure the codebase is structured and follows React best practices (state, hooks, effects).
   - The codebase is well-structured, and React hooks and effects are used correctly.

3. **Pass**: Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.
   - The use of hooks and state management appears to be optimized to prevent memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.

4. **Pass**: Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.
   - The code is compatible with React 18.x and TypeScript.

5. **Pass**: Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.
   - There are no apparent console errors or warnings in the provided code.

6. **Pass**: Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.
   - The app uses React state to manage form values instead of directly accessing DOM elements.

7. **Pass**: Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React’s virtual DOM.
   - The app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React’s virtual DOM.

8. **Pass**: Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React’s state and props.
   - The app does not overuse refs and relies on state and props for managing data.

9. **Pass**: Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.
   - The state and prop changes are managed efficiently to avoid excessive re-renders.

10. **Pass**: Ensure the code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility.
    - The code is decomposed into multiple components, each with a single responsibility.

11. **Pass**: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
    - The code follows DRY principles and does not contain unnecessary duplicates.

12. **Pass**: App does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.
    - This step is a duplicate of step 6 and has already been evaluated as passed.

13. **Pass**: App has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.
    - The DOM tree structure and classes are consistent with the original application.

14. **Pass**: Ensure that the store is properly configured and provided to the app.
    - The Redux store is properly configured and provided to the app.

15. **Pass**: Verify that the code is migrated to React 18.x.
    - The code is migrated to React 18.x.

16. **Pass**: Check that TypeScript is used in the translated code.
    - TypeScript is used throughout the code.

17. **Pass**: Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for managing local data.
    - Redux Toolkit with `createSlice` is used for managing local data.

18. **Pass**: Ensure that the code is split into separate components.
    - The code is split into separate components.

19. **Pass**: Validate that the code does not contain any TODOs.
    - The code does not contain any TODOs.

20. **Pass**: Check that the code is optimized.
    - The code appears to be optimized.
