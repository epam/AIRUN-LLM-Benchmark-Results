   - **Pass**: All imports are used in the code.

2. **Ensure the codebase is structured and follows Angular style guidelines and best practices.**
   - **Pass**: The codebase is well-structured, with components, models, and store files organized appropriately.

3. **Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of Angular and TypeScript.**
   - **Pass**: The code uses Angular 14.x features and syntax, indicating compatibility with the latest version.

4. **Verify the application works correctly across modern browsers.**
   - **Not Evaluated**: This step requires running the application in different browsers, which is not possible in this static evaluation.

5. **Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.**
   - **Not Evaluated**: This step requires running the application and checking the console, which is not possible in this static evaluation.

6. **Ensure the code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility.**
   - **Pass**: The code is decomposed into multiple components, each handling a specific part of the application.

7. **Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.**
   - **Pass**: The code does not contain any noticeable duplicates and follows DRY principles.

8. **Check that @ngrx/store is used for state management.**
   - **Pass**: @ngrx/store is used for state management.

9. **Check that @ngrx/effects is used for handling side effects.**
   - **Pass**: @ngrx/effects is used for handling side effects.

10. **Confirm that the code is split into separate components.**
    - **Pass**: The code is split into separate components.

11. **Ensure that localStorage is used for persisting todos via a service.**
    - **Fail**: localStorage is used directly in the effect instead of via a service.

12. **Check that state management actions and reducers are correctly implemented.**
    - **Pass**: State management actions and reducers are correctly implemented.

13. **Verify that effects are correctly implemented to handle side effects.**

16. **Confirm that the application structure adheres to Angular style guidelines.**
    - **Pass**: The application structure adheres to Angular style guidelines.

17. **Verify App does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.**
    - **Pass**: The app uses Angular's two-way data binding to retrieve the values of text fields.

18. **Verify App does not make API calls.**
    - **Pass**: The app does not make any API calls.

19. **Verify App has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.**
    - **Not Evaluated**: This step requires comparing the DOM tree structure and classes with the original application, which is not possible in this static evaluation.

20. **Verify that the code is migrated to Angular 14.x.**
    - **Pass**: The code is migrated to Angular 14.x.
