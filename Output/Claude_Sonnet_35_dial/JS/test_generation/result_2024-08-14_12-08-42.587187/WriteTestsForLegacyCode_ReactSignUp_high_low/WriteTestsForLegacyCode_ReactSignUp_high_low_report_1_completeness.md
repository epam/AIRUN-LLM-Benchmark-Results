7. **Pass**: Verify that the FormGroup component is tested for rendering children without error messages.
    - The test `renders children` in the `FormGroup Component` section covers this scenario.

8. **Fail**: Check that all PropTypes are validated in the tests.
    - The provided code does not include checks for PropTypes validation.

9. **Pass**: Ensure that the tests are passing without any errors.
    - The provided code does not indicate any errors in the tests.

10. **Pass**: Check that all required fields in the Signup component are tested for validation errors.

11. **Pass**: Verify that the tests handle both synchronous and asynchronous operations correctly.
    - The tests include both synchronous (`validate function`) and asynchronous (`asyncValidate function`) operations.

12. **Pass**: Ensure that the tests include edge cases for form input values (e.g., minimum and maximum length for name, invalid email format).
