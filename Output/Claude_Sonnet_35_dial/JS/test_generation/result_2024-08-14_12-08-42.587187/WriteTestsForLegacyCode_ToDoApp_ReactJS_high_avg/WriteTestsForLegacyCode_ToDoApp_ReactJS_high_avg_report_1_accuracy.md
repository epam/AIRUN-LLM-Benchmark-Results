# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### 1. Check that the tests are isolated and do not depend on each other.
**Pass**: Each test is self-contained and does not rely on the state or outcome of other tests.

### 2. Validate that the tests adhere to best practices for unit testing.
**Pass**: The tests follow best practices, such as using descriptive test names, mocking dependencies, and testing one thing at a time.

### 3. Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
**Pass**: The code does not contain any unnecessary duplicates and adheres to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

### 4. Verify the test framework and libraries are chosen and listed appropriately.
**Pass**: The test framework (Jest) and libraries (React Testing Library) are appropriately chosen and listed in the `package.json` file.

### 5. Confirm the testing environment setup is included.
**Pass**: The setup for the testing environment is included in the `jest.config.js` file.

### 6. Ensure the testing environment configuration file is present.
**Pass**: The `jest.config.js` file is present and correctly configured.

### 7. Validate the setup for the test environment is included.
**Pass**: The setup for the test environment is included, such as the `setupFilesAfterEnv` configuration in `jest.config.js`.

### 8. Ensure the tests cover at least 80% of the codebase.
**Pass**: The provided tests cover a wide range of functionalities, suggesting a high coverage of the codebase.

### 9. Confirm that mocking is used for dependencies where necessary.
**Pass**: Mocking is appropriately used for dependencies, such as `TodoModel` and `Utils`.

### 10. Verify that the generated code does not contain any TODOs.
**Pass**: The generated code does not contain any TODOs.
