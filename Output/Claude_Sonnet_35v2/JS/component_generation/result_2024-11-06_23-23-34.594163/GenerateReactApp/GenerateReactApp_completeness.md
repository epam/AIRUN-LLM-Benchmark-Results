# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Ensure that the API call to https://swapi.dev/api/people is made using axios.
**Pass**: The API call to `https://swapi.dev/api/people` is made using axios in the `fetchCharacters` function within `api.ts`.

### Step 2: Make sure the data is fetched initially without any input fields.
**Pass**: The data is fetched initially in the `useEffect` hook in `App.tsx` without any input fields.

### Step 3: Ensure a loader or loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass**: A loader component (`Loader.tsx`) is displayed while data is being fetched, as indicated by the `isLoading` state in `App.tsx`.

### Step 4: Verify that errors are logged to the console if the API call fails.
**Fail**: Errors are not logged to the console. Instead, an error message is displayed in the UI. To pass this step, errors should also be logged to the console.

### Step 5: Ensure that the fetched characters are displayed in a list format.
**Pass**: The fetched characters are displayed in a list format using the `CharacterList` component in `CharacterList.tsx`.

### Step 6: Make sure each list item has a unique key derived from the character URL.
**Pass**: Each list item has a unique key derived from the character URL in the `CharacterList` component.

- **Number of passed steps**: 5
- **Number of failed steps**: 1

### Recommendations
To address the failed step, modify the `loadCharacters` function in `App.tsx` to log errors to the console:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const loadCharacters = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetchCharacters();
      setCharacters(response.results);
    } catch (err) {
      console.error('Failed to load characters', err); // Log error to console
      setError('Failed to load characters');
    } finally {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }
  };

  loadCharacters();
}, []);
```

This will ensure that errors are both logged to the console and displayed in the UI.
