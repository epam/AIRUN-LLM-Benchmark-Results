# Evaluation Report

## Steps

### 1. Check that a loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass**: The code includes a loading state (`loading`) and conditionally renders a loading indicator (`<div>Loading...</div>`) when `loading` is `true`.

### 2. Verify that the loader does not hide the search input when data is loading.
**Pass**: The search input field is always rendered regardless of the loading state, ensuring it is not hidden when data is loading.

### 3. Validate that a request with an empty search term is sent on the initial render.
**Pass**: The `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array calls `fetchCharacters('')` on initial render, sending a request with an empty search term.

### 4. Verify that the search input field is present.
**Pass**: The search input field is present in the JSX (`<input type="text" ... />`).

### 5. Ensure that the character search functionality is implemented.
**Pass**: The search functionality is implemented with the `handleSearchChange` function updating the `searchQuery` state, which triggers the `debouncedFetch` function.

### 6. Ensure that the API request includes the search term as a query parameter.
**Pass**: The `fetchCharacters` function constructs the API URL with the search term as a query parameter (`?search=${search}`).

### 7. Validate that the data is loading on initial app load with empty query and then when the search term changes.
**Pass**: The initial data load is triggered by `fetchCharacters('')` in the `useEffect` hook, and subsequent data loads are triggered by changes to `searchQuery`.

### 8. Ensure that the debounced fetch function prevents unnecessary API requests.
**Pass**: The `debouncedFetch` function uses `debounce` from `lodash` to limit the frequency of API requests.

### 9. Confirm that the character list is updated based on the search results.
**Pass**: The character list is updated by setting the `characters` state with the results from the API response.

### 10. Validate that the application handles API request errors.
**Pass**: The `fetchCharacters` function includes a `try-catch` block to handle errors, setting the `error` state and displaying an error message.

### 11. Ensure that the user experience remains smooth without backend overloads.
**Pass**: The use of debouncing and conditional rendering ensures a smooth user experience without overloading the backend.
