# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Confirm that constraints related to local storage limitations are noted.**
   - **Pass**: The answer mentions local storage limitations under "Constraints & Assumptions" and "Scalability Considerations".

2. **Verify that assumptions about the application being designed for a single user are mentioned.**
   - **Pass**: The answer states the assumption of a single-user context under "Constraints & Assumptions".

3. **Ensure that browser compatibility assumptions are included.**
   - **Pass**: The answer mentions the assumption of browser support for localStorage under "Constraints & Assumptions".

4. **Check that performance-related constraints are noted.**
   - **Pass**: The answer discusses performance optimizations and constraints under "Performance & Scalability".

5. **Confirm that performance optimizations, such as the use of `shouldComponentUpdate`, are identified.**
   - **Pass**: The answer identifies the use of `shouldComponentUpdate` for performance optimization.

6. **Verify that considerations for using immutable data structures for performance are mentioned.**
   - **Pass**: The answer mentions the use of immutable operations (map, filter, reduce) for performance.

7. **Ensure scalability considerations related to local storage limitations are discussed.**
   - **Pass**: The answer discusses local storage limitations under "Scalability Considerations".

8. **Check that the potential need for a backend service for better scalability is mentioned.**
   - **Fail**: The answer does not mention the potential need for a backend service for better scalability.

9. **Confirm that the evaluation steps are unambiguous and concise.**
   - **Pass**: The evaluation steps are clear and concise.

10. **Ensure that each step allows the evaluator to assess the output based solely on the provided code.**
    - **Pass**: Each step allows the evaluator to assess the output based on the provided code.

11. **Verify that the steps are clearly articulated and cover all main points of the task.**
    - **Pass**: The steps are clearly articulated and cover the main points of the task.

### Summary

- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 11
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 10
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 1

Overall, the evaluation steps are well-defined and cover most of the critical aspects of the task, with one minor omission regarding the potential need for a backend service for better scalability.
