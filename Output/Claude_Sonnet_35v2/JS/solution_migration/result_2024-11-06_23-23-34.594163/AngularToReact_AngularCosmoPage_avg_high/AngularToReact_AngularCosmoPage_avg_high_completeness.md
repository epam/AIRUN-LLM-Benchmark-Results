# Evaluation Report

## Step 1: Confirm that the state slices for page and user are correctly defined and managed.

- **Pass**: The `pageSlice` and `userSlice` are correctly defined using `createSlice` from `@reduxjs/toolkit`. The initial states are properly set, and the reducers `setPage`, `resetPage`, `setUser`, and `resetUser` are correctly implemented.

## Step 2: Verify that API service functions are correctly defined and used.

- **Pass**: The API service functions in `api/rest.ts` are correctly defined using `axios`. The functions for `blocks` and `content` endpoints (get, create, update, delete) are properly implemented and used in `PageEditor.tsx`.

## Step 3: Ensure that the application correctly handles all the functionalities from the original Angular code.

- **Pass**: The application handles functionalities such as loading a page, saving a page, duplicating a page, and deleting a page. The `PageEditor` component uses `useEffect` to load the page data and dispatches actions to update the Redux state.

## Step 4: Verify that all functionalities like save, delete, update, and tag management are working correctly.

- **Pass**: The `PageEditor` component includes functions `handleSave`, `handleDelete`, and `loadPage` to manage save, delete, and update functionalities. The tag management is handled through the `localPage` state.

## Step 5: Ensure that the application performs all CRUD operations correctly.

- **Pass**: The CRUD operations are correctly implemented in the `PageEditor` component. The `RestAPI.content` methods are used to perform create, read, update, and delete operations.

## Step 6: Verify that the application handles local storage and state persistence correctly.

- **Fail**: The provided code does not include any implementation for handling local storage or state persistence. This functionality is not addressed in the current implementation.
