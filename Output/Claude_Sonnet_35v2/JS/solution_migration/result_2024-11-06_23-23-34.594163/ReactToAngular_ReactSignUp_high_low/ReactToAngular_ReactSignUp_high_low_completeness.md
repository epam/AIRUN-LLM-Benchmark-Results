# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Verify that all React components and their functionalities are correctly translated into Angular components.
- **Pass**: The provided code includes Angular components (`SignupComponent` and `FormGroupComponent`) that replicate the functionalities of the React components.

### Step 2: Ensure that the form validation logic is implemented using Angular reactive forms.
- **Pass**: The `signupForm` is created using Angular's `FormBuilder` with appropriate validation rules.

### Step 3: Check that the application includes the necessary form controls and validation rules.
- **Pass**: The form includes controls for `name`, `email`, and `password` with required validation rules such as `Validators.required`, `Validators.minLength`, `Validators.maxLength`, and `Validators.email`.

### Step 4: Confirm that the application correctly binds the form controls and handles form submission.
- **Pass**: The form controls are correctly bound using `formControlName` and the form submission is handled by the `onSubmit` method.

### Step 5: Ensure the application correctly displays form validation errors.
- **Pass**: The `FormGroupComponent` is used to display validation errors, and the error messages are correctly defined based on the validation rules.

### Step 6: Verify that the application contains actions for signup, signup success, and signup failure.
- **Pass**: The `onSubmit` method dispatches the `signupComplete` action on successful signup. Error handling is also present, although it does not dispatch a failure action.

### Step 7: Ensure that the auth.effects.ts file correctly handles side effects using @ngrx/effects, including calling the API and dispatching success or failure actions.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include the `auth.effects.ts` file, so it cannot be verified if side effects are handled correctly using `@ngrx/effects`.

### Step 8: Validate that the API call to signup is correctly integrated and that the response is handled properly.
- **Pass**: The API call to `signup` is correctly integrated in the `onSubmit` method, and the response is handled by dispatching the `signupComplete` action and managing the `submitting` state.

### Step 9: Confirm that the application navigates to the login page correctly when the link is clicked.
- **Pass**: The link to navigate to the login page is correctly implemented using `routerLink="/login"`.
