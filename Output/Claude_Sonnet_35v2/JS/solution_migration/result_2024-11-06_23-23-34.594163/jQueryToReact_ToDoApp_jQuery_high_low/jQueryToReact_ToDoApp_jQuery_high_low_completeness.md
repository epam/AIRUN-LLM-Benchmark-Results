# Evaluation Report

## Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
**Pass**: The `Header` component contains an input field with the class `new-todo`. The `handleSubmit` function is triggered on the `onKeyDown` event, and it dispatches the `addTodo` action when the Enter key is pressed.

## Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
**Pass**: The `TodoList` component uses the `getFilteredTodos` function to filter todos based on the current filter state and displays them using the `TodoItem` component.

## Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
**Pass**: The `App` component includes a checkbox with the class `toggle-all` that dispatches the `toggleAll` action when its state changes.

## Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
**Pass**: The `TodoItem` component includes functionality to toggle the completion status (`toggleTodo`), edit the title (`updateTodo`), and delete the todo (`deleteTodo`).

## Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
**Pass**: The `TodoItem` component starts editing on double-clicking the label, submits the edited todo on pressing Enter, and resets the editing state on pressing Esc.

## Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
**Pass**: The `Footer` component displays the count of active items, includes filter links, and has a button to clear completed items.

## Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
**Pass**: The `Footer` component includes a button with the class `clear-completed` that dispatches the `clearCompleted` action when clicked.
