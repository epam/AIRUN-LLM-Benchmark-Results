- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation approach is thoroughly evaluated

    The analysis provides detailed evaluation of the form validation approach in several places:
    - Section 1.2 (Complex Promise Handling) analyzes and improves the asyncValidate function
    - Section 5.1 (Outdated Form Handling Pattern) proposes modern validation with react-hook-form and yup
    - A dedicated custom hook for validation is proposed in Section 4.1

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure error handling mechanisms are comprehensively assessed

    Error handling is comprehensively assessed in:
    - Section 5.2 specifically focuses on error handling improvements
    - Section 7.1 addresses inconsistent promise handling
    - Section 3.2 discusses proper error state notification for accessibility

- **Pass** (100%): Verify state management for form data is properly analyzed

    The review analyzes state management for form data in:
    - Section 1.1 (modernizing from redux-form to react hooks)
    - Section 5.1 (proposing modern form libraries)
    - Section 7.2 (handling loading states)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm component structure and responsibilities are evaluated

    Component structure and responsibilities are evaluated in:
    - Section 6.1 (Tightly Coupled Components)

    - Section 6.2 (Prop Types Definition)
    - Section 3.1 (adding proper form labels and props)
    - Section 6.1 (defining clean component interfaces between container/presentation components)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify component lifecycle management is analyzed

    Component lifecycle management is analyzed in:
    - Section 2.1 (unnecessary re-renders)
    - Section 1.1 (modernizing from class components to functional components with hooks)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm API call patterns and error handling are evaluated

    API call patterns and error handling are thoroughly evaluated in:
    - Section 7 (API Integration) with subsections on promise handling and loading states
    - Section 4.1 (separating API calls from component logic)
    - Section 2.2 (optimizing API calls with debouncing)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure promise handling and asynchronous operations are assessed

    Promise handling and asynchronous operations are assessed in:
    - Section 1.2 (Complex Promise Handling)
    - Section 7.1 (Inconsistent Promise Handling)
    - Section 2.2 (Inefficient Promise Handling)
