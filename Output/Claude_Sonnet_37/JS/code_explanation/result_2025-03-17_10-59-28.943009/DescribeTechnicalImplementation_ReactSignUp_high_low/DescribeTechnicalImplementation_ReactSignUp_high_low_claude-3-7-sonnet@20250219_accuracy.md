- **Fail** (95%): Ensure that accessibility features are accurately documented with correct ARIA roles and attributes

    While the document mentions that Bootstrap's Input component provides appropriate ARIA attributes and describes some accessibility considerations, it contains a contradiction by first stating "The form uses Bootstrap's Input component which provides appropriate ARIA attributes" but later recommending improvements like "The component should be enhanced with explicit labels instead of relying solely on placeholders." The documentation also mentions that "Form labels are implemented through placeholders," which is not an accessibility best practice. This inconsistency suggests the accessibility documentation may not be fully accurate regarding the implementation of ARIA roles and attributes.
