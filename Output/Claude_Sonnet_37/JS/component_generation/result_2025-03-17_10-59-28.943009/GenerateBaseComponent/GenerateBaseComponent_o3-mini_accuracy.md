# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  The implementation uses React’s modern functional component style with hooks, which is consistent with React 18.x practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  The files have a .tsx extension, proper interfaces (e.g., Option, SearchableSelectProps) are defined, and the code uses TypeScript features extensively.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  The provided code includes an index.css file with comprehensive styles, ensuring the component’s appearance.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  The code is well-commented, follows clean coding practices, and does not include any TODO comments or placeholder code.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  The component leverages useState for managing dropdown visibility, search term, and highlighted index; it also handles the selected value appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  The component accepts various props (such as options, placeholder, onChange, value, className, id, and disabled), making it flexible and reusable in different contexts.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  The implementation handles several keyboard events (Enter, Escape, ArrowDown, ArrowUp, Home, End) for navigation and option selection, meeting accessibility and usability expectations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  Refs are correctly used via useRef for container, input, options, and individual option elements, ensuring proper DOM interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  The code manages focus by returning it to the input when necessary and scrolling the highlighted option into view, confirming good focus management.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  ARIA attributes such as aria-expanded, aria-haspopup, aria-controls, aria-activedescendant, role="combobox", and role="option" are used correctly to ensure accessibility support.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  Based on static analysis, the code appears free of errors and warnings. However, without running the code in a live environment, there is a minor uncertainty about potential runtime warnings that might only appear under specific conditions.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  The component is structured to update state only when required, and the use of refs and effects is appropriate. Nonetheless, performance optimizations like memoization for highly dynamic lists aren’t explicitly applied. While not strictly necessary for every case, in scenarios with a massive amount of options, additional optimization might be considered. This cautious note yields a slightly lower confidence level.
