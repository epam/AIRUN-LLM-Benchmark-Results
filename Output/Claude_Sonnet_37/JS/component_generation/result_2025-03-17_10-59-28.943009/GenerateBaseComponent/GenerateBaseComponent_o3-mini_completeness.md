# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component renders a container with a clickable "select-control" that toggles the visibility of a dropdown (the div with class "select-options"). This confirms the presence of a dropdown UI element.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  The code includes an input element (with class "select-input") that is used to filter options when the dropdown is open, demonstrating that a search input is part of the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The implementation supports single selection by invoking the onChange handler with a single Option or null, thereby confirming that only one item is selected at a time.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The handleKeyDown function handles ArrowDown and ArrowUp events to update the highlighted index, allowing the user to navigate through the options with keyboard arrow keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  The Enter key event is handled to both open the dropdown (if closed) and to select an option (if an option is highlighted), thus enabling selection via the Enter key.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  When the Enter key is pressed and the dropdown is not open, the handleToggleDropdown function is called to open it. This confirms that the dropdown’s visibility can be toggled using the Enter key.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  After an option is selected or the dropdown is closed via the Escape key, the code sets focus back to the input element (via inputRef.current?.focus()), ensuring focus is restored to the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  The onClick handler on each option calls handleOptionSelect, which sets isOpen to false, closing the dropdown when an option is clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  The keyboard handling, specifically the Enter key case, also calls handleOptionSelect to close the dropdown after an option is selected. This confirms keyboard-based selection leads to closing the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  The handleKeyDown function processes the Escape key to set isOpen to false and returns focus to the select component, ensuring the dropdown closes when Escape is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  The useEffect hook with the mousedown event listener checks for clicks outside the component’s container and sets isOpen to false in such cases, confirming the proper closing behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  When the component is focused and the Enter key is pressed while the dropdown is closed, the handleToggleDropdown function is invoked, which opens the dropdown as required.
