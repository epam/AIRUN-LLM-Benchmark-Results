# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The application fetches character data from the SWAPI API (`https://swapi.dev/api/people`) and displays them in a list using the `CharacterList` component. The component maps through the characters array and renders each character's name.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The application implements a loading state with a spinner animation. When `isLoading` is true, it renders a div with class "loading-container" that includes a spinner element and "Loading characters..." text.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The code maps through all characters in the fetched data array (`characters.map((character, index) => ...)`) and renders each one as a list item, ensuring all fetched characters are displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  The provided code doesn't contain any search functionality, filters, or user input fields. It only displays the list of characters fetched from the API.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character is rendered as a list item with the character name shown in a span element with the class "character-name". The relevant code is `<span className="character-name">{character.name}</span>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The implementation begins with instructions to bootstrap the project using Create React App with TypeScript: `npx create-react-app star-wars-characters --template typescript`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The application uses React's `useState` hook to manage three states:
  - `characters` - to store the fetched character data
  - `isLoading` - to track loading state during API calls
  - `error` - to store any error messages from failed API calls

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  The code uses array indices as keys: `<li key={index} className="character-item">`. While this works for static lists, it's not the most robust solution if the list order changes. Ideally, a unique identifier from the API (like character.url) would be better. However, the implementation still passes the requirement of providing keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  The application handles empty data states through its error and loading handling. If no data is returned, the characters array would be empty, and the list would simply render without items. Additionally, error states are captured and displayed to the user with a retry button.
