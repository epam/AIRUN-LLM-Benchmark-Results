# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The CharacterList component fetches data from the SWAPI API and displays the characters in a list.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The component conditionally renders a loading spinner and a loading message when isLoading is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  The code maps over the fetched character array (data.results) and displays each character’s name in an unordered list.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  The implementation focuses solely on displaying the characters, aside from an error retry button, with no search or additional input.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each list item clearly renders the character’s name from the fetched data.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The project is bootstrapped using Create React App with the TypeScript template, as indicated in the project setup instructions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The use of useState hooks for isLoading, error, and characters is appropriate, and side effects are managed with useEffect.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  Although the code provides keys for each list item via the index, using indexes is not considered optimal when unique identifiers (such as character.url) are available. This practice can lead to potential rendering issues if the list order changes.  
  (Confidence is 90% because while indexes do generate unique keys in this static list scenario, they do not represent the best practice for unique and stable identifiers.)

- **Fail** (85%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  The implementation does not include a specific conditional branch to handle the case when the fetched characters array is empty (i.e., displaying an "empty state" message). This could leave the user with an empty UI without proper feedback.  
  (Confidence is 85% because although rendering an empty unordered list might be acceptable in some contexts, a dedicated empty state message would enhance user experience.)
