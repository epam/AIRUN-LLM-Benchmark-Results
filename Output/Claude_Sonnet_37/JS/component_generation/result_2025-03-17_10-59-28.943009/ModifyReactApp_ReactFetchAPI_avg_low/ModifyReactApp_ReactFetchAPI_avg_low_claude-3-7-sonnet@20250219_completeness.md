# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name
  
  The implementation includes a search input field with proper event handling (`handleSearchChange`) and integration with the Star Wars API search endpoint.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests
  
  The code includes two loading indicators:
  1. `{loading && <div className="search-indicator">Searching...</div>}` - shown during search
  2. `{loading && !searchQuery && <div className="loading">Loading characters...</div>}` - shown during initial load

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query
  
  The implementation uses a useEffect hook to fetch initial data when the component mounts:
  ```jsx
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchCharacters();
  }, [fetchCharacters]);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type
  
  The implementation uses a debounced search function to update results as the user types:
  ```jsx
  const handleSearchChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    const query = e.target.value;
    setSearchQuery(query);
    debouncedSearch(query);
  };
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found
  
  The code includes a dedicated element for showing a "no results" message:
  ```jsx
  {!loading && characters.length === 0 && !error && (
    <div className="no-results">No characters found. Try a different search term.</div>
  )}
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design
  
  The CSS includes media queries for smaller screens:
  ```css
  @media (max-width: 600px) {
    .character-list-container {
      padding: 15px;
    }
    
    .search-input {
      padding: 10px;
      font-size: 14px;
    }
    
    .character-item {
      padding: 12px;
    }
  }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response
  
  The character list is rendered conditionally based on the API response:
  ```jsx
  {!loading && characters.length > 0 && (
    <ul className="character-list">
      {characters.map((character) => (
        <li key={character.url} className="character-item">
          {character.name}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )}
  ```

- **Pass** (80%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed
  
  The code includes basic error handling with try/catch and displays error messages:
  ```jsx
  catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch characters:', error);
    setError('Failed to fetch characters. Please try again later.');
    setCharacters([]);
  }
  ```
  
  However, it doesn't implement React Error Boundaries which would be ideal for production applications to handle unexpected errors during rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props
  
  The implementation defines TypeScript interfaces for data structures:
  ```typescript
  interface Character {
    name: string;
    url: string;
  }

  interface ApiResponse {
    count: number;
    next: string | null;
    previous: string | null;
    results: Character[];
  }
  ```
  
  Component props are also properly typed with React.FC.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities
  
  The implementation enhances the original functionality by adding search while maintaining the core character listing capability. It properly handles all states: loading, error, empty results, and successful searches.
