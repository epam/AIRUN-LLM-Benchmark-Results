# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type  
  The input element is correctly bound via the value prop to the searchQuery state, and the onChange event calls handleSearchChange which updates the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls  
  The code uses lodash.debounce with a 500ms delay, which falls within the 300-500ms range.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured  
  Axios is correctly imported and used with axios.get<ApiResponse>, and the API endpoint URL is constructed properly based on the search query.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses  
  TypeScript interfaces (Character, ApiResponse) are defined and used in the component. The component is also typed as React.FC, and event handlers are appropriately typed.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters  
  The API URL is conditionally constructed by appending `?search=${query}` only when there is a search query, which demonstrates correct endpoint construction.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate  
  useCallback is used for the fetchCharacters function to avoid unnecessary re-renders, and useMemo is used to implement the debounced search function.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback  
  The try/catch block in fetchCharacters handles API call errors, logs them, updates the error state, and provides user feedback by displaying an error message.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing  
  The use of lodash.debounce ensures that API calls are only made after the user stops typing for 500ms.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices  
  The component leverages React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) for state management, which aligns with React best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code  
  There are no unused imports or commented-out code segments, ensuring a clean and production-ready code form.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests  
  The loading state is adequately handled; it is set to true before an API request and reset to false in the finally block, ensuring accurate loading indicators.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns  
  The component uses current React 18.x patterns by employing functional components and hooks, ensuring modern and optimized React practices.
