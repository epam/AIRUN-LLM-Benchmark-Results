# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The code includes an input field with placeholder "Search characters...", and the onChange handler (handleSearchChange) properly triggers the debounce search function.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  The implementation shows a loading indicator using conditional rendering (e.g., the "search-indicator" and "loading" divs) when the loading state is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  The useEffect hook calls fetchCharacters() on mount without a query, ensuring that initial data is loaded as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  The debounced search function is implemented and triggered on every input change, ensuring that the results are updated dynamically.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  When the API returns an empty results set (and there is no error), the UI displays a message ("No characters found. Try a different search term.") to inform the user.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The CSS file contains media queries that adjust styles for smaller screen sizes, confirming the responsive design of the search component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  The code maps over the characters array to display a list of character names once the API response is received.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  The fetchCharacters function has error handling in place. When an error occurs during API fetching, an error message is set and displayed, providing user feedback. While this isnâ€™t a React Error Boundary component, it correctly handles API errors in the context of the search functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The code defines interfaces for Character and ApiResponse and properly types the React component, ensuring TypeScript is leveraged appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The implementation retains the initial character fetching on mount and incorporates new search capabilities without impacting existing functionality.
