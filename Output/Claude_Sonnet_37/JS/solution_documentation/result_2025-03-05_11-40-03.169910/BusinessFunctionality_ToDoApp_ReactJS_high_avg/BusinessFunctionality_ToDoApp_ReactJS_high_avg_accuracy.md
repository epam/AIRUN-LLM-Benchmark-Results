# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Confirm that constraints related to local storage limitations are noted.
**Pass** - The report mentions that localStorage has size limits (typically 5-10MB).

### Step 2: Verify that assumptions about the application being designed for a single user are mentioned.
**Pass** - The report states that the application assumes a single user per browser/device and mentions no user authentication or authorization mechanisms.

### Step 3: Ensure that browser compatibility assumptions are included.
**Pass** - The report notes that the application assumes modern browsers with localStorage support and relies on ES6 features and React DOM manipulation.

### Step 4: Check that performance-related constraints are noted.
**Pass** - The report discusses performance considerations, including optimized rendering and efficient state management.

### Step 5: Confirm that performance optimizations, such as the use of `shouldComponentUpdate`, are identified.
**Pass** - The report mentions the implementation of `shouldComponentUpdate` in TodoItem to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

### Step 6: Verify that considerations for using immutable data structures for performance are mentioned.
**Pass** - The report notes the use of immutable data patterns (map, filter, reduce) instead of direct mutations.

### Step 7: Ensure scalability considerations related to local storage limitations are discussed.
**Pass** - The report discusses localStorage size limits and the fact that all todos are loaded into memory at once.

### Step 8: Check that the potential need for a backend service for better scalability is mentioned.
**Fail** - The report does not explicitly mention the potential need for a backend service for better scalability.

### Step 9: Confirm that the evaluation steps are unambiguous and concise.
**Pass** - The evaluation steps are clear and concise.

### Step 10: Ensure that each step allows the evaluator to assess the output based solely on the provided code.
**Pass** - Each step is designed to allow assessment based on the provided code.

### Step 11: Verify that the steps are clearly articulated and cover all main points of the task.
**Pass** - The steps are clearly articulated and cover the main points of the task.
