- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation correctly identifies the document title management using react-document-title
- **Pass** (95%): Validate that the documentation accurately describes the integration with React Router for navigation

    While the documentation mentions "Link to login page for existing users" in the User Interface Elements section, which implies React Router is being used for navigation, it doesn't explicitly mention React Router by name. However, the context strongly suggests React Router integration for the login page link, which is why I'm rating this as a pass with 95% confidence rather than 100%.
