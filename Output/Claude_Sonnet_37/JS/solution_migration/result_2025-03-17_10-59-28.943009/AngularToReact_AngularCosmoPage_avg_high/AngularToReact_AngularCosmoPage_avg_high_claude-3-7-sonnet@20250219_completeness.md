# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (95%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented

    The implementation includes most page management functionality including create, update, and delete operations through the Redux actions (savePage, deletePage) and the PageActions component. However, the implementation appears incomplete as the PageForm component is cut off in the middle. The code for form submission with validation is missing, which is essential for the create and update functionalities to work properly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present

    Page type selection functionality is clearly implemented in the code. The pageSlice.ts includes an updatePageType action, and selectPageType selector shows this functionality is supported. We can see this is a core part of the page state management.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists

    While the code includes state management for the URL field (selectPageUrl selector), there is no visible implementation of auto-generating URLs from the title. This functionality would typically be in the PageForm component, which is incomplete in the provided code.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented

    Tag management with autocomplete is implemented through the following features:
    - searchTags async thunk in pageSlice.ts
    - updatePageTags and updatePageSuggestions actions
    - selectPageTags and selectPageSuggestions selectors
    - The code structure shows support for both storing tags and retrieving tag suggestions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available

    The publish status options are implemented as evidenced by:
    - The Page interface includes publish and scheduleDate fields
    - The selectPagePublish and selectPageScheduleDate selectors 
    - The translations include "publish", "draft", and "schedule" keys

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented

    The scheduled publishing functionality is implemented through:
    - The Page interface includes a scheduleDate field of type Date | string
    - The selectPageScheduleDate selector retrieves this value
    - The translations include "schedule" key

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present

    Local storage version comparison and restoration features are well-implemented:
    - useLocalStorage custom hook for managing stored values
    - VersionControl component specifically for handling newer versions
    - setNewerVersion action in the pageSlice
    - Functions for deleting newer versions or using local versions

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented

    The notification system is fully implemented:
    - A dedicated notificationSlice for state management
    - Notification component for displaying messages
    - addNotification, removeNotification, clearNotifications actions
    - Used throughout the application for success/error feedback

- **Fail** (80%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present

    While there are translation strings for validation messages (like page_no_type_selected and page_no_url), the actual validation implementation is not visible in the provided code since the PageForm component is incomplete. The structure suggests validation was planned but not fully shown in the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled

    The API endpoints are thoroughly implemented in the endpoints.ts file:
    - Generic CRUD operations
    - Specific endpoints for content, revisions, extras, tags
    - All the nested resources and operations

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented

    Extras management is comprehensively implemented:
    - The Page interface includes an extras field of type Record<string, any>
    - API endpoints for managing extras (create, delete)
    - Logic in the savePage thunk for handling extras for both content and revisions

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained

    Revision history functionality is maintained through:
    - PageRevision interface
    - API endpoints for content revisions
    - Logic in the savePage thunk that creates new revisions when saving pages

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components

    The code follows modern React best practices with excellent organization:
    - Feature folders (page, user, notification)
    - Separation of UI components in the components directory
    - Business logic
