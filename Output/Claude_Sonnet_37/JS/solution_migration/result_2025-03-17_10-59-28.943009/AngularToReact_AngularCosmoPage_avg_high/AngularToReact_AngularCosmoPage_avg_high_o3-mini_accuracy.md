# Evaluation Report

- **Pass (95%)**: Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props  
  The codebase shows TypeScript files (.ts and .tsx) and defines interfaces for models (e.g., Page and User). Components and Redux slices include type annotations on props and state. However, there are some minor areas where stricter typings (such as for certain dynamic values) could be enhanced. This is why the confidence is at 95%.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management  
  Redux slices using createSlice and createAsyncThunk are implemented in features (page, user, notification). The store uses configureStore from Redux Toolkit.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components  
  All components (e.g., Button, Notification, VersionControl, PageActions) are implemented as functional components utilizing React.FC.

- **Pass (95%)**: Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately  
  The codebase leverages multiple hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useCallback across hooks and components. Dependency arrays are mostly correctly used. A few cases (e.g., in the custom hook useLocalStorage) include eslint disable comments for dependency rules, but overall, the implementation is appropriate.

- **Pass (100%)**: Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource  
  The API layer uses axios (via apiClient and endpoints modules) for HTTP requests, which meets the requirement clearly.

- **Pass (90%)**: Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components  
  While the provided snippet for PageForm is incomplete, the overall project structure implies that form inputs will be controlled. Additional implementation details are expected in the complete PageForm, so there is a high degree of confidence for controlled components, though the evidence is partial.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation  
  The usage of useParams and useNavigate from react-router-dom confirms the integration of React Router for navigation purposes.

- **Fail (100%)**: Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization  
  The project implements a custom useTranslation hook with a static translations object. While it provides basic translation functionality, it does not leverage a well-established i18n library (e.g., i18next) that would be expected for a production-level application.

- **Fail (100%)**: Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization  
  There is no evidence of code splitting (for example, using React.lazy or dynamic import) in the provided codebase, which is important for optimizing large-scale React applications.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations  
  The Button component is wrapped with React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders, confirming the use of memoization where appropriate.

- **Pass (90%)**: Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks  
  Dependency arrays are present in useEffect and useCallback hooks. Although there is an eslint disable comment in one instance (in useLocalStorage), in general, dependencies appear to be managed correctly.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models  
  Interfaces for the data models (e.g., Page, PageRevision, and User) are clearly defined and used throughout the codebase.

- **Pass (100%)**: Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state  
  The code provides specific selector files (pageSelectors.ts and userSelectors.ts), with functions to access slices of the state.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations  
  Action creators are defined within the Redux slices (e.g., updatePageField, setNewerVersion, confirmDelete, etc.), ensuring proper state management.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks  
  The useLocalStorage hook is implemented to handle localStorage interactions in a type-safe and reusable way.
