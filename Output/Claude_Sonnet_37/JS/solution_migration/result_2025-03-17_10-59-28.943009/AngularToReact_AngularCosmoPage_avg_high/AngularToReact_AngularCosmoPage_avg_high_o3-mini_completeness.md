# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
  The provided code implements the page management functionality through asynchronous thunks (fetchPage, savePage, deletePage) and separate Redux actions for duplication. This indicates that all operations are considered.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
  The pageSlice includes an action (updatePageType) for updating the page type, confirming that the functionality exists.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
  There is no explicit implementation in the provided code for auto-generating the URL from the title. The code expects a URL field in the Page model, but the logic to derive the URL from the title is missing.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
  The code includes a searchTags async thunk and manages tag suggestions (stored in currentPage.suggestions) as well as tag creation and deletion, supporting tag management with autocomplete suggestions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
  The Page model contains fields (publish, published, published_date, scheduleDate) and the translations include labels for publish, draft, and schedule, indicating support for multiple publish status options.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
  The Page model includes a scheduleDate field and translations for scheduling. While the infrastructure is present, the actual UI or logic explicitly handling scheduling is not fully evident in the provided snippets. Thus, confidence is slightly less than 100%.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
  The VersionControl component and useLocalStorage hook demonstrate that local storage is used to compare and restore versions, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
  A complete notification system is implemented using a notification slice, a Notification component, and integration with actions in PageActions to display messages.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
  Although there are translation keys for validating URL and page type, there is no explicit implementation of form validation logic in the provided components. This functionality is missing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
  The API client and endpoints are organized comprehensively, covering CRUD operations and even nested endpoints (e.g., for tags, extras, revisions). All endpoints appear to be properly implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
  The code includes endpoints and thunk logic for managing extras on content and revisions, effectively addressing extras management.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
  Revision history is handled by calling API endpoints for revisions (e.g., API.content.revisions.create) and even for revision extras, ensuring that revisions are maintained.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
  The project structure separates models, API, hooks, features (Redux slices and selectors), components, and utilities, clearly delineating business logic from UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
  A dedicated useTranslation hook along with translation records confirms that translation functionality is preserved.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
  The use of URL parameters (e.g., via useParams in VersionControl) and the navigation logic in PageActions (e.g., navigate(`/${page.url}`)) indicate that the URL structure and parameters are maintained.
