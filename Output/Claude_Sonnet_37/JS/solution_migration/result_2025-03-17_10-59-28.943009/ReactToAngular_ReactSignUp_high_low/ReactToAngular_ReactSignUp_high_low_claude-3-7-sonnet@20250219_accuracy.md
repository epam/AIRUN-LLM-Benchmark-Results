# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling
  
  The SignupComponent class clearly imports FormBuilder, FormGroup, and Validators from '@angular/forms', and creates a FormGroup in the ngOnInit method using the FormBuilder service.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)
  
  The form in SignupComponent includes all the required validations:
  - Name: Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3), Validators.maxLength(60)
  - Email: Validators.required, Validators.email
  - Password: Validators.required, Validators.minLength(6)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use
  
  The form includes async validators for both name and email using nameAsyncValidator and emailAsyncValidator methods, which make API calls to check if the name and email are already in use.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched
  
  The FormGroupComponent applies different CSS classes based on the validation state:
  - 'form-group has-success has-feedback' when valid and touched
  - 'form-group has-error has-feedback' when invalid and touched
  - Default 'form-group' when not touched

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions
  
  The onSubmit method calls apiService.signup() with the form values and dispatches the signupComplete action with the response data on success.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails
  
  The form-group.component.html template includes a span that displays error messages when the control is invalid and touched:
  `<span *ngIf="isInvalid && errorMessage" class="help-block">{{ errorMessage }}</span>`

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service
  
  The component imports Title from '@angular/platform-browser' and sets the title in the constructor using the getTitle function:
  `this.titleService.setTitle(getTitle('Signup'));`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management
  
  The component imports Store from '@ngrx/store' and dispatches actions (signupComplete). The app.module.ts also includes StoreModule and EffectsModule configurations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress
  
  The submit button has the [disabled] attribute that checks both if the form is submitting and if it's invalid:
  `[disabled]="submitting || signupForm.invalid"`

- **Fail** (95%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses
  
  While the code handles success responses properly by dispatching the signupComplete action, the error handling is incomplete. The error callback only sets submitting to false with a comment "// Handle error appropriately" but doesn't actually implement error handling or display error messages to the user.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management
  
  The component follows Angular best practices: proper imports, separation of concerns, lifecycle hooks (ngOnInit), use of services through dependency injection, and proper component structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises
  
  The ApiService properly uses HttpClient for all API calls, returning Observables instead of Promises.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements
  
  The getErrorMessage method in SignupComponent returns appropriate error messages for each validation error:
  - Required fields: "This field is required"
  - Name length: "Name must be between 3 and 60 characters in length"
  - Name exists: "This name is already in use"
  - Email format: "A valid email address is required"
  - Email exists: "This email is already in use"
  - Password length: "Password must be at least 6
