# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The component imports FormBuilder and uses fb.group to create a FormGroup for managing the signup form.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The component applies Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3) and Validators.maxLength(60) for the name field; Validators.required and Validators.email for the email field; and Validators.required along with Validators.minLength(6) for the password field.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  The component defines nameAsyncValidator and emailAsyncValidator methods that call the ApiService methods (isName and isEmail) and return corresponding validation errors based on the response.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The custom FormGroupComponent uses Angular’s ngClass logic to add either success or error styles based on the control’s validity and touched state. It also renders an error message when validation fails.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  In the onSubmit method, after checking form validity, the API call is made via this.apiService.signup and, upon success, dispatches the signupComplete action using the @ngrx/store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The form-group.component.html template includes a span that displays the error message when the control is invalid and touched, ensuring feedback is provided to the user.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  The SignupComponent constructor calls titleService.setTitle(getTitle('Signup')), which sets the page title appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The component dispatches an action to the store upon successful signup, and the AppModule imports StoreModule and EffectsModule to integrate state management with @ngrx.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button’s disabled state is bound to "submitting || signupForm.invalid", ensuring it is disabled when a submission is already in progress or the form is invalid.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  The API call in onSubmit uses the subscribe method with both next and error handlers, handling success by dispatching an action and error by resetting the submitting state and preparing to handle the error.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component clearly separates its logic (component class), template, and styling. Dependencies are injected in the constructor, initialization occurs in ngOnInit, and best practices for reactive form management are followed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The ApiService is implemented using Angular’s HttpClient to perform HTTP requests, avoiding the use of direct promises and leveraging Observables.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The getErrorMessage method correctly returns error messages for required fields, invalid email format, and character length validations, which align with the specified requirements.
