# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The application is using Angular 14 as specified in the title "Angular 14 Migration of Todo Application" and the implementation follows Angular 14 patterns and structures.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
  
  The code includes imports from @ngrx/store and implements proper store patterns throughout the application, with a clear store structure in the provided code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
  
  The code includes a properly implemented TodoEffects class using @ngrx/effects for handling side effects, particularly for loading and saving todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
  
  The code includes well-structured actions, reducers, and selectors in separate files following NgRx best practices. All necessary todo actions are defined, the reducer handles all actions appropriately, and selectors are implemented for various state queries.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
  
  All components use the @Component decorator, and child components properly use @Input and @Output decorators for component communication.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators
  
  The code shows proper usage of @ViewChild in the TodoItemComponent for accessing the edit field element.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
  
  The components properly use @Input() for property binding and @Output() with EventEmitter for event handling, as seen in the TodoItemComponent and TodoFooterComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
  
  The application uses a TodoService for managing data persistence and retrieval, following Angular's services architecture.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
  
  Dependency injection is properly implemented throughout the application, with services and the store injected into components.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
  
  The components appear to use Angular's default change detection. While there is no explicit use of OnPush change detection which would be ideal for performance optimization in some components, the application does use the async pipe appropriately which helps with change detection.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
  
  The code includes an AppRoutingModule with proper routes defined for the todo application.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code generally follows Angular style guide conventions with proper naming, organization, and file structure. Component files are named according to their functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
  
  TypeScript interfaces and types are well-defined and consistently used, especially for the Todo model and state interfaces.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
  
  All React JSX has been properly converted to Angular HTML templates with appropriate Angular binding syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
  
  React event handlers have been replaced with Angular event bindings like (click), (change), (keydown), etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs
  
  The provided code does not contain any TODO comments or unfinished sections.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules
  
  There is no evidence of lazy loading implementation for feature modules in the provided code. The AppRoutingModule does not show any lazy loading configuration, and all components are directly imported in the main AppModule.
