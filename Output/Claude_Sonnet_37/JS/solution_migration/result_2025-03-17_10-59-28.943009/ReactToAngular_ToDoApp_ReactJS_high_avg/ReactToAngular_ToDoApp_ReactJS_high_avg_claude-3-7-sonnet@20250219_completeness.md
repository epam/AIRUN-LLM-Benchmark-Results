# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items
  
  The implementation includes a `todo-list.component.ts` and corresponding HTML template with a proper rendering of todo items using `*ngFor` directive. The component observes the todos from the store with `this.todos$ = this.store.select(TodoSelectors.selectFilteredTodos)` and renders them in the template.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented
  
  The implementation includes a form input in the `todo-list.component.html` with proper bindings for adding new todos. The component handles the enter key press event via `handleNewTodoKeyDown` method which dispatches the `addTodo` action to the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works
  
  The implementation includes toggle functionality in both `todo-item.component.ts` and the store with proper actions and reducers. The `toggleTodo` action is dispatched when a user clicks the checkbox, and the reducer appropriately updates the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented
  
  The implementation includes a complete editing flow with double-click to edit, blur and enter to save, and escape to cancel. The `todo-item.component.ts` handles all these interactions and dispatches appropriate actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented
  
  The implementation includes a delete button in each todo item that dispatches the `deleteTodo` action. The reducer properly handles removal of the item from the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented
  
  The implementation includes a toggle-all checkbox in `todo-list.component.html` that dispatches the `toggleAll` action. The reducer properly updates all todos' completed status based on this action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works
  
  The implementation includes filter links in the footer component and the store selectors properly filter todos based on the current filter. The `selectFilteredTodos` selector handles the filtering logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The implementation shows the active count in the footer component with proper pluralization using the `Utils.pluralize` method.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items
  
  The implementation includes a "Clear completed" button in the footer that dispatches the `clearCompleted` action. The reducer properly removes all completed items.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage
  
  The implementation includes persistence to local storage through the `TodoService` and effects. When actions that modify the state are dispatched, the `saveTodos$` effect is triggered to save todos to local storage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation
  
  The implementation includes an `app-routing.module.ts` with routes for the main, active, and completed views, maintaining the same URL structure as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states
  
  The implementation handles empty states by conditionally showing the main section and footer only when todos exist, using the `*ngIf="hasTodos$ | async"` directive.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly
  
  The implementation handles form submissions properly for both adding new todos and editing existing ones. It prevents default behavior, trims input values, and handles empty values appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships
  
  The implementation organizes components in a hierarchical structure that maintains proper parent-child relationships with appropriate input and output communications between them.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved
  
  The implementation successfully migrates all business logic from the original React application to Angular, including todo creation, editing, deletion, toggling, filtering, and persistence.
