# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
   Although the migration documentation and file structure refer to "Angular 14 Migration," the code does not explicitly mention the Angular version in any file (such as package.json). However, the context and practices strongly imply Angular 14 usage.

2. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
   The application imports and configures StoreModule from '@ngrx/store' in app.module.ts and uses a dedicated NgRx store slice for todos.

3. **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
   The TodoEffects class is defined and registered in the module using EffectsModule.forRoot(), ensuring side effects are handled correctly.

4. **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
   The code clearly includes implementations for actions in todo.actions.ts, reducers in todo.reducer.ts, and selectors in todo.selectors.ts.

5. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
   All components (TodoItemComponent, TodoFooterComponent, TodoListComponent, etc.) use the @Component decorator along with @Input and @Output for data and event binding.

6. **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
   The TodoItemComponent uses the @ViewChild decorator (e.g., for 'editField'), replacing the need for React refs.

7. **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
   Property binding and event emission are implemented using @Input and @Output in the components, facilitating communication in line with Angular patterns.

8. **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
   The TodoService (annotated with @Injectable) encapsulates data operations like fetching and saving todos.

9. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
   Constructors in components and services use dependency injection (e.g., injecting Store, TodoService), following Angular's DI framework.

10. **Fail** (95%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
    The application uses the default change detection strategy rather than explicitly applying strategies like OnPush. Explicit change detection optimizations are not evident, which might be beneficial for performance in large applications.

11. **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
    The AppRoutingModule sets up routes for different filters (all, active, completed) using RouterModule.forRoot(), confirming the use of Angular Router.

12. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
    The project structure, file naming conventions (e.g., using kebab-case for component selectors and file names), and code organization are in accordance with Angular style guidelines.

13. **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
    TypeScript interfaces (e.g., the Todo interface) and associated type annotations are consistently used in models, actions, and components.

14. **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
    The React JSX code has been fully replaced with Angular HTML templates (as seen in the *.component.html files).

15. **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
    Event handlers (such as (click) and (keydown)) are correctly used in the Angular templates, replacing Reactâ€™s event handling methods.

16. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
    There are no code comments with "TODO" in the provided source code. The placeholder text "What needs to be done?" in the new-todo input is part of the user interface and not a developer reminder.

17. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
    The routing configuration directly maps routes to components without using loadChildren for lazy loading. This indicates that lazy loading for feature modules is not implemented.
