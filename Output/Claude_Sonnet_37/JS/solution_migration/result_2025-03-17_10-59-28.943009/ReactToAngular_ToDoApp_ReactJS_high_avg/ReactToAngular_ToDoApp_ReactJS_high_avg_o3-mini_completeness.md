# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The TodoListComponent uses an *ngFor directive on the observable filtered todos and, by default, the filter is set to display all todos. This confirms that all todo items will be displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoListComponent listens for the ENTER key event in its input field and dispatches the addTodo action when a valid string is entered. This implements the adding functionality correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  Toggling is handled by both the TodoItemComponent (emitting a toggle event) and the TodoListComponent (dispatching the toggleTodo action), while the reducer correctly flips the completed state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent provides editing methods (handleEdit, handleSubmit, handleKeydown) along with output events for saving or canceling edits. The parent component manages the editing state, thereby implementing the editing functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  There is a delete event emitted in the TodoItemComponent, and the TodoListComponent dispatches the deleteTodo action accordingly. The reducer filters out the deleted todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  The TodoListComponent includes a checkbox bound to a toggleAll method that dispatches the toggleAll action, updating all todo items’ completion state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  The store selectors and the routing configuration in AppRoutingModule support filtering for all, active, and completed todos. The TodoFooterComponent dispatches setFilter actions appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooterComponent receives the activeCount via @Input and uses a utility function to pluralize the word “item,” meaning it correctly displays the active items count.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The clearCompleted button in the TodoFooterComponent dispatches an action that the reducer uses to filter out completed todos from state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  The TodoService uses Utils.store to both retrieve and save the todos from/to local storage, ensuring data persistence across sessions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The AppRoutingModule defines routes for the root, 'active', and 'completed' paths, thus preserving the URL structure expected from the original application.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  The application conditionally renders the main and footer sections using an *ngIf tied to the presence of todos. Although no dedicated “empty state” message is provided, the UI appropriately reflects the absence of todos by hiding unnecessary components.  
  Explanation: The empty state UI is minimalistic but generally acceptable for this type of application. A more elaborate empty state message could improve user experience, which is why the confidence level is 90%.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  The TodoListComponent intercepts ENTER key events to submit new todos and properly prevents default behavior, ensuring correct handling of the form submission.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The code is modularized into appropriate components (TodoListComponent, TodoItemComponent, TodoFooterComponent) with clear separation of concerns and component communication via @Input and @Output.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  All functionalities (state management, todo operations, filtering, persistence, etc.) have been migrated and implemented using NgRx, services, and Angular patterns, preserving the original business logic.
