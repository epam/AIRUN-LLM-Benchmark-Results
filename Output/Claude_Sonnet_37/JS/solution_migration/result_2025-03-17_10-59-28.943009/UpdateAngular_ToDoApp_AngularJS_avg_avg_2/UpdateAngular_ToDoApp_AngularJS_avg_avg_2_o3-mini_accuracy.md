# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The package.json and module imports confirm the use of Angular version ^14.0.0.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
  The code consistently uses ES module syntax (import/export) and there is no sign of RequireJS.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
  The application imports StoreModule.forRoot in the AppModule and defines reducers using @ngrx/store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
  The AppModule imports EffectsModule.forRoot and there is a dedicated TodoEffects class managing side effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
  The code includes a comprehensive set of actions (e.g., addTodo, toggleTodo, clearCompletedTodos), reducers that update state accordingly, selectors to extract state slices, and effects to handle asynchronous tasks and persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
  The TodoStorageService is marked with @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }) ensuring proper dependency injection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
  The TodoStorageService implements methods (getTodos and storeTodos) to persist data via localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
  All components (e.g., TodoHeaderComponent, TodoListComponent, TodoItemComponent, etc.) are correctly annotated with the @Component decorator.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
  The TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective are correctly defined with the @Directive decorator.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
  The templates include Angular syntax such as *ngFor for looping over todos and *ngIf for conditional rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
  Event bindings, for example (click)="addTodo()", are correctly applied in the templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
  The templates use property binding such as [class.completed]="todo.completed" to dynamically apply class names.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
  Components like TodoMainComponent and TodoListComponent implement the OnInit lifecycle hook to initialize state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
  The Todo model is defined as a TypeScript interface, ensuring proper type usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
  Dependencies, such as the Store and TodoStorageService, are injected via constructor parameters in components and services.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code organization (use of modules, components, directives, services) generally follows Angular style guide practices. Minor stylistic variations could exist, but overall conventions are maintained.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
  Although the code appears clean with no evident issues, actual runtime checks would be necessary to be completely certain. However, based on the code structure, no obvious console errors or warnings are expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
  The application utilizes TypeScript effectively through explicit type annotations, interfaces, and modern syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
  There are no visible TODO comments or commented-out code fragments in the provided sections.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design  
  The application divides responsibilities among components (header, list, item, footer), services, directives, and state management, which aligns well with the single responsibility principle. The separation appears clear, though minor overlaps could exist in edge-case scenarios.
