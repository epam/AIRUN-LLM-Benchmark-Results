# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list  
  The application includes the TodoListComponent which is responsible for displaying the list of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos  
  The TodoHeaderComponent provides a form and logic to add new todos to the list.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos  
  The TodoItemComponent contains functionality (startEditing, doneEditing, cancelEditing) to edit a todo.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos  
  The application handles filtering through URL-based routing (in AppRoutingModule) and the TodoFooterComponent provides filter links. However, the TodoListComponent subscribes to route changes but does not explicitly dispatch a filter update to the store, relying instead on selectors with optional props. This minor ambiguity reduces the confidence slightly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics  
  The TodoFooterComponent displays the count of remaining todos, using inputs for todoCount and completedCount.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos  
  New todos are added via the TodoHeaderComponent which dispatches the addTodo action after validating the input.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos  
  Editing is implemented in the TodoItemComponent with dispatching of the editTodo action when editing is completed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos  
  The TodoItemComponent contains a removeTodo method that dispatches the removeTodo action to delete a todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed  
  Completed status is toggled in TodoItemComponent via the toggleCompleted method and the markAllTodos action is available in TodoMainComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)  
  Filtering is achieved with routes ('' for all, 'active', and 'completed') and the TodoFooterComponent provides the corresponding navigation links.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete  
  The TodoMainComponent contains an input checkbox and method (markAll) which dispatches the markAllTodos action to update all todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos  
  The TodoFooterComponent includes a "Clear completed" button that dispatches the clearCompletedTodos action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos  
  The TodoFooterComponent renders a count of items left (todoCount) ensuring that the remaining todos are clearly displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage  
  The TodoStorageService provides methods to store and retrieve todos in localStorage, and the saveTodos effect uses these methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization  
  Upon dispatching loadTodos in the TodoMainComponent, the TodoEffects loadTodos$ effect retrieves the persisted todos from localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing  
  The TodoEscapeDirective captures the escape key press and emits an event, which is handled in the TodoItemComponent to cancel editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo  
  The TodoFocusDirective listens to changes and sets focus on the input element when a todo enters editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original  
  By importing "todomvc-common" and "todomvc-app-css" styles and following the classic TodoMVC HTML structure, the visual appearance matches the original.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately  
  Both in the TodoHeaderComponent (ignoring empty titles) and in the TodoItemComponent (deleting a todo when the edited title is empty), empty todo titles are handled correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter  
  The AppRoutingModule defines clear routes for filtering, and the TodoFooterComponent uses routerLink directives to update the URL as the filter changes.
