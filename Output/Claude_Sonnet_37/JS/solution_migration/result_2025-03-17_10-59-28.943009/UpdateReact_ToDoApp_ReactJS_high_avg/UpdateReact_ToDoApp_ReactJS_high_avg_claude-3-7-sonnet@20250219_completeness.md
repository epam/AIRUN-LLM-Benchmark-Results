# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed
   
   The code includes a `TodoInput` component with a `handleKeyDown` function that checks for the Enter key (KEYS.ENTER) and dispatches the `addTodo` action when pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter
   
   The `TodoList` component filters todos based on the current filter state (all, active, completed) and renders them appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos
   
   The application includes a "toggle-all" input with an `onChange` handler that dispatches the `toggleAllTodos` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted
   
   The `TodoItem` component includes handlers for toggling (`handleToggle`), editing (`handleEdit`), and deleting (`handleDelete`) todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode
   
   The label in `TodoItem` has an `onDoubleClick` handler that calls `handleEdit`, which dispatches the `editTodo` action to set the editing state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo
   
   The `handleKeyDown` function in `TodoItem` checks for the Enter key and calls `handleSubmit` to save the edited todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value
   
   The `handleKeyDown` function in `TodoItem` checks for the Escape key (KEYS.ESCAPE), resets the edit text to the original title, and dispatches `cancelEdit`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items
   
   The `TodoFooter` component calculates `activeTodoCount` and displays it along with the properly pluralized "item" text.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)
   
   The `TodoFooter` component includes filter links for All, Active, and Completed, each with appropriate click handlers to update the filter state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos
   
   The `TodoFooter` component conditionally renders a "Clear completed" button when there are completed todos, with an `onClick` handler that dispatches `clearCompleted`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence
   
   The application includes `storageUtils` with functions for saving and retrieving todos from localStorage. These utilities are used in the Redux slice to persist state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state
   
   Various components use conditional rendering:
   - `TodoList` and `TodoFooter` only render when there are todos
   - The "Clear completed" button only appears when there are completed todos
   - UI elements adjust based on editing state

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count
   
   The application includes a `pluralize` utility function in `storageUtils` that's used in the footer to correctly pluralize "item" based on the count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components
   
   The application is well-structured with focused components:
   - `TodoApp`: Main container
   - `TodoInput`: Handles creating new todos
   - `TodoList`: Manages the list of todos
   - `TodoItem`: Handles individual todo display and interaction
   - `TodoFooter`: Manages filters and footer actions

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality
   
   The code is organized using a feature-based structure:
   - `app/`: Store and hooks
   - `features/todos/`: Todo-related components and state
   - `utils/`: Utility functions
   - `constants/`: Application constants
   - `types/`: TypeScript type definitions
