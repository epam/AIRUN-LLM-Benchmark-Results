# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all React imports use React 18.x compatible syntax  
  All React imports (e.g., the use of createRoot from "react-dom/client" in index.tsx) confirm compatibility with React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all components use functional component syntax with hooks instead of class components  
  Every component in the provided answer is implemented as a functional component using hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useCallback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Redux Toolkit's createSlice is used for state management  
  The todosSlice.ts file employs createSlice from Redux Toolkit, ensuring modern state management practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for all props, state, and Redux store  
  Well-defined TypeScript types and interfaces (found in types/index.ts) cover props for components, state shapes, and store definitions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses immutable state updates in reducers  
  The reducers in todosSlice leverage Redux Toolkit’s inbuilt Immer mechanism, which allows writing mutable code that is safely converted to immutable updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that nanoid is used for ID generation instead of custom UUID implementation  
  The todosSlice correctly imports and uses the nanoid function for generating unique IDs.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application uses React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate  
  Components such as TodoItem, TodoFooter, and TodoList are wrapped with React.memo to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that useCallback is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders  
  useCallback is consistently applied in components such as TodoItem and TodoInput for event handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage handling is implemented in a modern way  
  The storageUtils module handles localStorage operations with try/catch blocks, ensuring safe data retrieval and saving.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows consistent naming conventions throughout the application  
  All naming, including file names, function names, and constants, is consistent across the codebase.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper error handling is implemented where necessary  
  There is proper error handling in localStorage operations and a check in index.tsx for the existence of the root element, ensuring robustness.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware  
  The store, configured via Redux Toolkit’s configureStore, includes the default middleware suitable for the application’s complexity.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that React.lazy is used for code splitting where appropriate  
  The provided code does not utilize React.lazy for code splitting, missing an opportunity to optimize load performance by splitting code at the route or component level.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the codebase has no TODOs remaining  
  The answer explicitly indicates the removal of TODOs, and no inline TODO comments are present in the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux Provider wraps the application entry point  
  The index.tsx file correctly wraps the App component with the Redux Provider, passing the configured store.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure strict TypeScript type checking is implemented throughout the application  
  All components and Redux elements are typed with explicit TypeScript annotations, ensuring strict type checking across the codebase.
