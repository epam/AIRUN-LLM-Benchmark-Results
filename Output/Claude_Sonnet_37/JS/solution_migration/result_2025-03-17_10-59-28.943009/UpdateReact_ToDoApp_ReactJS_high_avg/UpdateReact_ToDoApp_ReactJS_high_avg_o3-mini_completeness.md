# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The TodoInput component listens for a keydown event; when the Enter key (KEYS.ENTER) is pressed, it dispatches the addTodo action after trimming the input value.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The TodoList component filters the todos based on the filter value (all, active, completed) and displays the appropriately filtered list.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  The TodoList component includes a checkbox that toggles all todos by dispatching the toggleAllTodos action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  The TodoItem component provides handlers for toggling (checkbox), editing (double-click on the label), and deleting (destroy button) each todo item.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  The TodoItem component attaches a double-click event handler on the label that dispatches the editTodo action to enable editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  When in editing mode, the TodoItem component listens for the Enter key (KEYS.ENTER) to trigger the handleSubmit function, which dispatches the saveTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  In the TodoItem component, pressing the Escape key (KEYS.ESCAPE) triggers a dispatch of cancelEdit and resets the edit text to the original todo title.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooter component calculates the count of active todos and displays it prominently within the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The TodoFooter component provides clickable links for each filter, dispatching setFilter with the corresponding filter value upon interaction.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  The TodoFooter component conditionally renders a "Clear completed" button when there is at least one completed todo and dispatches clearCompleted upon clicking.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  The storageUtils file implements getTodos and saveTodos, and these utilities are invoked in several reducers (e.g., addTodo, toggleTodo, deleteTodo, etc.) to persist todo state to localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  The TodoList and TodoApp components conditionally render their content based on the number of todos and current state (e.g., TodoApp renders TodoList and TodoFooter only if items exist).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  The TodoFooter component uses the storageUtils.pluralize function to correctly pluralize the word "item" depending on the count of active todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The application is composed of dedicated, well-organized components (TodoInput, TodoList, TodoItem, TodoFooter, etc.) focusing on individual functionalities.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The provided project structure shows clear separation of concerns with directories such as features, app, utils, constants, and types, indicating a well-organized file structure.
