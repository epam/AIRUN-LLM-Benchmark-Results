# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration
  
  The code begins with setting up a React application using Create React App with TypeScript template:
  ```bash
  npx create-react-app virtual-piano-react --template typescript
  ```
  
  The code also references React 18-specific features such as using `ReactDOM.createRoot` in the index.tsx file, which is the React 18 way of rendering applications.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure
  
  The code properly defines TypeScript interfaces in the types/index.ts file. Specifically for audio mapping, it defines:
  ```tsx
  export interface AudioMap {
    [key: string]: HTMLAudioElement;
  }
  ```
  This interface is then used in the useAudio hook.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks
  
  All components in the application (Header, Piano, PianoKey, ButtonContainer, FullscreenButton, Footer) are implemented as functional components using the `React.FC` type annotation, and they use React hooks like useState, useEffect, useCallback, and useRef.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)
  
  The application correctly uses React hooks for state management:
  - useState for managing active notes, show letters toggle, and fullscreen state
  - useEffect for keyboard event listeners, fullscreen change detection, and cleanup
  - useCallback for memoizing functions
  - useRef for maintaining references that don't trigger re-renders

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels
  
  Keyboard event handlers are implemented in the Piano component using useEffect to add and remove event listeners:
  ```tsx
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleKeyDown = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
      const note = keyToNoteMap.current[e.key.toLowerCase()];
      if (note) {
        playNote(note);
      }
    };

    const handleKeyUp = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
      const note = keyToNoteMap.current[e.key.toLowerCase()];
      if (note) {
        stopNote(note);
      }
    };

    window.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
    window.addEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp);

    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
      window.removeEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp);
    };
  }, [playNote, stopNote]);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events
  
  Mouse interactions are properly implemented as React synthetic events in the PianoKey component:
  ```tsx
  <div 
    className={className}
    data-letter={letter}
    data-note={noteName}
    onMouseDown={handleMouseDown}
    onMouseUp={handleMouseUp}
    onMouseOver={handleMouseOver}
  >
  ```
  The Piano component also includes a `onMouseLeave` handler on the piano container.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment
  
  Audio resources are handled using a custom `useAudio` hook that initializes, manages, and cleans up audio elements:
  ```tsx
  export const useAudio = (): AudioMap => {
    const audioMap = useRef<AudioMap>({});

    useEffect(() => {
      // Initialize audio elements
      const notes = ['c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'a', 'b', 'c♯', 'd♯', 'f♯', 'g♯', 'a♯'];
      
      notes.forEach(note => {
        audioMap.current[note] = new Audio(`${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/assets/audio/${note}.mp3`);
      });
      
      // Cleanup function
      return () => {
        Object.values(audioMap.current).forEach(audio => {
          audio.pause();
          audio.
