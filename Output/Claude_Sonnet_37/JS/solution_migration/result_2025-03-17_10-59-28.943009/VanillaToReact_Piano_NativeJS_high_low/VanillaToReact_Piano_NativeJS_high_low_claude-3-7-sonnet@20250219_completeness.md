# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'
  
  The code includes a Header component (`src/components/Header.tsx`) that renders a header with the title "Virtual Piano" and this component is included in the main App component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons
  
  The code includes a ButtonContainer component that renders two buttons labeled "Notes" and "Letters". The component receives props for the current state and a function to toggle between modes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)
  
  The Piano component correctly renders all necessary piano keys, including 7 white keys (natural notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B) and 5 black keys (sharp notes C♯, D♯, F♯, G♯, A♯), with one empty space in the black key row where E and F have no sharp between them.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes
  
  The PianoKey component sets the appropriate data attributes using `data-letter={letter}` and `data-note={noteName}` for each key.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked
  
  The code includes a custom hook (`useAudio`) that manages audio elements for each note, and the Piano component includes handlers for mouse events that play the appropriate audio when keys are clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)
  
  The code tracks active notes in the Piano component's state (`activeNotes`) and applies the `piano-key-active` class to keys that are currently active, which applies the highlight styling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes
  
  The Piano component includes keyboard event handlers that map keyboard keys to piano notes and trigger the appropriate audio playback when keys are pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked
  
  The App component maintains a state variable (`showLetters`) that is toggled by the ButtonContainer, and this state is passed to the Piano component to control what is displayed on each key.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes
  
  The code includes a FullscreenButton component that uses the `useFullscreen` hook to toggle between normal and fullscreen modes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly
  
  The Piano component tracks active notes in an array, allowing multiple notes to be active simultaneously. Each note is added to the array when activated and removed when deactivated.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys
  
  The Piano component includes mouse event handling logic that tracks when the mouse is pressed down (`isMouseDownRef`) and triggers note playback when the mouse moves over keys while pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information
  
  The code includes a Footer component that displays the current year, and this component is included in the main App component.
