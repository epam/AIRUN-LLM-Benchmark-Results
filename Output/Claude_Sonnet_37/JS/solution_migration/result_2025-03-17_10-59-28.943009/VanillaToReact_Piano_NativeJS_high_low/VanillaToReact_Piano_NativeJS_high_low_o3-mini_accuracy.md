# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration  
  The answer clearly uses the command "npx create-react-app virtual-piano-react --template typescript" and demonstrates ReactDOM.createRoot which confirms the usage of React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure  
  The code contains a TypeScript interface AudioMap in the types file, ensuring that the audio mapping is strictly typed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks  
  All components (Header, ButtonContainer, PianoKey, Piano, FullscreenButton, Footer) are implemented as React functional components using React hooks where needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)  
  The solution makes proper use of useState for managing UI state (e.g., active notes, showLetters) and useEffect for handling side effects (e.g., keyboard events, audio initialization, fullscreen change).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels  
  The Piano component attaches keyboard event listeners (keydown and keyup) at the window level within a useEffect, ensuring key events are handled appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events  
  Mouse events like onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseOver, and onMouseLeave are used via React’s synthetic event system, fulfilling requirements for mouse interaction handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment  
  The custom hook useAudio initializes audio elements with proper cleanup on unmount, ensuring that audio playback and termination are managed within the React lifecycle.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility  
  The FullscreenButton component uses a custom hook (useFullscreen) with modern document.fullscreen APIs and event listeners. While it handles the basic functionality and error catching, it does not include vendor-prefixed methods (e.g., webkitRequestFullscreen) which might be necessary for older browser versions. Thus, it passes with a slight reservation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns  
  Conditional classes are applied using JavaScript template literals (e.g., in PianoKey), which is a standard React pattern for dynamic styling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate  
  The code wraps multiple components with React.memo, ensuring that re-rendering is optimized when props do not change.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations  
  Audio playback is managed with care via the useAudio hook, which resets the audio elements and cleans up on component unmount, adhering to React’s lifecycle best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application  
  The entire codebase leverages TypeScript, using explicit interfaces and types for components, props, and custom hooks, ensuring type safety throughout the application.
