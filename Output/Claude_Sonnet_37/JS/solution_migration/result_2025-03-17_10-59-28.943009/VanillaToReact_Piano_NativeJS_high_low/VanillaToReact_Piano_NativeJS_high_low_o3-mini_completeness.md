# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title "Virtual Piano".  
  The Header component clearly renders an <h1> element with the title "Virtual Piano".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with "Notes" and "Letters" toggle buttons.  
  The ButtonContainer component renders two buttons labeled "Notes" and "Letters" and controls the toggling state accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys).  
  The Piano component maps through arrays of white keys and black keys (including a placeholder for spacing) to render all desired keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes.  
  The PianoKey component assigns data-letter and data-note attributes correctly based on the provided note object.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked.  
  The useAudio hook initializes audio elements for each note and the Piano component uses playNote to trigger the corresponding audio based on the note identifier.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed).  
  Active notes are tracked via the activeNotes state, and each PianoKey component receives an isActive prop to apply the "piano-key-active" CSS class.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes.  
  The Piano component sets up event listeners for keydown and keyup events that map keyboard keys to the corresponding piano notes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked.  
  The App component maintains a showLetters state that is passed to both ButtonContainer and Piano components, and clicking the buttons correctly updates the display mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes.  
  The FullscreenButton utilizes the useFullscreen hook which correctly requests and exits fullscreen mode based on the current state.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly.  
  The code supports multiple active notes using an array state (activeNotes). Although the implementation seems correct, testing multiple simultaneous key presses in a real-world scenario is necessary to be 100% certain.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys.  
  Mouse down, mouse over, and mouse up events are implemented using callbacks and a ref (isMouseDownRef), ensuring that dragging across keys will trigger playNote accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information.  
  The Footer component correctly displays the current year.
