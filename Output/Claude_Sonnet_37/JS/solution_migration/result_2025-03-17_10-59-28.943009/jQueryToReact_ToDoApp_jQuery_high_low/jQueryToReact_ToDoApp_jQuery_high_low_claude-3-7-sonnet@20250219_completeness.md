- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos
  
  The TodoList.tsx component properly implements a section with className "main" containing a toggle-all checkbox input and label, plus an unordered list with className "todo-list" to display the todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The application implements filtering through the Redux store with a 'filter' state property that can be set to 'all', 'active', or 'completed'. The TodoList component filters todos accordingly before rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter
  
  The Footer.tsx component includes an unordered list with filter links for All, Active, and Completed. The links include logic to add the "selected" class to the currently active filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management
  
  The TodoItem.tsx component includes edit functionality with a useRef for the input element and a useEffect that focuses the input when entering edit mode. The component also handles key events (Enter, Escape) and blur events properly.
