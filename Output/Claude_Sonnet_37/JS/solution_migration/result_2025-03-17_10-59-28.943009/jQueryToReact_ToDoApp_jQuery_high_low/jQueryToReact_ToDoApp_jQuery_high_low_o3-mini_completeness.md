- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos.  
  The Header component contains an <h1> element displaying "todos" and an input field with the placeholder "What needs to be done?".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos.  
  The TodoList component renders a section with class "main" that includes a toggle-all checkbox along with a list (<ul>) of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button.  
  Each TodoItem component contains an input of type checkbox for toggling, a label displaying the todo title, and a button with the "destroy" class for deletion.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode.  
  In the TodoItem component, the label has an onDoubleClick event handler that triggers editing mode by setting the componentâ€™s "editing" state to true.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed).  
  The Footer component presents three filter links ("All", "Active", "Completed") and changes the todo filter based on user selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization.  
  The Footer component computes the count of active todos and uses the "pluralize" utility to correctly display "item" or "items" depending on the count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter.  
  The Footer component applies a "selected" class to the currently active filter link based on the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist.  
  The Footer renders a "Clear completed" button conditionally when there is at least one completed todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter.  
  In the Header component, when the user types in the input and presses the Enter key, a new todo is created via the addTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos.  
  The TodoItem component dispatches the toggleTodo action when the checkbox is changed, correctly toggling its completion state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once.  
  The TodoList component includes a toggle-all checkbox that dispatches the toggleAllTodos action, updating the completion status for all todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management.  
  The TodoItem component handles editing mode and uses a ref with useEffect to focus the input field, ensuring a smooth editing experience.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos.  
  A delete button (with class "destroy") is provided in each TodoItem, which dispatches the deleteTodo action upon being clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos.  
  The Footer component provides a "Clear completed" button that dispatches the clearCompleted action when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status.
