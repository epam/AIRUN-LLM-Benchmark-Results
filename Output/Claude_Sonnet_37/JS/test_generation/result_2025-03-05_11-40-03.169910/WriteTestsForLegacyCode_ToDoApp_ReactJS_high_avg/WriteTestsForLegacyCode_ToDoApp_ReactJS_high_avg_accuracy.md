# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Check that the tests are isolated and do not depend on each other.
- **Pass**: Each test is self-contained and does not rely on the state or outcome of other tests. The use of `beforeEach` ensures a clean state for each test.

### Step 2: Validate that the tests adhere to best practices for unit testing.
- **Pass**: The tests follow best practices, including clear descriptions, single assertions per test where possible, and the use of mocks and spies to isolate the unit under test.

### Step 3: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
- **Pass**: The code does not contain unnecessary duplicates. Common setup logic is placed in `beforeEach` blocks, and utility functions are mocked appropriately.

### Step 4: Verify the test framework and libraries are chosen and listed appropriately.
- **Pass**: The test framework (Jest) and libraries (e.g., `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`) are appropriate for the React and TypeScript environment and are listed correctly in `package.json`.

### Step 5: Confirm the testing environment setup is included.
- **Pass**: The testing environment setup is included, with configuration files such as `jest.config.js` and `setupTests.ts`.

### Step 6: Ensure the testing environment configuration file is present.
- **Pass**: The `jest.config.js` file is present and correctly configured for the project.

### Step 7: Validate the setup for the test environment is included.
- **Pass**: The setup for the test environment is included in `setupTests.ts`, which imports `@testing-library/jest-dom`.

### Step 8: Ensure the tests cover at least 80% of the codebase.
- **Pass**: The `jest.config.js` file includes a `coverageThreshold` configuration that ensures at least 80% coverage for branches, functions, lines, and statements.

### Step 9: Confirm that mocking is used for dependencies where necessary.
- **Pass**: Mocking is used appropriately for dependencies, such as in `todoModel.test.ts` and `footer.test.tsx`, ensuring that tests are isolated and focused on the unit under test.

### Step 10: Verify that the generated code does not contain any TODOs.
- **Pass**: The code does not contain any TODO comments, indicating that all planned functionality is implemented and tested.
