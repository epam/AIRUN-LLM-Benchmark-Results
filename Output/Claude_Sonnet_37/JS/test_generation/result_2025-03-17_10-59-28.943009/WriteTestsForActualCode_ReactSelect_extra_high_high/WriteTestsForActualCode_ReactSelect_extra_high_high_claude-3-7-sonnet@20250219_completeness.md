# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present
- **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented
- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested
- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states
- **Pass** (90%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance

    The test suite includes a test with 20 options to check pagination functionality, but there aren't explicit performance tests for very large option sets (hundreds or thousands of options). However, the pagination test does address the fundamental interaction pattern for navigating large sets.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations
- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)
- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)
