# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist  
  The test suite includes a "Basic Rendering" section with tests checking default rendering, custom placeholders, disabled states, and initial values.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present  
  The "Keyboard Navigation" section covers arrow keys, Enter, Escape, Tab, Home/End, as well as PageUp/PageDown events.

- **Fail** (90%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)  
  While several tests cover mouse interactions such as clicking options, clear buttons, and remove buttons, there is no explicit test examining mouse hover behaviors.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior  
  The suite tests controlled components (with explicit value and onChange callbacks) and default rendering is demonstrated; however, explicit tests contrasting controlled versus uncontrolled usage are minimal. This gives moderate confidence in coverage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values  
  There are tests for clicking options, multi-select modifications, backspace removals, clear button actions, and removal via multi-value remove buttons.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented  
  The suite includes tests for opening the menu via click and keyboard events, and closing using the Escape key and onMenuClose callbacks.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality  
  Several tests cover input change, filtering results, custom filter functions, and behavior when searching is disabled.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist  
  There are multiple tests demonstrating multi-select rendering, selection, removal, and backspace behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility  
  The "Accessibility" section specifically validates ARIA attributes such as aria-expanded, aria-controls, aria-activedescendant, aria-label, and aria-labelledby.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested  
  The edge case of an empty options array is directly tested and expected to render a "No options" message.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states  
  Although there are tests for loading states (e.g., displaying a loading message and custom loading messages), there are no tests covering error states.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states  
  Tests specifically check for rendering in disabled state and handling options marked as disabled and via a custom isOptionDisabled function.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance  
  A pagination-like test using 20 options and PageUp/PageDown keys is provided. While the behavior is validated, there is no explicit performance stress test.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested  
  The suite verifies focus state changes on user focus and blur events and keys navigation to maintain proper focused styles.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering  
  The tests cover custom placeholder texts and value rendering for both single and multi-select modes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations  
  There is a dedicated test that checks the rendering output when a custom formatOptionLabel function is used.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)  
  Multiple tests validate that callback functions are triggered with the appropriate arguments throughout various user interactions.

- **Fail** (90%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)  
  While tests for clear and loading indicators exist, there is no explicit coverage for the dropdown indicator component. This results in a failure for full indicator component testing.
