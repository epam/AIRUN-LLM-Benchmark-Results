# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)
  
  The answer clearly uses Jasmine as the testing framework along with Karma as the test runner, which are both appropriate choices for AngularJS applications. This is evident from the configuration in karma.conf.js which specifies `frameworks: ['jasmine']` and the use of Jasmine's syntax patterns throughout (describe, it, beforeEach, etc.).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints
  
  The tests properly mock the $resource service through the use of `$httpBackend` for testing REST API endpoints. For example, in the REST Factory tests, there are explicit expectations for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests with proper response mocking.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation
  
  Throughout the test suite, `beforeEach` hooks are used to set up the testing environment, reset factories to default states, and inject dependencies. `afterEach` hooks are also used, particularly for verifying no outstanding HTTP requests remain (e.g., `$httpBackend.verifyNoOutstandingExpectation()`).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls
  
  All HTTP requests are properly mocked using `$httpBackend.expect*` methods or `whenGET/POST/PUT/DELETE` in the integration tests. The tests also ensure verification that no unexpected requests are made with `verifyNoOutstandingExpectation()` and `verifyNoOutstandingRequest()`.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection
  
  The tests correctly use AngularJS's dependency injection pattern with the `inject` function to obtain references to services. For example: `beforeEach(inject(function(_REST_, _$httpBackend_) {...}))` and properly unwrap the dependencies.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations
  
  Promises and asynchronous operations are properly handled throughout the tests. The code uses `$httpBackend.flush()` to resolve pending requests, and tests properly chain promise callbacks to assert results after asynchronous operations complete.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies
  
  The tests make appropriate use of Jasmine's spying capabilities with `spyOn()` for mocking external dependencies such as `localStorage`, `$location`, `$rootScope.$broadcast`, and service methods. The spies are configured with appropriate return values or fake implementations as needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization
  
  The tests follow a clear hierarchical structure using nested `describe` blocks for grouping related tests and `it` blocks for individual test cases. This provides good organization and readability of the test suite.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls
  
  The tests cover both success scenarios (e.g., successful page creation/update) and error handling (e.g., validation failures before saving). For example, in the pageCtrl tests, there are specific tests for validation errors like missing URL or page type.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate
  
  The tests appropriately simulate user interactions by calling controller methods that would be triggered by user actions, such as `titleChange()`, `urlChange()`, `savePage()`, `deletePage()`, etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage
  
  The tests properly clean up after execution through the use of `afterEach` hooks that verify no outstanding HTTP expectations or requests, and by resetting factory states in `beforeEach` blocks to ensure test isolation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested
  
  The test names are clear and descriptive, following good practices like "should initialize page properties from Page factory" or "should update page type and broadcast settings update", making it easy to understand what's being tested.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible
  
  While many tests appropriately focus on outputs, there are several instances where tests
