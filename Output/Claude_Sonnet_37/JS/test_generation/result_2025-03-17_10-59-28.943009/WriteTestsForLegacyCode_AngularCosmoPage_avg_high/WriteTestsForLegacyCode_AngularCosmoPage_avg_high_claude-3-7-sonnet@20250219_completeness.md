- **Pass** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources
  
  The provided tests for the REST factory include tests for various API endpoints such as blocks, content, contentExtras, contentRevisions, etc. The test suite verifies that all required API endpoints are defined and covers standard REST operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for these resources.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly
  
  The tests for the Page factory explicitly verify that all properties (id, title, description, header, subheader, body, url, type, published, published_date, themePages, timestamp, extras, misc) are initialized with the correct default values.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly
  
  The tests for the Users factory verify that all properties (id, username, name, bio, email, facebook, twitter, photo, role) are initialized with the correct default values.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods
  
  The tests for the pageCtrl controller cover all public methods including titleChange, descriptionChange, urlChange, localVersion, deleteNewerVersion, saveLocal, autocompleteTags, selectSuggestion, updatePageType, deletePage, and savePage.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller
  
  The tests verify page initialization logic, including setting default page type, initializing scheduleDate for new pages, and checking for unsaved versions from localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation
  
  The tests for the titleChange function verify that URLs are auto-generated from the title for new pages and that the URL is not auto-generated when autoURL is set to false.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction
  
  The tests for the saveLocal function verify that local changes are properly saved to localStorage by checking that localStorage.setItem is called with the correct parameters.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality
  
  The tests for the autocompleteTags function verify that tag suggestions are retrieved and processed correctly, including handling empty tag suggestions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)
  
  The tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches including validation of required fields, preventing duplicate URLs when duplicating, creating a new page, and updating an existing page.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types
  
  The tests validate edge cases such as empty URLs and page types, ensuring appropriate error messages are displayed and that the save operation is prevented in these cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly
  
  The tests verify that the deletePage function correctly deletes the page and related data, including revisions, extras, and tags.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions
  
  The tests verify the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions, including restoring local versions and deleting newer versions.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components
  
  The tests appear comprehensive and cover the critical paths and edge cases for all components. While a specific coverage percentage isn't explicitly stated, the depth and breadth of the tests suggest they would achieve at least 80% coverage. The configuration includes coverage reporting setup, which indicates a focus on measuring and maintaining high coverage.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling
  
  The tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling, including setting up spies on $rootScope.$broadcast and verifying that the correct events are broadcast with the expected parameters.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality
  
  The tests validate date handling and scheduling functionality, verifying that scheduled publishing works as expected with both future and past dates.
