# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources  
  The provided code includes a complete test file (tests/factories/rest.factory.spec.js) that verifies the existence of all required API endpoints (e.g., 'blocks', 'blocksRequirements', 'comments', etc.) within the REST factory.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly  
  The tests inside tests/factories/page.factory.spec.js check that all properties such as id, title, description, header, subheader, body, url, type, themePages, extras, and misc are properly initialized.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly  
  The tests in tests/factories/users.factory.spec.js properly validate each property (id, username, name, bio, email, facebook, twitter, photo, role) against expected default values.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods  
  The tests for the pageCtrl controller cover a wide variety of functions including initialization, titleChange, descriptionChange, URL change behavior, local version management, tag handling, page type updates, deletion, saving (new, duplicate, update), and event broadcasting.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller  
  Tests under the "Initialization" describe block confirm that page properties are properly set from the Page factory and check for unsaved versions via localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation  
  The tests for titleChange explicitly verify that when a new title is set, the URL is auto-generated correctly (e.g., converting 'This is a Test Page!' to 'this-is-a-test-page').

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction  
  The local version management tests check that localStorage items are retrieved, updated, and deleted correctly when saving or restoring page data.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality  
  The tests for autocompleteTags in the controller check that tag suggestions are correctly fetched and updated according to the current input, as well as handling an empty tags array.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)  
  The tests for savePage address various scenarios including creation of a new page, detection of duplicate URLs when duplicating, and updating an existing page. They also simulate server responses and check for proper REST service calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types  
  The tests specifically validate that missing mandatory fields (e.g., empty URL or missing page type) trigger the correct error notifications, ensuring edge cases are handled.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly  
  There is a dedicated test block for deleting a page that confirms proper REST.delete calls are made for content and related endpoints, with corresponding UI notifications.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions  
  The suite includes tests that check restoring local versions from localStorage, deleting locally saved versions, and saving local changes to ensure the versioning logic is functioning as expected.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components  
  The extensive tests across the REST factory, factories (Page and Users), the controller, and the integration tests suggest a comprehensive coverage. However, without running a coverage tool, the exact percentage canâ€™t be confirmed, hence the slight reduction in confidence.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling  
  The tests check for proper handling of events such as 'contentGet' and verify that notifications are broadcast correctly during operations like saving and deleting pages.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality  
  The tests for savePage explicitly check the behavior for scheduled publishing by comparing future and past dates to determine the 'published' status.
