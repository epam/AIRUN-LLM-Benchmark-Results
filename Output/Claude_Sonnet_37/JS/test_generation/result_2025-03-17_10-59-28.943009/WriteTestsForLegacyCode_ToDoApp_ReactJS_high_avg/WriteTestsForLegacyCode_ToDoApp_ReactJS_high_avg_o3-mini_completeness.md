# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering  
  The test file for app.tsx contains tests such as "should render correctly with todos" and "should initialize with correct state".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos  
  The test "should add a new todo when Enter key is pressed" confirms the functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos  
  The test "should toggle all todos when toggle-all checkbox is clicked" is present and confirms this functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos  
  The test "should filter todos based on nowShowing state" demonstrates filtering functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The test "should clear completed todos when clear completed button is clicked" is implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering  
  Tests covering rendering in non-editing, editing, and completed modes are included.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos  
  Tests such as "should call onToggle when checkbox is clicked", "should call onDestroy when destroy button is clicked", and "should call onEdit when label is double-clicked" confirm these capabilities.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events  
  The tests handle both ENTER and ESCAPE key events.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts  
  Tests for rendering with one active item and multiple active items are present.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation  
  The tests check that the All, Active, and Completed filters are correctly highlighted.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The test "should call onClearCompleted when clear completed button is clicked" verifies this functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos  
  Tests for addTodo, toggle, save, and destroy functionalities are all covered.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions  
  Both functions are directly tested in the subscribe and inform unit tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The "should remove all completed todos" test verifies the clearCompleted functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation  
  The tests check for valid UUID format and uniqueness.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality  
  The tests confirm both singular and plural outputs based on count.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations  
  There are tests checking storing, retrieving, and handling empty localStorage values.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function  
  The tests for extend confirm that objects are merged correctly.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx  
  Most React component test files (e.g., app, todoItem, footer, constants) use the .test.tsx convention. However, utility and model tests are named as .test.ts rather than .test.tsx. This deviation might be acceptable since plain TypeScript files without JSX typically use .test.ts. Still, given the evaluation step explicitly mentions [filename].test.tsx, this small inconsistency is noted.  
  (I am 90% confident because many projects use .test.ts for non-JSX tests, but the instruction expected .test.tsx universally.)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data  
  Sample todo objects are provided in multiple test files as fixtures.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented  
  The app.test.tsx includes mocks for Router and tests to confirm that routing is set up correctly.
