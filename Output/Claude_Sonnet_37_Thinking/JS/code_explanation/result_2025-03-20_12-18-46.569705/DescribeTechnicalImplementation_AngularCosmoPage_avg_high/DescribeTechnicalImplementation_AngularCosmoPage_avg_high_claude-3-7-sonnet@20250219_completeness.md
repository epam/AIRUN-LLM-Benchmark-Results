# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation includes a comprehensive component overview explaining the purpose and architecture
  
  The documentation begins with a clear component overview in section 1, explaining that the Cosmo CMS Page Management component is an AngularJS-based system for managing web content pages. It outlines the purpose (creating, editing, and managing web content) and architecture (follows MVC with additional factory services for state management and API communication).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all major components (REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and Page controller) are documented
  
  All major components are well documented in section 2. The documentation clearly describes the REST Factory (section 2.1), Page Factory (section 2.1), Users Factory (section 2.1), and Page Controller (section 2.2), including their purposes, structures, and key properties.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure all significant features of the page management system are described
  
  The documentation thoroughly covers significant features in section 3, including Page Editing (3.1), Version Management (3.2), Publishing Workflow (3.3), Tag Management (3.4), and Extended Metadata (3.5), with each feature having detailed explanations and code examples.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all form inputs and their behavior are documented
  
  The documentation details form input behavior in section 3.1, explaining two-way data binding, real-time validation, character counting, URL generation, and draft auto-saving. There's also a complete listing of form-related controller methods in section 4.1, showing how each input's changes are handled.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page versioning and revision system
  
  Section 3.2 specifically addresses Version Management, clearly explaining both browser-based draft recovery and server-side revision history. The documentation provides details on how unsaved changes are stored in localStorage and how full page revisions are saved to the database.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation covers the tag system and autocomplete functionality
  
  Section 3.4 comprehensively describes the Tag Management system, including intelligent autocompletion, how tags are added as comma-separated values, tag suggestions, real-time API queries, and one-click selection. Code examples demonstrate implementation of the autocompleteTags() method.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure the documentation includes explanation of error handling and user notifications
  
  While the documentation briefly mentions "Error messaging for validation issues" in section 6 on Accessibility Considerations, it lacks a dedicated section or detailed explanation on error handling strategies and user notification mechanisms. The documentation doesn't cover how API errors are handled, what types of user notifications exist (e.g., success messages, validation errors, server errors), or how these notifications are displayed to users.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page publishing workflow including scheduling
  
  Section 3.3 specifically addresses the Publishing Workflow, clearly describing the three publishing states (Published, Draft, Scheduled), and providing implementation details about the date/time picker, server-side timestamp handling, and support for backdating content. Code examples demonstrate the implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation details how content extras and additional metadata are managed
  
  Section 3.5 thoroughly explains the Extended Metadata ("Extras") system, describing how custom fields are stored as key-value pairs, JSON serialization for complex data types, revisioning of extras alongside main content, and the separate API endpoints for extras management. Code examples show how extras are saved.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation explains how the UI interacts with the backend APIs
  
  The documentation clearly explains API interactions throughout, with a dedicated section 4.2 detailing REST API endpoints. It shows how the UI components interact with these endpoints via the REST factory. Code examples demonstrate API usage patterns, and section 2.1 provides a comprehensive table of all resources and endpoints.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes sample usage examples or patterns
  
  Section 5 is dedicated to Usage Examples, with specific subsections showing how to create a new page (5.1) and edit an existing page (5.2). Both examples contain code snippets demonstrating implementation patterns.

- **Fail** (95%): Verify the documentation explains all significant event broadcasting and inter-component communication
  
  While the documentation explains the Page factory as a state container for sharing data across components, it doesn't specifically address event broadcasting mechanisms
