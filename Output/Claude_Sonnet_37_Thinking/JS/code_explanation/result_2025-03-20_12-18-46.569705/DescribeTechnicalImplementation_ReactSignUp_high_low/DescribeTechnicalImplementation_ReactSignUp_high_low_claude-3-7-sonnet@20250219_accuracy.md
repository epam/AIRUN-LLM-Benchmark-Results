- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that accessibility features are accurately documented with correct ARIA roles and attributes

    While the documentation describes accessibility features comprehensively, it doesn't explicitly list all specific ARIA roles and attributes that might be implemented. It mentions that Bootstrap's form controls provide built-in accessibility and references help-block classes for associating error messages with form fields, but doesn't detail exact ARIA attributes like aria-invalid, aria-describedby, etc. This level of detail would further strengthen the accessibility documentation. However, the general accessibility features are well documented.
