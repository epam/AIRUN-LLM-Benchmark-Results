# Evaluation Report

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.**
   - **Pass**: All imports (`React`, `useEffect`, `useState`, `axios`) are used in the code.

2. **Ensure the codebase is structured and follows React best practices (state, hooks, effects).**
   - **Pass**: The code is well-structured, using `useState` for state management and `useEffect` for side effects.

3. **Check that a debounced function is used to optimize the search requests.**
   - **Pass**: The `useDebounce` hook is implemented and used to debounce the search term.

4. **Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.**
   - **Pass**: The `useEffect` cleanup function clears the timeout, preventing memory leaks.

5. **Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.**
   - **Pass**: The code uses modern React hooks and TypeScript generics, ensuring compatibility with the latest versions.

6. **Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.**
   - **Pass**: The code does not contain any obvious issues that would cause console errors or warnings.

7. **Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.**
   - **Pass**: The input value is managed via React state (`searchTerm`), not directly accessed from the DOM.

8. **Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React virtual DOM.**
   - **Pass**: The code does not manipulate the DOM directly; it relies on React's virtual DOM.

9. **Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React state and props.**
   - **Pass**: The code does not use refs for DOM access; it uses state and props appropriately.

10. **Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.**
    - **Pass**: The code is concise and does not contain any duplicated logic.

11. **Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.**
    - **Pass**: The use of `useDebounce` helps to minimize unnecessary re-renders.

12. **Confirm that the useState is used to capture the search input value.**
    - **Pass**: `useState` is used to manage the `searchTerm` state.

13. **Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs.**
    - **Pass**: The code does not contain any TODO comments.

14. **Verify the inclusion of TypeScript in the React application.**
    - **Pass**: The code is written in TypeScript, as indicated by the use of interfaces and type annotations.

15. **Ensure that `axios` is used for making API requests.**
    - **Pass**: `axios` is used to fetch data from the API.

16. **Validate that the `useEffect` hooks are used correctly for data loading.**
    - **Pass**: `useEffect` is used correctly to fetch data when the debounced search term changes.
