# Evaluation Report

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Check that a loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.**
   - **Pass**: The code includes a `loading` state and conditionally renders a "Loading..." message when `loading` is `true`.

2. **Verify that the loader does not hide the search input when data is loading.**
   - **Pass**: The search input is always rendered, regardless of the `loading` state.

3. **Validate that a request with an empty search term is sent on the initial render.**
   - **Pass**: On initial render, `searchTerm` is an empty string, and the `useEffect` hook triggers a fetch with an empty search term.

4. **Verify that the search input field is present.**
   - **Pass**: The search input field is present and rendered in the component.

5. **Ensure that the character search functionality is implemented.**
   - **Pass**: The search functionality is implemented using the `useDebounce` hook and the `useEffect` hook to fetch data based on the debounced search term.

6. **Ensure that the API request includes the search term as a query parameter.**
   - **Pass**: The API request includes the search term as a query parameter (`params: { search: debouncedSearchTerm }`).

7. **Validate that the data is loading on initial app load with empty query and then when the search term changes.**
   - **Pass**: The data is fetched on initial load with an empty query and subsequently when the search term changes, as handled by the `useEffect` hook.

8. **Ensure that the debounced fetch function prevents unnecessary API requests.**
   - **Pass**: The `useDebounce` hook is correctly implemented to delay the API request, preventing unnecessary calls.

9. **Confirm that the character list is updated based on the search results.**
   - **Pass**: The character list is updated based on the search results and rendered in the component.

10. **Validate that the application handles API request errors.**
    - **Pass**: The application handles API request errors by catching them and logging the error, as well as setting the `characters` state to an empty array.

11. **Ensure that the user experience remains smooth without backend overloads.**
    - **Pass**: The use of debouncing ensures that the user experience remains smooth and prevents backend overloads by limiting the number of API requests.
