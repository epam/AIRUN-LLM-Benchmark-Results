The component implementation demonstrates all the required functionality:

1. The `SearchableSelect` component renders a dropdown UI with proper visual styling in the CSS.
2. There is a search input field that filters options as the user types (see `handleSearchChange` and the `filteredOptions` logic).
3. The component supports single selection as shown by the `onChange` handler and value tracking.
4. Keyboard navigation is fully implemented via the `handleKeyDown` function, which handles both ArrowUp and ArrowDown keys.
5. Selection via Enter key is handled in the `handleKeyDown` function when Enter is pressed and an item is highlighted.
6. The Enter key toggles the dropdown visibility when the component is focused (in the `handleKeyDown` function).
7. Focus management is implemented to return focus to the select component after closing (using `inputRef.current.focus()`).
8. The dropdown closes on item selection via mouse click (in the `handleSelect` function).
9. The dropdown closes on item selection via keyboard (in the `handleKeyDown` function's Enter key handler).
10. The Escape key closes the dropdown (in the `handleKeyDown` function's Escape key handler).
11. Clicking outside the component closes the dropdown (implemented via the useEffect with `handleClickOutside`).
12. The dropdown opens on Enter key press when focused (in the `handleKeyDown` function).
