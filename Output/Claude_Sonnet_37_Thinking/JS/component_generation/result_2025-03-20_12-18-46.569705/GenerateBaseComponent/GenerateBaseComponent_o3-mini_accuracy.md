# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  The component uses React function components and hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef), which are fully compatible with React 18. Although the code does not explicitly import from "react" version 18, the usage and context imply React 18 usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  The code is in a .tsx file and includes clear TypeScript interfaces (e.g., Option, SearchableSelectProps) along with type annotations for state and refs, ensuring proper type definitions throughout.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  An "index.css" file is provided and contains comprehensive styling rules for the component, confirming inclusion and integration of CSS styling.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  The component code is well-organized, free of any TODO comments, and presents a clear, production-ready implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  The component manages state effectively using useState for values such as isOpen, searchTerm, and highlightedIndex, handling dropdown visibility and selection accurately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  The component accepts configurable props including options, value, onChange, placeholder, disabled, and className, ensuring its reusability in different contexts.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  Keyboard event handling (Enter, Escape, ArrowDown, ArrowUp) is correctly implemented to manage dropdown opening, selection, and navigation, adhering to accessibility best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  Multiple refs (selectRef, inputRef, dropdownRef) are used appropriately to interact with the DOM, and event listeners (e.g., click outside) are managed correctly with useEffect cleanup.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  Focus is well managed by moving it to the input element when necessary (after dropdown closure or selection), providing a smooth user experience.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  ARIA attributes including role="combobox", aria-expanded, aria-haspopup, aria-owns, and others are integrated to ensure that screen readers and assistive technologies correctly interpret the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  Based on a thorough review of the code, no obvious patterns or anti-patterns are present that would cause console errors or warnings in a typical environment.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  The component is structured using hooks and optimized event handling. There are no clear signs of performance issues or unnecessary re-renders, and best practices appear to be followed.
