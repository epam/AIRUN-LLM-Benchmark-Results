# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component returns a div with the class "searchable-select" and conditionally renders the dropdown options when isOpen is true, indicating a proper dropdown UI element.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  The component contains an input element that acts as a search field. It is rendered inside the select control and allows filtering of options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The component supports single selection via the onChange callback, and only one value is tracked at a time.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  ArrowUp and ArrowDown key events are handled in the onKeyDown handler to adjust the highlighted index in the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  When the dropdown is open, pressing the Enter key triggers selection if an option is highlighted, which is implemented in the handleKeyDown function.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  The Enter key functionality toggles the dropdown's isOpen state, either opening or closing it based on the current state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  Both in handleSelect and when the Escape key is pressed, the code explicitly resets focus to the input element, confirming proper focus management.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  The onClick event on each option calls handleSelect, which sets isOpen to false, closing the dropdown upon mouse click.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  When an option is selected using the Enter key during keyboard navigation, handleSelect is invoked, closing the dropdown as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  The handleKeyDown function includes a case for the Escape key that closes the dropdown and returns focus to the select input.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  A useEffect hook is used to add a mousedown event listener that checks if the click occurred outside the component, ensuring the dropdown is closed appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  When the component is focused and the dropdown is closed, pressing Enter calls toggleDropdown, which sets isOpen to true, correctly opening the dropdown.
