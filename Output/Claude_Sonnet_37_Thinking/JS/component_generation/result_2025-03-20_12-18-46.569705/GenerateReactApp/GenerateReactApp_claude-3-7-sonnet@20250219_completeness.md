# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The application correctly fetches Star Wars characters from the SWAPI API (`https://swapi.dev/api/people`) and renders them in a list. The `CharacterList` component uses Axios to make the API request and stores the results in the `characters` state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  A loading spinner is implemented and displayed while the API request is in progress. The `loading` state controls when this is shown, and the implementation includes both a spinner animation and a "Loading characters..." text message.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The application maps through all the characters returned from the API and displays each one using the `CharacterItem` component. The mapping function doesn't filter or limit the results.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  The code does not contain any search input fields, filters, or user input controls. It's a simple viewer application without search functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character is rendered using the `CharacterItem` component which displays the character's name property from the data.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The package.json file and project structure clearly indicate this is a Create React App project. The dependencies, scripts, and configurations are typical of a CRA application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The application correctly implements useState hooks for managing the three states:
  - `characters`: Stores the list of characters
  - `loading`: Tracks when data is being fetched
  - `error`: Captures any error messages

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each `CharacterItem` is rendered with a unique key using the character's URL property: `<CharacterItem key={character.url} character={character} />`, which provides a reliable unique identifier.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  The application handles various states properly:
  - When loading, it shows a loading spinner
  - When there's an error, it displays an error message
  - If the API returns empty results, the list would simply be empty (though this is implicit since the application doesn't explicitly check for an empty array)
