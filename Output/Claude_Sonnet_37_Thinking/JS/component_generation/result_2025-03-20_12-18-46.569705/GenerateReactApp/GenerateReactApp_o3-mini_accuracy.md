# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses React 18.x or newer by checking the package.json dependencies  
  The package.json lists "react": "^18.2.0", which meets the requirement for React 18.x or newer.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that TypeScript is properly implemented with appropriate type definitions for all components, props, and states  
  All components use TypeScript with proper interfaces (e.g., Character, SwapiResponse) and appropriate typings for props and state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Axios is used for API requests to fetch data from the Star Wars API endpoint  
  The use of Axios is evident in the CharacterList component where the API request is made to fetch data from the SWAPI.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles API errors gracefully with appropriate error states or messages  
  Error handling is implemented inside the try-catch block in the fetchCharacters function, setting an error message that is subsequently rendered to the user.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the character data is fetched on component mount using useEffect hook  
  The useEffect hook is correctly used to fetch the character data upon component mount.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application properly manages component rendering optimization  
  The CharacterItem component is wrapped with React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders, showing a clear effort to optimize rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows React best practices using hooks appropriately  
  Hooks like useState, useEffect, and React.memo are used correctly throughout the application, adhering to modern React conventions.

  The code is clean and free of extraneous comments and TODOs, keeping the implementation focused.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the codebase has minimal comments that only clarify complex logic when necessary  
  Comments are minimal and only present where they add clarity, which aligns with best practices in code documentation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the API endpoint 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' is being called correctly  
  The API endpoint is correctly referenced in the Axios GET request, ensuring that data is fetched from the intended SWAPI endpoint.
