# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The application fetches data from "https://swapi.dev/api/people" in the CharacterList component and maps the "results" array to render a list of characters. All fetched characters are intended to be displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  While the data is being fetched, the component renders a loading container that includes a spinner and the text "Loading characters…". This satisfies the requirement for a visual indicator during API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  Once the API call is successful, the results are stored in the state variable "characters", and the UI maps over this array to display each character in a list item.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  The provided code does not implement any search functionality or include user input fields. It simply fetches and displays characters, which matches the evaluation requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  The CharacterItem component, which is memoized for performance, renders each character's name inside an <li> element. The character name is clearly presented in the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The package.json confirms the use of "react-scripts" and the project structure (e.g., the src directory with index.tsx and App.tsx) is consistent with a Create React App project.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The component manages the "loading", "error", and "characters" states using React's useState hook. It appropriately updates these states based on the API call result.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  Each character list item uses the "character.url" as the key, ensuring that each item in the list has a unique and stable key for optimal rendering in React.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  If the API returns an empty list of characters, the code will render an empty <ul> element. Although there’s no explicit "no data" message, the handling is implicit through the rendering of an empty list. Some might prefer an explicit message for an empty state, but based on the given requirements, the current handling is acceptable. Confidence is slightly lower (90%) because explicit empty state messaging could further enhance user experience.
