# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name

  The code includes a search input field in the `CharacterList` component that updates the `searchQuery` state and triggers API requests to filter characters by name. The input is properly implemented with appropriate attributes including placeholder, value binding, onChange handler, and accessibility attributes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests

  The application displays a loading indicator during API requests. There's a dedicated loading state (`loading`) that's set to true before API calls and false after they complete. When loading is true, the code renders a loading spinner with a "Loading characters..." message inside a properly styled container.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query

  Initial data loading is implemented correctly. The `useEffect` hook correctly triggers `fetchCharacters()` when the component mounts and whenever the debounced search query changes. The initial call happens with an empty search query, which will fetch all characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type

  The implementation includes a debounced search mechanism that updates results as users type. The `useDebounce` custom hook ensures that API calls are only made after the user stops typing for 500ms, preventing excessive API requests while still providing dynamic updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found

  The code displays appropriate feedback when no results are found, showing a message: "No characters found matching '[search query]'" when the API returns an empty results array. This provides clear feedback to users when their search criteria don't match any characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design

  The search component has responsive design elements. The CSS includes responsive styling with `max-width` settings and relative units. The search input is set to `width: 100%; max-width: 400px;` which ensures it works well across different screen sizes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response

  The character list correctly displays search results after receiving the API response. When the API call completes, the `characters` state is updated with `response.data.results`, and these results are then mapped to list items in the rendered output.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed

  The implementation includes a proper error boundary with the `ErrorBoundary` class component that catches rendering errors. It's correctly implemented with `getDerivedStateFromError` and displays a user-friendly error message when errors occur. Additionally, there's separate error handling for API request failures.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props

  The code properly defines TypeScript interfaces for all data structures and component props. This includes the `Character` interface for API data, proper typing of state variables (using generics where appropriate like in the debounce hook), proper typing of event handlers, and complete type definitions for the error boundary component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities

  The implementation adds search capabilities while maintaining all the original functionality. The character list still displays properly, loading states are handled correctly, error handling remains intact, and the overall component structure remains organized and maintainable.
