# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type  
  The input element’s value is tied to the state variable "searchQuery" and the "onChange" handler updates it using setSearchQuery.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls  
  The custom hook "useDebounce" is implemented with a delay of 500ms, which falls within the acceptable range (300-500ms) for debouncing API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured  
  The code uses axios.get to make API calls, and the URL is constructed correctly. The configuration looks standard for axios usage.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses  
  The code uses TypeScript interfaces (e.g., "Character") and types (e.g., React.FC). While most parts are well typed, the axios response is not explicitly declared with a generic type, which might be improved. This is a minor point, hence the confidence is 90%.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters  
  The API endpoint “https://swapi.dev/api/people/?search=${query}” is correctly constructed to include the search parameters.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate  
  The function "fetchCharacters" is wrapped with useCallback to prevent unnecessary recreations, which is in line with performance optimization best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback  
  Error handling is implemented using a try-catch block, setting an error message in the state, and displaying it in the UI for user feedback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing  
  The debouncing pattern (500ms delay) ensures that API calls are only triggered after the user stops typing, as the effect depends on the debounced value.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices  
  The state for search queries, loading, error, and character results are all maintained via useState hooks, and effects are used appropriately. This follows recommended React best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code  
  There are no extraneous commented-out code sections, and all imports (React, axios) are necessary. The code appears clean and error-free.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests  
  The loading state is set to true at the start of the API call and updated in the finally block after the call completes, correctly reflecting the loading status.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns  
  The implementation uses React.FC, hooks like useState, useEffect, and useCallback, which are all consistent with current React (18.x) practices. The use of a class component for the Error Boundary is still acceptable in React 18.
