# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The implementation includes an input element with a placeholder "Search characters..." and an onChange handler that updates the search query. This confirms the existence of a search input that filters characters by name.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  The code uses a loading state and renders a loading container with a spinner and "Loading characters..." text when loading is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  The default state for searchQuery is an empty string. The useEffect hook calls fetchCharacters with the debounced search query (which is initially empty), ensuring that data is fetched on mount.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  The onChange event on the <input> updates the searchQuery state, and the useDebounce hook along with the useEffect hook trigger new API calls when the debounced search query changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  The implementation checks for the condition where there are no search results (characters.length === 0) and renders a div with a message indicating that no characters match the search query.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The CSS includes container width controls, max-width properties, and responsive input widths to adapt to varying screen sizes. Although basic, these styles are sufficient for a responsive design. Confidence is slightly less than 100% because the responsiveness may not be fully comprehensive for all devices without media queries.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  When the API call returns data, the code maps over the “characters” array to render each character’s name in a list, ensuring that search results are properly displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  An ErrorBoundary component is implemented and wraps the main CharacterList component, handling errors during rendering by displaying a fallback UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The code defines a Character interface for API data, and React.FC is used appropriately with TypeScript. Even the ErrorBoundary component is typed using React’s generics. This ensures proper type definitions are in place.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The code integrates the new search functionality (with debouncing and API calls) without removing or breaking the core functionality of fetching and displaying Star Wars characters. All original aspects, such as displaying a list, handling errors, and loading states, are intact.
