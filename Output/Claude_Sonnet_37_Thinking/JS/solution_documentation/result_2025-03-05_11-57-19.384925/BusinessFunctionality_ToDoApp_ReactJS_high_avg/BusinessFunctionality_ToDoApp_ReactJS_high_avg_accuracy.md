# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps:

1. **Confirm that constraints related to local storage limitations are noted.**
   - **Pass**: The report mentions that localStorage has size limitations (typically 5-10MB).

2. **Verify that assumptions about the application being designed for a single user are mentioned.**
   - **Pass**: The report states that the application is designed for personal use with a reasonable number of todos.

3. **Ensure that browser compatibility assumptions are included.**
   - **Pass**: The report mentions that the application assumes a modern browser with localStorage support and requires JavaScript to be enabled.

4. **Check that performance-related constraints are noted.**
   - **Pass**: The report discusses performance constraints, such as all todos being loaded into memory at once and the limitations of localStorage.

5. **Confirm that performance optimizations, such as the use of `shouldComponentUpdate`, are identified.**
   - **Pass**: The report identifies the use of `shouldComponentUpdate` in TodoItem to prevent unnecessary rerenders.

6. **Verify that considerations for using immutable data structures for performance are mentioned.**
   - **Pass**: The report mentions the use of immutable data patterns (map, filter, reduce) instead of direct mutations.

7. **Ensure scalability considerations related to local storage limitations are discussed.**
   - **Pass**: The report discusses the limitations of localStorage and the potential issues with very large lists.

8. **Check that the potential need for a backend service for better scalability is mentioned.**
   - **Fail**: The report does not mention the potential need for a backend service for better scalability.

9. **Confirm that the evaluation steps are unambiguous and concise.**
   - **Pass**: The evaluation steps are clear and concise.

10. **Ensure that each step allows the evaluator to assess the output based solely on the provided code.**
    - **Pass**: Each step is designed to allow assessment based on the provided code.

11. **Verify that the steps are clearly articulated and cover all main points of the task.**
    - **Pass**: The steps are clearly articulated and cover the main points of the task.
