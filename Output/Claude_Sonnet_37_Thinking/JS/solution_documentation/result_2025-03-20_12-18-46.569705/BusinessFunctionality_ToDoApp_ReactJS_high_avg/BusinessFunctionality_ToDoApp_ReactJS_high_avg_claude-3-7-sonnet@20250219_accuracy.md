# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document identifies the application as a Todo list management application
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the component structure (TodoApp, TodoItem, TodoFooter)
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of local storage for data persistence
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the state management approach using the TodoModel
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the routing mechanism for filtering todos
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the event handling for user interactions
- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of immutable data structures for state management

    The document mentions the use of immutable data patterns through non-mutating array operations like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`. While this indicates an understanding of immutable data handling, it doesn't explicitly state whether a specific immutable data library (like Immutable.js) is used or if it's just using JavaScript's non-mutating array methods. This creates a slight ambiguity, hence the 90% confidence.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the performance optimization using shouldComponentUpdate
- **Fail** (80%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of the Utils class for helper functions

    The document does not specifically mention a Utils class for helper functions. While it references the "Classnames utility" for conditional CSS application, it doesn't explicitly discuss a Utils class that might contain helper functions for the application. Since the document comprehensively covers other technical aspects, it's likely this class either doesn't exist in the codebase or wasn't deemed significant enough to mention in the business requirements documentation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the data flow between components
