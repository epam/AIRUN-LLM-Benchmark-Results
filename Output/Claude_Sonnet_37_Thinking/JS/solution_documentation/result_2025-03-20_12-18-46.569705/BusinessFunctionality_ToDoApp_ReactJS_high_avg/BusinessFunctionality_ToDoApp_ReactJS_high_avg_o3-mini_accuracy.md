# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document identifies the application as a Todo list management application  
  The document explicitly states that this is a "Business Requirements Documentation for React Todo Application" and describes it as a "classic Todo List manager" with CRUD functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the component structure (TodoApp, TodoItem, TodoFooter)  
  The document clearly outlines the component structure by naming and describing the roles of TodoApp, TodoItem, and TodoFooter along with the TodoModel.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of local storage for data persistence  
  The section on "Persist data" mentions using browser's localStorage, explicitly indicating data persistence via local storage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the state management approach using the TodoModel  
  The document explains that the TodoModel class manages task data, handles data operations, and uses a publish-subscribe pattern for UI updates, which accurately indicates state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the routing mechanism for filtering todos  
  It mentions that the TodoApp component "Manages routing and filtering state" and further discusses "URL-based routing" in the UI/UX patterns.
