# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Verify that all React components and their functionalities are correctly translated into Angular components.
- **Pass**: All components from the provided code are Angular components, and their functionalities are correctly translated.

### Step 2: Ensure that the form validation logic is implemented using Angular reactive forms.
- **Pass**: The form validation logic is implemented using Angular reactive forms in `signup.component.ts`.

### Step 3: Check that the application includes the necessary form controls and validation rules.
- **Pass**: The application includes necessary form controls (`name`, `email`, `password`) and validation rules in `signup.component.ts` and `signup-validators.ts`.

### Step 4: Confirm that the application correctly binds the form controls and handles form submission.
- **Pass**: The form controls are correctly bound using `formControlName` in `signup.component.html`, and form submission is handled in `handleSubmit` method in `signup.component.ts`.

### Step 5: Ensure the application correctly displays form validation errors.
- **Pass**: Form validation errors are displayed using the `app-form-group` component, which checks for errors and displays messages accordingly.

### Step 6: Verify that the application contains actions for signup, signup success, and signup failure.
- **Pass**: The application contains an action for signup success (`signupComplete` in `auth.actions.ts`). However, there is no explicit action for signup failure.

### Step 7: Ensure that the auth.effects.ts file correctly handles side effects using @ngrx/effects, including calling the API and dispatching success or failure actions.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include `auth.effects.ts` file, so it cannot be verified if side effects are handled using `@ngrx/effects`.

### Step 8: Validate that the API call to signup is correctly integrated and that the response is handled properly.
- **Pass**: The API call to signup is correctly integrated in `auth.service.ts`, and the response is handled in `handleSubmit` method in `signup.component.ts`.

### Step 9: Confirm that the application navigates to the login page correctly when the link is clicked.
- **Pass**: The application navigates to the login page using `routerLink="/login"` in `signup.component.html`.

## Summary
- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 9
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 8
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 1

Overall, the migration to Angular 14.x is mostly successful, with the exception of the missing `auth.effects.ts` file for handling side effects using `@ngrx/effects`.
