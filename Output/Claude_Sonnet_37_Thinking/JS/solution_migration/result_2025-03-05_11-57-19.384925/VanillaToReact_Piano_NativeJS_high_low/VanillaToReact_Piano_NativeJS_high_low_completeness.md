# Evaluation Report

## Steps

### Step 1: Verify the application contains a button container with "Notes" and "Letters" buttons.
**Pass**: The `Piano` component contains a `div` with the class `btn-container` that includes two buttons: one with the class `btn-notes` and another with the class `btn-letters`.

### Step 2: Verify the application renders piano keys for both natural and sharp notes.
**Pass**: The `Piano` component renders `div` elements with the class `piano-key` for natural notes and `piano-key sharp` for sharp notes.

### Step 3: Verify clicking on a piano key plays the correct sound and highlights the key.
**Pass**: The `play` function in the `Piano` component handles mouse clicks on piano keys, plays the corresponding sound, and adds the `piano-key-active` class to highlight the key.

### Step 4: Verify releasing the mouse button or moving the cursor out of the key stops the sound and removes the highlight.
**Pass**: The `resetActive` function in the `Piano` component handles mouse button release and cursor movement out of the key, removing the `piano-key-active` class.

### Step 5: Verify pressing and releasing keyboard keys play and stop the corresponding piano notes.
**Pass**: The `useEffect` hook in the `Piano` component adds event listeners for `keydown` and `keyup` events, calling the `play` and `resetActive` functions respectively.

### Step 6: Verify clicking the "Notes" button displays note names on the keys.
**Pass**: The `change` function in the `Piano` component handles clicks on the "Notes" button, setting the `showLetters` state to `false`, which controls the display of note names.

### Step 7: Verify clicking the "Letters" button displays letter names on the keys.
**Pass**: The `change` function in the `Piano` component handles clicks on the "Letters" button, setting the `showLetters` state to `true`, which controls the display of letter names.

### Step 8: Verify the fullscreen button toggles fullscreen mode for the application.
**Pass**: The `handleFullscreen` function in the `Main` component toggles fullscreen mode when the fullscreen button is clicked.

### Step 9: Verify the application correctly handles simultaneous multiple key presses.
**Pass**: The `play` function in the `Piano` component checks if a note is already in the `playedNotes` state before playing it, allowing for simultaneous multiple key presses.
