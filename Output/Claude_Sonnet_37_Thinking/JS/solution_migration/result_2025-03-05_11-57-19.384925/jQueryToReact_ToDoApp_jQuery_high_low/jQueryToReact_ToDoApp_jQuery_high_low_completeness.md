# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
- **Pass**: The `Header` component contains an input field with the class `new-todo`. The `handleKeyUp` function listens for the Enter key and dispatches the `addTodo` action with the value from the state.

### Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
- **Pass**: The `TodoList` component uses the `useParams` hook to get the current filter and dispatches the `setFilter` action. The `getFilteredTodos` function filters the todos based on the current filter.

### Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
- **Pass**: The `TodoList` component includes a checkbox with the class `toggle-all` that toggles the completion status of all todos by dispatching the `toggleAllTodos` action.

### Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItem` component includes a checkbox to toggle the completion status, a label that can be double-clicked to start editing, and a button with the class `destroy` to delete the todo. The corresponding actions (`toggleTodo`, `updateTodo`, `deleteTodo`) are dispatched appropriately.

### Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItem` component handles double-clicking to start editing, pressing Enter to submit the edited todo, and pressing Esc to reset the editing state. The `handleDoubleClick`, `handleKeyUp`, and `handleSubmit` functions manage these actions.

### Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
- **Pass**: The `Footer` component displays the count of active items, includes filter links, and a button to clear completed items. The `clearCompletedTodos` action is dispatched when the button is clicked.

### Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
- **Pass**: The `Footer` component includes a button with the class `clear-completed` that dispatches the `clearCompletedTodos` action when clicked.
