# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately
- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation
- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization

    The code includes a custom `useTranslation` hook with a simple implementation, which is mentioned as a "simplified version for the migration example". While this works as a demonstration, it's not using a proper i18n library like react-i18next or react-intl as would normally be recommended for a production application.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization

    There is no evidence of code splitting implementation in the provided code. Code splitting would typically be implemented using React.lazy() and Suspense or dynamic imports to load components only when needed, but these patterns are absent in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations

    There is no implementation of React.memo for any component in the code. React.memo would be used to memoize components that might re-render unnecessarily due to parent re-renders when their props haven't changed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models
- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks
