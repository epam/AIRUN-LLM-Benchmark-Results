# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented

    The provided React code does not completely implement all page management functionality. While the code includes functions for creating, updating, and deleting pages, the duplicate functionality is incomplete. The `handleSavePage` function has a `duplicate` parameter, but the actual duplication logic is not fully implemented. The PageActions component includes an onDuplicate prop and button, but the implementation of this functionality is missing in the PageEditor component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present

    The page type selection functionality is implemented through the `handleTypeChange` function in the PageForm component that dispatches the `setType` action. The form includes a select element with options populated from the `page.themePages` array.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists

    URL auto-generation from title functionality is implemented in the `handleTitleChange` function in the PageForm component. When `autoURL` is true, it converts the title to a URL-friendly format by lowercasing it, replacing spaces with hyphens, and removing special characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented

    Tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented through the TagInput component, which fetches tag suggestions using `pageApi.getTagSuggestions()`. The component handles adding, removing, and suggesting tags with appropriate UI elements.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available

    The publish status options are implemented in the PageForm component with radio buttons for "publish" (Y), "draft" (N), and "schedule" options. The `handlePublishChange` function updates the publish status in the Redux store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented

    Scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented in the PageForm component. When the "schedule" option is selected, a datetime input field appears. The `handleScheduleDateChange` function updates the scheduleDate in the Redux store.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present

    Local storage version comparison and restoration features are implemented in the PageEditor component. The code checks for newer versions in localStorage and provides a VersionNotice component with options to use or discard the local version.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented

    A notification system is implemented using Redux. The Notification component displays messages stored in the UI state. The code dispatches notifications for various actions (success/error) using the `setNotification` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present

    Form validation for required fields is implemented in the `handleSavePage` function. It checks if the page type is selected and if the URL is provided and not set to 'new', displaying appropriate error notifications if validations fail.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled

    The API endpoints are properly handled through the apiClient and endpoints files. The pageApi and userApi objects provide methods for all necessary API operations, including content management, tag operations, extras management, and user operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented

    Extras management functionality is implemented in the `handleSavePage` function. It includes logic to delete existing extras and add new ones when saving a page. The extras are stored in the page object in the Redux store.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained

    While the code includes a call to `pageApi.addRevision()` when saving a page, the full revision history functionality is not implemented. There's no UI component or logic to view, compare, or restore previous revisions. The `addRevisionExtra` method exists in the API but is never used in the components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components

    The code is well-organized into feature folders with clear separation of concerns. Business logic is separated from UI components through Redux slices, custom hooks, and API services. The project structure shows logical organization with directories for components, store, hooks, api, types, and utils.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved

    Translation functionality is preserved through the `useTranslation
