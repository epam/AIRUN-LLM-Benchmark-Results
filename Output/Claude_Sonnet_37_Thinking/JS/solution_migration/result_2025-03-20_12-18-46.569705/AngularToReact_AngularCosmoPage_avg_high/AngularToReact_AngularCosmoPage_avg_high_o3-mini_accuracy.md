# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props.  
  All components, functions, and props are defined using TypeScript with appropriate interfaces and types. Minor looseness (e.g., use of Record<string, any>) is acceptable in many real-world scenarios.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management.  
  The code employs Redux Toolkit’s createSlice for state management in multiple slices (pageSlice, userSlice, uiSlice).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components.  
  All components in the solution are implemented as functional components.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately.  
  The code uses useState, useEffect, and useCallback appropriately. Although there is no explicit useMemo, it doesn’t appear necessary given the component logic. The slight concern is that useMemo might further optimize expensive computations, but its absence is acceptable here.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource.  
  The implementation uses axios for API communication, fulfilling the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components.  
  The solution uses controlled components (for instance, in FormField and TagInput) where values are managed via state and onChange handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation.  
  React Router hooks such as useParams, useNavigate, and useLocation are used appropriately to manage navigation.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization.  
  The solution provides a simplistic custom hook (useTranslation) instead of integrating a well-established i18n library like react-i18next. This simplistic approach may suffice for simple translations but does not provide the full range of i18n features typically expected.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization.  
  There is no indication of code splitting (e.g., dynamic imports, React.lazy, or Suspense) in the migration, which could be an important performance optimization.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations.  
  The code does not use React.memo or similar optimizations for memoizing components, which might be beneficial for expensive or frequently re-rendered components.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks.  
  The dependency arrays in hooks like useEffect and useCallback are generally correct. There is a minor caution regarding ensuring all variables and functions used inside these hooks are included, but overall the usage appears appropriate.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models.  
  Interfaces for Page, User, Notification, and other data models are defined and used across the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state.  
  The solution consistently uses Redux selectors (via useSelector) to access state data in components.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations.  
  Action creators are appropriately defined within each slice to manage state mutations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks.  
  The custom hook useLocalStorage leverages React’s useState and useEffect to manage local storage operations effectively.
