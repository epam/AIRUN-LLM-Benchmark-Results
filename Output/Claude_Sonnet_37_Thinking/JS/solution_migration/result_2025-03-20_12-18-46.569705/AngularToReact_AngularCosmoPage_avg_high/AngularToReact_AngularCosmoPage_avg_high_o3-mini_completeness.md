# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
  The code’s PageEditor component and associated Redux actions support creating, updating, deleting, and duplicating pages. The handleSavePage function manages new pages and updates, and delete functionality is appropriately implemented.  
  (Confidence is 95% because while the primary functions are present, distinguishing nuances in duplicate behavior could be explored further.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
  The PageForm component includes a select dropdown for the page type, ensuring that users can choose from available types.  
  (Confidence is 100% as the functionality is clear and straightforward.)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
  The handleTitleChange function in PageForm auto-generates the URL by converting the title to lowercase, replacing spaces with dashes, and removing special characters when autoURL is enabled.  
  (Confidence is 100% because the code explicitly implements URL auto-generation.)

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
  The TagInput component fetches tag suggestions via the pageApi.getTagSuggestions call and allows adding or removing tags while displaying autocomplete suggestions.  
  (Confidence is 100% as both tag input and suggestion functionality are covered.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
  The PageForm component provides radio buttons for publishing options (publish, draft, and schedule) and handles changes accordingly.  
  (Confidence is 100% because each option is visibly implemented.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
  When the schedule option is selected, the PageForm renders a datetime-local input, and scheduleDate is properly managed in both the Redux slice and the savePage logic.  
  (Confidence is 100% as the scheduled date functionality is clearly implemented.)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
  In the PageEditor component, localStorage is checked for a newer version of page details. The component provides options to restore or delete this local version through VersionNotice.  
  (Confidence is 100% because the code includes the necessary logic for local version comparison and restoration.)

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
  A Notification component is present which displays notifications managed by Redux, with automatic clearing after a timeout. Additionally, various actions dispatch notifications on success or error.  
  (Confidence is 100% as the notification system is fully implemented.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
  The handleSavePage function in PageEditor checks that the page type and URL are set before proceeding. If validations fail, appropriate notifications are dispatched.  
  (Confidence is 100% because the validation logic for required fields is evident.)

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
  The api/endpoints.ts file defines endpoints for pages, tags, extras, revisions, and users, and these endpoints are used throughout the components.  
  (Confidence is 90% because while all primary endpoints appear to be covered, edge-case error handling for each API function could be further verified.)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
  Extras are managed in the PageEditor component during the save process, with API calls to delete and add extras, and are represented in the Redux state.  
  (Confidence is 100% as the extras management features are clearly present.)

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
  After saving a page, the code explicitly calls pageApi.addRevision to record a revision of the page data, ensuring that revision history is maintained.  
  (Confidence is 100% as the revision functionality is clearly incorporated.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
  The project structure is well organized with folders for api, components (further divided into common and pages), hooks, store, types, and utils, which shows a clear separation of concerns.  
  (Confidence is 100% because the directory structure clearly reflects a modular design.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
  The useTranslation hook and its integration across components (e.g., PageForm, PageActions, VersionNotice) ensure that translation functionality is preserved.  
  (Confidence is 100% since translations are used consistently.)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
  The use of React Router’s useParams and navigation logic in PageEditor suggests that the original URL structure is maintained, as the page URL is parsed and used in API calls accordingly.  
  (Confidence is 100% as the routing and URL parameter handling appear consistent with the requirements.)
