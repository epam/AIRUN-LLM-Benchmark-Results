    - Email field with required and email validators
    - Password field with required and minLength validators

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the FormGroup component or equivalent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display

    The FormGroupComponent is fully implemented with:
    - Input to receive the form control
    - Methods to check control status (touched, valid, invalid)
    - Error message handling for different validation errors
    - HTML template that displays the form group with appropriate styling and error messages

    - Email: required, email format
    - Password: required, minLength(6)

    Asynchronous validation is implemented for both name and email:

    - Both update the asyncValidating flag appropriately
