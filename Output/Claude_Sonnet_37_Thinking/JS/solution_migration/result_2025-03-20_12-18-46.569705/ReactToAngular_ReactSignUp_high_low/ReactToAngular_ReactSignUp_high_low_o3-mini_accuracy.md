# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The component initializes a FormGroup using FormBuilder and the AppModule imports ReactiveFormsModule.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The validators on the form fields include Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3) and Validators.maxLength(60) for name, Validators.email for email, and Validators.minLength(6) for password.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  Both the name and email fields use custom asynchronous validators (nameAsyncValidator and emailAsyncValidator) that call the corresponding API methods to determine if the values are already in use.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The FormGroupComponent applies conditional CSS classes ("has-error" and "has-success") based on the touched, valid, and invalid state of the control, and displays error messages accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  The onSubmit method verifies the form validity, calls the signup API, and on success dispatches the signupComplete action via @ngrx/store.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  Error messages are conditionally rendered in the FormGroupComponent’s template via a <span> element. However, there is a minor concern regarding the error handling logic (e.g., a conditional check for both minlength and maxlength for the 'name' field, and a reference to control.name for password) which could lead to unexpected behavior if the control does not expose a name property. This nuance causes a slight reduction in confidence.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  The component’s ngOnInit method calls titleService.setTitle with a helper function getTitle, ensuring the page title is set to "Signup - PodBaby."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The component dispatches actions via the injected Store and an effect (signified in auth.effects.ts) listens for the signupComplete action to perform routing, confirming state management integration.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button is disabled using the expression [disabled]="submitting || asyncValidating", ensuring user actions are blocked during async operations or submission.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  In onSubmit, the API call returns an observable that subscribes to both success and error callbacks, with appropriate state updates (e.g., setting submitting to false in both cases).

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component properly initializes its data in ngOnInit, clearly separates concerns (using separate components and services), and adheres to an organized file structure. Minor subjective points (like small potential ambiguities in error-handling logic) reduce confidence slightly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The provided ApiService correctly uses HttpClient’s get and post methods for API calls.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  Error messages are defined for various validation failures (e.g., required fields, invalid email, name or email already in use). However, the error message logic for the name and password fields contains conditions that might not cover all cases exactly as intended (for instance, combining minlength and maxlength checks, and referencing control.name for password validation). This introduces a slight concern even though the overall intent is met.
