- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The code clearly uses Angular framework with imports from '@angular/core' and other Angular-specific packages. The structure follows Angular conventions with modules, components, services, and the use of decorators like @Component, @Input, and @Output.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management

  The code includes '@ngrx/effects' with a complete TodoEffects class that properly handles side effects for all CRUD operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
  
  The code has well-structured actions (todo.actions.ts), reducer (todo.reducer.ts), and selectors (todo.selectors.ts) files that follow NgRx patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
  
  The components properly use @Component decorator for component definition, @Input for incoming properties, and @Output for event emitters.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators
  
  React refs have been properly replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators, as seen in the TodoItemComponent and TodoAppComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
  
  The components use @Input() for receiving data and @Output() with EventEmitter for sending events to parent components, following Angular's component communication pattern.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
  
  The code includes a TodoService that handles data persistence and business logic, following Angular's service pattern.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
  
  Dependency injection is correctly implemented with services injected via constructor parameters and with appropriate provider configurations.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
  
  ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush is applied to components where appropriate for optimized change detection.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
  
  The code includes an AppRoutingModule with properly configured routes and RouterModule integration.

  The code follows Angular style guide conventions with proper naming, file organization, and component structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
  
  TypeScript interfaces and types are properly defined and used throughout the application, including Todo, TodoState and other interfaces.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
  
  JSX templates have been properly converted to Angular HTML templates with appropriate Angular-specific directives and binding syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
  
  React event handlers like onClick have been properly replaced with Angular event bindings like (click).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs
  
  The provided code doesn't contain any TODO comments or unfinished features.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules
  
  The application doesn't implement lazy loading for feature modules. The AppModule loads all components directly, rather than using the loadChildren syntax for lazy loading in the routing configuration.
