# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items

    The application correctly displays all todo items through the `filteredTodos$` observable in the `TodoAppComponent`, rendering them with `*ngFor="let todo of filteredTodos$ | async"` in the HTML template.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented

    The application implements adding new todo items through the `handleNewTodoKeyDown` method in `TodoAppComponent`, which dispatches the `addTodo` action when the Enter key is pressed with a valid todo title.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works

    Toggling todo items is implemented through the `toggle` method in `TodoAppComponent`, which dispatches the `toggleTodo` action with the appropriate todo item.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented

    Editing todo items is fully implemented with methods such as `edit`, `save`, and `cancel` in the `TodoAppComponent` that handle the editing state through NgRx actions like `setEditing` and `updateTodo`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented

    The application implements deleting todo items through the `destroy` method in `TodoAppComponent`, which dispatches the `deleteTodo` action with the todo to be removed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented

    The 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented through the `toggleAll` method in `TodoAppComponent`, which dispatches the `toggleAll` action with the completed state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works

    Filtering is implemented through the router and NgRx store. The `TodoAppComponent` subscribes to router events and dispatches the `setFilter` action based on the current URL path.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items

    The footer correctly displays the count of active items with `[count]="activeTodoCount$ | async"` binding in the `TodoFooterComponent`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items

    The 'Clear completed' button is implemented with the `clearCompleted` method in `TodoAppComponent`, which dispatches the `clearCompleted` action to remove all completed items.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage

    Todo items are persisted to local storage through the `Utils.store` method which is used in the `TodoService` for all CRUD operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation

    The application maintains the URL structure for navigation with routes defined in `app-routing.module.ts` for '/', '/active', and '/completed'.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states

    The application conditionally displays UI elements based on the todo list state with `*ngIf="hasTodos$ | async"` for the main section and `*ngIf="(activeTodoCount$ | async) > 0 || (completedTodoCount$ | async) > 0"` for the footer.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly

    Form submissions are handled correctly through event handlers like `handleNewTodoKeyDown` and the `handleSubmit` method in `TodoItemComponent`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships

    The application maintains proper component relationships with clear parent-child hierarchies and well-defined inputs/outputs between components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved

    All business logic is preserved and correctly migrated to Angular's architecture using NgRx for state management, Angular services for data operations, and Angular components for the UI.
