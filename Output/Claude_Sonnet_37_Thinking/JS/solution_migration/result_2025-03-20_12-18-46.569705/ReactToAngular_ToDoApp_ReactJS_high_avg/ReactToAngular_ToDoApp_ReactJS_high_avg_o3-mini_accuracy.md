# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The answer explicitly states “Angular 14.x” in its title and uses Angular conventions throughout the code (modules, decorators, etc.). This meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The solution integrates NgRx by using StoreModule.forRoot with a todoReducer defined to manage state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  The code includes an effects file (todo.effects.ts) which implements several effects using NgRx’s createEffect and ofType.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  The answer provides clearly defined actions (in todo.actions.ts), reducers (in todo.reducer.ts), and selectors (in todo.selectors.ts) that cover various functionalities.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  Each component is defined with the @Component decorator and uses @Input for property binding and @Output combined with EventEmitter for emitting events.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  React refs have been replaced appropriately by @ViewChild in components like TodoItemComponent and TodoAppComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  The sample demonstrates correct usage of @Input and @Output in multiple components (e.g., TodoItemComponent and TodoFooterComponent).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  The TodoService encapsulates data handling (including localStorage management) and business logic, which is consistent with Angular best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  Services and effects are injected using Angular’s DI system (e.g., injecting TodoService into TodoEffects, and Store and Router into TodoAppComponent).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  Several components (TodoItemComponent, TodoFooterComponent, TodoAppComponent) are configured with ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  The solution includes an AppRoutingModule that sets up routing for different todo filter views.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The application code structure (modularization, naming, separation of concerns) follows common Angular style guidelines.  
  (Explanation: While the overall style appears compliant, there might be minor deviations from the official Angular style guide that are not explicitly evident in the segments provided.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  Interfaces (such as Todo and TodoState) are defined and used consistently in the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  All templates are provided as Angular HTML files (or inline as in AppComponent) rather than JSX code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  The original React event binding mechanism has been entirely replaced with Angular’s event binding syntax (e.g., (click), (keydown)).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  There are no TODO comments present in the provided code. Although the placeholder “What needs to be done?” exists in the new-todo input’s placeholder text, it is not a code comment marking a TODO.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  The application does not demonstrate lazy loading of feature modules; all routes are directly mapped to the TodoAppComponent. In a large Angular application, lazy loading for specific modules is commonly recommended.
