# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The App component’s template uses an async pipe on the filtered todos observable. The NgRx selector and component bindings ensure that all todos (filtered or otherwise) are displayed in the list.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoAppComponent listens for the Enter key event in the new todo input field and dispatches the addTodo action. The TodoService then persists the new todo to local storage and returns it via an observable.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  Both individual toggling (via the TodoItemComponent emitting a toggle event) and the “Mark all as complete” checkbox (dispatching a toggleAll action) are correctly implemented with NgRx effects updating the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent supports editing via a double-click which triggers an edit event; it utilizes local input bindings and emits save/cancel events. The TodoAppComponent dispatches a setEditing action and processes updateTodo accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent has a “destroy” button which dispatches a delete action. The reducer and service correctly filter out the deleted todo while updating local storage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  The main component includes a checkbox with a corresponding event handler that dispatches a toggleAll action, updating all todos’ completed status.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  The routing is configured for "", "/active", and "/completed" and selectors are used to filter the todos accordingly. This ensures that the UI reflects the proper filtered list based on the route.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooterComponent receives the active todo count via an observable from the NgRx store and correctly pluralizes and displays the number of remaining items.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The footer has a “Clear completed” button that dispatches a clearCompleted action when clicked, and the reducer/service remove todos that are completed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  The TodoService uses a Utility method (Utils.store) to both retrieve and store todos in local storage, ensuring persistence across sessions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The AppRoutingModule defines routes for "", "active", and "completed" along with a wildcard redirect, preserving the expected URL navigation structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  The App component conditionally renders the main section and footer based on the existence of todos (using an async observable result). This approach adequately handles empty state display (i.e., when there are no todos).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  The new todo input field correctly prevents default behavior on Enter key press, trims the value, and dispatches an action only when non-empty, ensuring proper form handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The application is modularized into separate components (TodoAppComponent, TodoItemComponent, TodoFooterComponent) and services with clear responsibilities and proper event/input bindings, maintaining good component relationships.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  The logic for adding, toggling, editing, deleting, filtering, and persisting todos is fully migrated and maintained using NgRx, Angular routing, and services, matching the original React TypeScript application's functionality.
