# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The migration header and project files clearly indicate that Angular 14.x is in use.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
  All module imports and exports are handled using ES modules, and there is no usage of RequireJS.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
  The code includes proper NgRx Store imports, reducers, actions, and integration within the module.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
  NgRx Effects are correctly implemented and integrated for handling side effects in the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
  The provided code defines actions, reducers, selectors, and effects explicitly for todo management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
  The TodoStorageService is marked with @Injectable and properly provided in the root.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
  The TodoStorageService uses localStorage methods for retrieving and saving todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
  All components (TodoInputComponent, TodoItemComponent, TodoListComponent, TodoFooterComponent, AppComponent) use the @Component decorator appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
  Both custom directives (TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective) correctly use the @Directive decorator.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
  The templates include proper Angular structural directives such as *ngFor and *ngIf.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
  Event bindings like (click) and (submit) are used correctly throughout the components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
  Property bindings are correctly applied in the templates (e.g., [class.completed]="todo.completed").

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
  Lifecycle hooks such as ngOnInit and ngOnChanges are utilized appropriately in the components and directives.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
  The Todo data model is defined as a TypeScript interface in the models directory.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
  Dependency injection is applied correctly; services and the Store are injected in components and effects.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code is modular, follows a clear project structure, and uses Angular constructs correctly. However, minor improvements (like a more streamlined observable usage in the TodoItemComponent) could be considered, hence the slightly lower confidence (95%).

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
  Based on the quality and standard implementation patterns used, it is assumed that the application would run without console errors or warnings. There is a 90% confidence here because runtime behavior isnâ€™t directly observable, though the code appears solid.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
  TypeScript is utilized properly across the codebase, with interfaces, type annotations, and module imports/exports.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
  The provided code is clean with no stray TODO comments or unnecessary commented-out code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows the single responsibility principle in component design  
  Each component, directive, service, and state management file has a clear, singular purpose.
