# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list  
  The provided code includes the TodoListComponent that is clearly responsible for displaying the list of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos  
  The TodoInputComponent is implemented to add new todos by dispatching an addTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos  
  Editing functionality is incorporated into the TodoItemComponent. It handles starting, finishing, and canceling edits for each todo item.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos  
  The TodoFooterComponent contains filter links for "All", "Active", and "Completed", which allows filtering of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics  
  The TodoFooterComponent displays the count of remaining todos and shows statistics, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos  
  The addTodo method in TodoInputComponent dispatches an action to add a new todo after input validation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos  
  The TodoItemComponent provides methods (startEditing, finishEditing, cancelEditing) to handle the editing of an existing todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos  
  A removeTodo method in TodoItemComponent dispatches the removeTodo action to delete a todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed  
  The TodoItemComponent includes the toggleComplete method, which toggles a todo’s completed status through dispatching an update action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)  
  The code utilizes selectors and dispatches a setFilter action in the TodoFooterComponent to handle filtering based on the chosen criteria.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete  
  The TodoListComponent contains a toggle-all checkbox that dispatches the markAllTodos action to mark all todos as complete or incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos  
  The TodoFooterComponent includes a button that dispatches clearCompletedTodos, effectively clearing completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos  
  The remaining count is calculated in the TodoFooterComponent using the selectRemainingCount selector, satisfying this step.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage  
  The TodoStorageService handles persistence by using localStorage to save todos with a specific storage key.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization  
  The loadTodos effect in TodoEffects retrieves todos using the TodoStorageService during application initialization.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing  
  The TodoEscapeDirective listens for the escape key and emits an event, which is then used to cancel editing in the TodoItemComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo  
  The TodoFocusDirective triggers focus on the input element when the associated condition is true, meeting this requirement.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original  
  The application’s index.html imports the todomvc CSS files, and the component structure follows the TodoMVC layout. Although visual appearance can be subjective, the usage of original styles suggests the design is preserved.  
  (Confidence is 90% because visual consistency can depend on external CSS and runtime behavior.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately  
  In both TodoInputComponent and TodoItemComponent, empty (or whitespace-only) titles are handled appropriately by either not adding a new todo or removing a todo when an empty title is submitted.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter  
  The TodoFooterComponent subscribes to router events and checks the updated window.location.hash value to dispatch the proper setFilter action. This dynamic behavior ensures the URL reflects the current filter.
