# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed
  
  The `handleNewTodoKeyDown` function in the Header component correctly captures the Enter key press (keyCode 13), retrieves the input value, trims it, and dispatches the `addTodo` action when the value is non-empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter
  
  The TodoList component implements filtering logic through the `getFilteredTodos` function, which filters todos based on the current filter state ('all', 'active', or 'completed'). The filtered todos are then mapped to TodoItem components in the JSX.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos
  
  The TodoList component includes an input with the "toggle-all" class that dispatches the `toggleAll` action when clicked. The reducer handles this action by setting the completed status of all todos to the provided value.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted
  
  The TodoItem component implements three key functions:
  - `handleToggle`: Dispatches the toggleTodo action
  - `handleEdit`/`handleSubmit`: Manages editing of todo titles
  - `handleDestroy`: Dispatches the removeTodo action

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode
  
  The TodoItem component includes a label with an `onDoubleClick` handler that calls the `handleEdit` function, which sets the component to editing mode by updating the local state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo
  
  The TodoItem component's `handleKeyDown` function checks for the Enter key (keyCode 13) and calls the `handleSubmit` function to commit changes if the key is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value
  
  The TodoItem component's `handleKeyDown` function checks for the Escape key (keyCode 27) and resets the edit text to the original todo title and exits editing mode if the key is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The Footer component calculates `activeTodoCount` and displays it along with the correctly pluralized word 'item' or 'items'.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The Footer component includes a navigation of filter links that dispatch the `setFilter` action with the appropriate filter values ('all', 'active', 'completed').

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos
  
  The Footer component includes a "clear-completed" button that dispatches the `clearCompleted` action when clicked, and is conditionally rendered only when there are completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence
  
  The Redux implementation includes a `todosMiddleware` that saves the todos to localStorage whenever a todos-related action is dispatched. It also loads todos from localStorage during initialization through the `loadTodos` function.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state
  
  The application conditionally renders:
  - TodoList and Footer only when there are todos
  - The "clear completed" button only when there are completed todos
  - Different CSS classes based on todo completion and editing states

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count
  
  The Footer component uses a `pluralize` helper function that adds an 's' to the word 'item' when the count is not equal to 1.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components
  
  The application is broken down into well-defined, focused components:
  - App: Overall application structure
  - Header: Input for creating new todos
  - TodoList: Rendering the list of todos and toggle-all functionality
  - TodoItem: Individual todo management
  - Footer: Filtering and statistics

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality
