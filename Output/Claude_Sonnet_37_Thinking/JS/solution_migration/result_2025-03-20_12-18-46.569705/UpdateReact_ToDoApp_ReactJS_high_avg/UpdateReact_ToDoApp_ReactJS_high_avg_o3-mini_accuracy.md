# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all React imports use React 18.x compatible syntax  
  The code uses the new "react-dom/client" module with the createRoot API, which is fully compatible with React 18.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all components use functional component syntax with hooks instead of class components  
  Every component is implemented as a functional component that utilizes React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, etc.), and no class components are present.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Redux Toolkit's createSlice is used for state management  
  Both the todos slice and the filter slice are created using Redux Toolkit's createSlice, demonstrating adherence to modern state management best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for all props, state, and Redux store  
  Interfaces such as Todo and FilterType are defined in the types file, and components correctly type their props and Redux store usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses immutable state updates in reducers  
  Although mutations appear in the reducers (e.g., using state.push), Redux Toolkit leverages Immer behind the scenes to ensure immutability.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that nanoid is used for ID generation instead of custom UUID implementation  
  The code imports and uses nanoid from Redux Toolkit for generating unique IDs.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application uses React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate  
  Components such as TodoItem and Footer are wrapped with React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that useCallback is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders  
  The code makes effective use of useCallback for event handlers across multiple components.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage handling is implemented in a modern way  
  The implementation for loading and saving todos to localStorage is clean and encapsulated within helper functions and middleware.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows consistent naming conventions throughout the application  
  All files, variables, and components follow a consistent and clear naming convention, making the codebase easy to follow.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that proper error handling is implemented where necessary  
  The application lacks explicit error handling (e.g., try-catch blocks or error boundaries) in areas where errors could potentially occur (such as localStorage operations). While the current implementation works for typical cases, it could be improved by handling potential runtime errors more robustly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware  
  The store is configured with the default middleware from Redux Toolkit augmented by a custom todosMiddleware to handle persistence to localStorage.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that React.lazy is used for code splitting where appropriate  
  There is no use of React.lazy (or dynamic import) for code splitting in the provided code. While the application structure is modular, code splitting could further optimize load performance.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the codebase has no TODOs remaining  
  The code does not include any TODO comments or unfinished tasks.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux Provider wraps the application entry point  
  The entry point wraps the App component with the Redux Provider, ensuring state management is properly integrated.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure strict TypeScript type checking is implemented throughout the application  
  The use of TypeScript interfaces and type annotations throughout the code indicates a strong commitment to strict type checking.
