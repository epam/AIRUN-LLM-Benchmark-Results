# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The Header component listens for the Enter key event via its handleNewTodoKeyDown callback. It dispatches the addTodo action when the Enter key (keyCode === 13) is detected.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The TodoList component filters todos based on the current filter value retrieved from state and then maps over the filtered list to display each item.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  The TodoList component implements a toggleAll functionality by using an input checkbox that calls the toggleAll action with the checkbox’s checked value.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  Within the TodoItem component, there are callbacks to toggle a todo (handleToggle), submit edits (handleSubmit), and remove a todo (handleDestroy) to ensure these actions can be performed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  The TodoItem component triggers the handleEdit callback when the label is double-clicked, which sets the editing state to true.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  The TodoItem component’s handleKeyDown function checks if the Enter key (keyCode === 13) is pressed and then calls handleSubmit to save the changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  The TodoItem component’s handleKeyDown callback correctly checks for the Escape key (keyCode === 27) and resets the edit text to the original todo title while exiting editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  In the Footer component, the activeTodoCount is computed by filtering todos that are not completed and then rendered inside a span element.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The Footer component provides links for each filter state (All, Active, Completed) with click handlers to dispatch the appropriate filter change.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  A clear-completed button is conditionally rendered in the Footer component when there is at least one completed todo, and it dispatches the clearCompleted action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  The todosSlice implements middleware that saves updated todos to localStorage on any todos action, along with initial state retrieval from localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  Both the TodoList and Footer components conditionally render their content based on the existence of todos (e.g., returning null if there are no todos).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  The Footer component uses a pluralize helper function to correctly display the word "item" or "items" based on the number of active todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The code is split into several focused components (Header, TodoList, TodoItem, Footer) that handle distinct parts of the functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The project structure clearly separates the application into directories by functionality (e.g., features/todos, features/filter, app, types), which promotes maintainability and scalability.
