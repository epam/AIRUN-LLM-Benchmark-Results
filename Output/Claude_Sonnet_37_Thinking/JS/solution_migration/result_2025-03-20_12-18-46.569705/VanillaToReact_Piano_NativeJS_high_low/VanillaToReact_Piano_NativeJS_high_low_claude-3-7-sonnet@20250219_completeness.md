# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'
  
  The application includes a Header component which renders a header with the class "header" and an h1 element with the class "header-title" containing the text "Virtual Piano".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons
  
  The ControlPanel component renders a button container with two buttons:
  - A "Notes" button with the class "btn btn-notes"
  - A "Letters" button with the class "btn btn-letters"
  
  The buttons have appropriate toggle functionality with the "btn-active" class applied based on the current state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)
  
  The Piano component renders both natural and sharp keys:
  - Natural keys are rendered directly within the piano div
  - Sharp keys are rendered within a div with the class "keys-sharp"
  - Seven natural keys (c, d, e, f, g, a, b) and five sharp keys (c♯, d♯, f♯, g♯, a♯) are included

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes
  
  Each PianoKey component sets data attributes for both letter and note:
  ```tsx
  <div
    className={className}
    data-letter={letter}
    data-note={note}
    onMouseDown={handleMouseDown}
  ></div>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked
  
  The application creates an AudioMap with all required audio files:
  ```tsx
  const soundMapper: AudioMap = useMemo(() => ({
    'c': new Audio('./assets/audio/c.mp3'),
    'd': new Audio('./assets/audio/d.mp3'),
    // ... and all other notes
  }), []);
  ```
  
  When a key is clicked, the playNote function is called, which plays the correct audio file:
  ```tsx
  const playNote = useCallback((note: string) => {
    if (!note) return;
    
    const sound = soundMapper[note];
    if (sound) {
      sound.currentTime = 0;
      sound.play();
    }
  }, [soundMapper]);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)
  
  The application adds "piano-key-active" class to active keys:
  ```tsx
  const className = `piano-key ${isSharp ? 'sharp' : ''} ${isNone ? 'none' : ''} ${isActive ? 'piano-key-active' : ''}`;
  ```
  
  The active state is tracked using a Set:
  ```tsx
  const [activeNotes, setActiveNotes] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes
  
  The Piano component includes keyboard event handlers:
  ```tsx
  const handleKeyDown = useCallback((event: KeyboardEvent) => {
    const key = event.key.toUpperCase();
    const allKeys = [...naturalKeys, ...sharpKeys.filter(k => k.letter)];
    const pianoKey = allKeys.find(k => k.letter === key);
    
    if (pianoKey) {
      activateNote(pianoKey.note);
    }
  }, [activateNote, naturalKeys, sharpKeys]);
  ```
  
  Event listeners are properly added and cleaned up:
  ```tsx
  useEffect(() => {
    window.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
    window.addEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp);
    
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
      window.removeEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp);
    };
  }, [handleKeyDown, handleKeyUp]);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked
  
  The application uses a state
