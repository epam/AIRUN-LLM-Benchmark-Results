# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration  
  The answer instructs to create the app with:  
  npx create-react-app virtual-piano-react --template typescript  
  and further uses ReactDOM.createRoot in index.tsx, which confirms React 18 usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure  
  The code defines an AudioMap interface in src/types/index.ts and utilizes it in the Piano component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks  
  All components (Header, Footer, Piano, PianoKey, ControlPanel, FullscreenButton, and App) are implemented as functional components that use hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, etc.).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)  
  The application manages UI interactions (active notes, display mode, fullscreen) using appropriate state hooks with useState and useEffect.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels  
  The Piano component sets up global keyboard event listeners (keydown and keyup) via useEffect using useCallback functions, making it well scoped.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events  
  The code leverages React’s synthetic event system with onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseOut, and onMouseMove events for handling mouse interactions on piano keys.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment  
  Audio elements are created with new Audio(...) and cached via useMemo. Although paths like './assets/audio/c.mp3' are used, the provided instructions mention copying assets to the proper public directory. There is a slight uncertainty about path resolution depending on project structure, but given the instructions these details should be managed correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility  
  The FullscreenButton component uses React hooks and promises for requestFullscreen and exitFullscreen, with appropriate error handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns  
  Conditional class names are built using template literals (e.g., in PianoKey.tsx) to conditionally apply classes such as 'sharp', 'none', 'piano-key-active'.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate  
  Components like ControlPanel, PianoKey, and FullscreenButton are wrapped in React.memo; useCallback and useMemo hooks are used to optimize performance.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations  
  Audio playback is managed by resetting the currentTime before play and using memoization (useMemo) to avoid recreating audio objects unnecessarily.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application  
  The majority of the code features explicit type annotations and interface definitions for props and state, ensuring TypeScript’s type-safety.
