# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title "Virtual Piano"  
  The Header component clearly renders an <h1> element with the text "Virtual Piano".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons  
  The ControlPanel component displays two buttons labeled "Notes" and "Letters" inside a container.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)  
  The Piano component maps through two arrays—one for natural keys and one for sharp keys—to render all required PianoKey components, including a container for sharp keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes  
  Each PianoKey component attaches data attributes "data-letter" and "data-note" to its DOM element.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked  
  The playNote function retrieves the corresponding audio from the soundMapper and resets its current time before playing. Although the paths assume proper file placement (e.g., in public/assets/audio/), under the correct setup the functionality appears correct. The 90% confidence accounts for potential file path or asset placement issues depending on the project structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)  
  The PianoKey component dynamically applies the "piano-key-active" class based on the isActive prop, which is governed by the activeNotes state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes  
  Global keyboard event listeners are configured in the Piano component (handleKeyDown and handleKeyUp), associating keyboard presses with the correct notes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked  
  The toggleView function is connected to the onClick events of both toggle buttons, and the Piano element’s CSS class adjusts based on the showNotes state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes  
  The FullscreenButton component implements fullscreen toggling using the browser’s fullscreen API, with proper Promises and error handling.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly  
  The activeNotes state is managed as a Set, allowing multiple keys to be active concurrently. Although this approach supports simultaneous presses, the overall behavior may depend on browser event handling. Confidence is slightly less than 100% due to potential edge cases not explicitly covered in the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys  
  The Piano component implements a handleMouseMove event that activates notes when the mouse is dragged with the primary button pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information  
  The Footer component renders a footer element containing the year "2020".
