# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18.x  
  The code uses ReactDOM.createRoot in index.tsx which is introduced in React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript for type safety  
  The project employs .tsx/.ts files and explicit TypeScript interfaces and types.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for state management  
  The todosSlice.ts file uses createSlice from Redux Toolkit to manage the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm nanoid is used for generating unique IDs  
  The addTodo reducerâ€™s prepare method imports and uses nanoid to generate unique IDs.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code uses functional components with hooks instead of class components  
  All components (e.g., TodoInput, TodoItem, TodoList, TodoFooter, App) are functional and leverage React hooks.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains the same routing functionality with proper route handling  
  The App component sets up routing with react-router-dom, mapping paths ("/all", "/active", "/completed") and redirecting as needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Redux store is properly configured with appropriate slices  
  The store.ts file configures the Redux store with the todos slice.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the Redux provider is set up in the application entry point  
  The index.tsx file wraps the App component in a Provider with the configured Redux store.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for all data structures  
  Interfaces for Todo and FilterType are clearly defined, ensuring type safety across the application.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the code follows React best practices for component composition  
  The code is modular and components are clearly defined; however, slight improvements (e.g., memoization or performance optimizations) might further enhance reusability, hence the 90% confidence.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles keyboard events properly (Enter key for creating/updating todos, Escape key for canceling edits)  
  The TodoInput and TodoItem components handle keyboard events correctly with proper key code checks.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application maintains local storage persistence if implemented  
  The todosSlice includes loadTodos and saveTodos functions which employ localStorage for persistence.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  The code includes try/catch blocks for localStorage access, which helps prevent runtime errors. Without running in a live environment, there's a 90% confidence level that there will be no console errors.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the application implements proper error handling  
  The error handling for localStorage operations using try/catch is in place. Although basic (using console.error), it is sufficient for a TodoMVC application. Confidence is 90% as more robust error recovery could be implemented.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm the code is optimized with no unnecessary re-renders  
  The code follows common performance practices with functional components and hooks. However, without profiling the application in production, there is an 80% confidence level regarding the absence of unnecessary re-renders. Some components could possibly be further optimized with React.memo or other techniques if needed.
