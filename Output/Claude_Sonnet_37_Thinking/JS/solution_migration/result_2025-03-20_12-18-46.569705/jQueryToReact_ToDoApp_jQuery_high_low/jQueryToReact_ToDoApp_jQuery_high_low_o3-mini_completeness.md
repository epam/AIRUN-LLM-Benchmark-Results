# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos  
  The App component renders a header that contains an <code>h1</code> element with "todos" and includes a <code>TodoInput</code> component for adding new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos  
  The TodoList component renders a <code>section</code> with the class "main", which includes a toggle-all checkbox and an unordered list displaying the todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button  
  The TodoItem component shows a checkbox for toggling completion, a label displaying the todo's title, and a delete button to remove the todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode  
  In TodoItem, the label has an <code>onDoubleClick</code> event handler that triggers editing mode, allowing the todo title to be edited.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The TodoFooter component includes filter links (implemented with react-router-dom <code>Link</code> elements) for "All", "Active", and "Completed" states, and the reducer dynamically filters todos based on the selected filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization  
  The footer in TodoFooter shows the count of active todos and correctly uses singular ("item") or plural ("items") based on the count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter  
  The TodoFooter component applies a "selected" class to the link corresponding to the current URL filter, ensuring that the active filter link is visually highlighted.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist  
  The TodoFooter conditionally renders a "Clear completed" button if there is at least one completed todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter  
  The TodoInput component listens for the Enter key (key code 13) and dispatches an action to add a new todo when a valid title is entered.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos  
  In the TodoItem component, changing the checkbox state dispatches the <code>toggleTodo</code> action to update the completion status of the selected todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once  
  The TodoList component includes a toggle-all checkbox that dispatches the <code>toggleAllTodos</code> action to set the completion status for all todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management  
  The TodoItem component switches to an editing mode with an input field. A useEffect hook ensures that when editing is enabled, the input field receives focus and the cursor is placed at the end of the text.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos  
  Each TodoItem includes a delete button (with the class "destroy") that dispatches the <code>deleteTodo</code> action for removing the todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos  
  The "Clear completed" button in TodoFooter dispatches <code>clearCompletedTodos</code> to remove all completed todos from the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status  
  The Redux slice defines selectors that filter todos by their completion status ("all", "active", "completed"), and the filtered list is correctly displayed by the TodoList component.
