# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Vite is configured as the build tool with appropriate configuration files  
  The project contains a well-defined vite.config.ts that sets up the React plugin, alias resolution, and proper server/build configurations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm TypeScript is properly configured with a tsconfig.json file containing correct compiler options  
  The tsconfig.json includes modern compiler options such as ES2020, strict type checking, JSX settings, and alias paths, clearly indicating a proper TypeScript setup.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the React setup includes necessary entry points and proper component structure  
  The project provides a clear entry point in src/main.tsx, and proper component structure with App.tsx and page components, adhering to standard React conventions.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that Redux is implemented with appropriate store configuration, reducers, and actions  
  The project uses @reduxjs/toolkit for configuring the store and slice management, and includes appropriately defined actions and reducers.

  The App.tsx file establishes routes for the home page and a catch-all NotFound component, ensuring proper navigation routing with react-router-dom.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure testing libraries are properly configured with appropriate test setup files  
  Testing is set up using vitest along with @testing-library packages, and a dedicated tests/setup.ts file is present for initializing the testing environment.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate package.json includes correct dependencies with compatible version specifications  
  The package.json correctly lists necessary dependencies for React, Redux, React Router, and their TypeScript typings, along with appropriate devDependencies for the build and testing environment.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm package.json contains scripts for development, building, and testing operations  
  All required scripts (dev, build, lint, preview, test, etc.) are present in package.json, ensuring smooth operations for development, testing, and production builds.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the project structure follows modern React development conventions  
  The file structure includes a clear separation of concerns with folders for components, hooks, pages, store, types, and assets, adhering to modern conventions for scalable React projects.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that configuration files are production-ready with appropriate optimization settings  
  The build and server configurations in vite.config.ts (including the outDir, sourcemaps, and server port settings) along with strict TypeScript settings and ESLint configurations indicate readiness for production deployment.
