# Evaluation Report

### Check that the tests are isolated and do not depend on each other.
- **Pass**: Each test case is self-contained and does not rely on the state or outcome of other tests. The `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks ensure a clean state for each test.

### Validate that the tests adhere to best practices for unit testing.
- **Pass**: The tests are well-structured, focusing on individual units of functionality. They use mocking to isolate components and functions, ensuring that tests are fast and reliable.

### Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
- **Pass**: The code avoids duplication by using helper functions like `renderComponent` and by setting up common props and store configurations in `beforeEach`.

### Verify that the testing environment is set up correctly.
- **Pass**: The `jest.config.js` file is properly configured with the necessary environment settings and setup files.

### Check if a testing library for JavaScript (such as Jest) has been chosen.
- **Pass**: Jest is used as the testing framework, as indicated by the `jest.config.js` file and the `package.json` scripts.

### Validate that dependencies are mocked where necessary, such as API calls.
- **Pass**: Dependencies like API calls and actions are mocked using `jest.mock`, ensuring that tests do not make real network requests or depend on external modules.

### Verify that the test coverage for the code is at least 80%.
- **Pass**: The `jest.config.js` file specifies a coverage threshold of 80% for branches, functions, lines, and statements.

### Confirm that the package.json file includes necessary dependencies and scripts for running tests.
- **Pass**: The `package.json` file includes all necessary dependencies and scripts for running tests, such as `jest`, `@testing-library/react`, and `redux-mock-store`.

### Confirm that the tests use the proper methods and assertions from the chosen testing library.
- **Pass**: The tests use appropriate methods and assertions from Jest and React Testing Library, such as `render`, `screen`, `fireEvent`, and `waitFor`.
