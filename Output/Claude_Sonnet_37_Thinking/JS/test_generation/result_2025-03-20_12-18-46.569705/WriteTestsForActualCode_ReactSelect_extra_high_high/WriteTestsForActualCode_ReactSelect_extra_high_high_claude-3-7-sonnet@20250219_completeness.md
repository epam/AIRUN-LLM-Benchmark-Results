# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist
  
  The provided code includes a comprehensive section specifically for basic rendering tests, which covers default props, custom className, placeholder, initial value, disabled state, multi-value selection, loading state, and ARIA attributes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present
  
  The code includes a dedicated "Keyboard Navigation" test section that thoroughly tests all required keyboard interactions including arrow keys (up/down), Enter, Escape, Tab, and Backspace.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)
  
  The "User Interactions" section includes tests for clicking to open the menu, clicking to select options, clicking to close the menu, and clicking the clear indicator. Hover interactions are implicit in several tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior
  
  The "State Management" section explicitly tests controlled component behavior by verifying that the component updates correctly when controlled props like value and inputValue change.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values
  
  Multiple tests cover these behaviors, including selecting options (in both single and multi-select modes), removing values with backspace and remove buttons, and clearing values using the clear indicator and Escape key.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented
  
  Tests for menu opening via click and keyboard, closing after selection, and closing with the Escape key are all included. The code also tests the onMenuOpen and onMenuClose callbacks.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality
  
  The test suite includes tests for filtering options by typing, handling controlled inputValue, and verifying that only matching options appear when filtering.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist
  
  A dedicated "Multi-Select" section tests adding multiple selections, removing values with backspace and remove buttons, and hiding selected options when the hideSelectedOptions prop is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility
  
  The "Accessibility" section tests ARIA attributes in both open and closed states, screenReaderStatus, required attribute support, and aria-errormessage.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested
  
  The "Edge Cases" section includes tests for empty options arrays, showing the "No options" message when appropriate.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states
  
  Tests for loading states are present, including verifying the loading indicator and custom loading message. Error states are tested via aria-invalid and aria-errormessage attributes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states
  
  The test suite covers both a fully disabled select component and individual disabled options, verifying that disabled options cannot be selected.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance
  
  The test suite doesn't explicitly test with large option sets to verify performance. While the tests cover most functional aspects, performance testing with large datasets is missing.

  The current tests use a small array of 3 options, and there are no specific tests that verify the component's performance with a large number of options.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested
  
  The test suite covers focus and blur events, focus management during keyboard navigation, and verifies that the appropriate option is focused when navigating with arrow keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering
  
  There are specific tests for custom placeholder rendering and proper value rendering in both single and multi-select modes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations
  
  The "Custom Components and Styling" section includes a test for custom formatOptionLabel, verifying that options are rendered with the customized format.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)
  
  The test suite thoroughly tests all these callbacks, verifying they are called with the correct arguments at the appropriate times.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)
