# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources
  
  The test file `test/unit/factories/rest.spec.js` includes thorough tests for the REST factory. It verifies that all required API resources are defined (blocks, blocksRequirements, comments, content, contentExtras, etc.) and tests various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for the content resource and contentTags resource.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly
  
  The test file `test/unit/factories/page.spec.js` includes tests that verify all properties of the Page factory initialize with correct default values (id, title, description, header, subheader, body, url, type, published, etc.) and also tests that properties can be correctly modified.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly
  
  In `test/unit/factories/users.spec.js`, there are tests that verify all properties of the Users factory initialize with correct default values (id, username, name, bio, email, facebook, twitter, photo, role) and also validate that properties can be correctly modified.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods
  
  The `test/unit/controllers/pageCtrl.spec.js` file contains comprehensive tests for all public methods of the pageCtrl controller, including initialization, data management functions, tag management, version management, and page operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller
  
  The pageCtrl tests include a section specifically for "Initialization" that verifies the controller correctly initializes with Page data, sets the scheduleDate to today for new pages, and checks for unsaved versions in localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation
  
  In the "Data Management Functions" section of the pageCtrl tests, there are specific tests for the titleChange function that verify URL auto-generation works correctly when autoURL is true, doesn't auto-generate when autoURL is false, and properly handles special characters in auto-generated URLs.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction
  
  The pageCtrl tests include a test for the saveLocal function that verifies proper interaction with localStorage by checking that localStorage.setItem is called with the correct key-value pairs.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality
  
  In the "Tag Management" section of the pageCtrl tests, there are tests for the autocompleteTags function that verify it correctly queries for tag suggestions and handles empty tags arrays, as well as tests for the selectSuggestion function.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)
  
  The "Page Operations" section of the pageCtrl tests includes comprehensive tests for the savePage function covering all conditional branches: saving a new page, updating an existing page, validating URLs before saving, handling page duplication, and preventing duplication with the same URL.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types
  
  The pageCtrl tests include coverage for edge cases such as empty URLs (validates and prevents saving) and changing page types (updates and broadcasts to settings).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly
  
  The pageCtrl tests include a test for the deletePage function that verifies all necessary REST deletion calls are made (content, contentRevisions, contentRevisionsExtras, contentExtras, contentTags) and that navigation to "new" occurs afterward.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions
  
  The "Version Management" section of the pageCtrl tests verifies the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions through tests for the localVersion function (restores from localStorage) and the deleteNewerVersion function (clears localStorage entries).

- **Pass** (90%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components
  
  The test implementation is comprehensive and covers most of the code paths. The karma.conf.js file is configured with coverage reporting, and the tests appear to cover all the major functionality of the factories and controllers. However, without seeing the actual
