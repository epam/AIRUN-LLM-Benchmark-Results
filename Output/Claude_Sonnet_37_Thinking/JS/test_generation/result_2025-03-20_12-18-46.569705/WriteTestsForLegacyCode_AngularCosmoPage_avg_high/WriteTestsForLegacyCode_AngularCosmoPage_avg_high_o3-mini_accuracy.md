# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)  
  The tests clearly use Jasmine for structuring test cases and Karma for running them.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints  
  The tests correctly use $httpBackend to intercept HTTP calls and verify API endpoint interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation  
  beforeEach and afterEach hooks are consistently used to initialize modules, inject dependencies, and clean up HTTP expectations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls  
  All HTTP interactions are mocked via $httpBackend, ensuring no real API calls occur during tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection  
  The tests consistently use AngularJS dependency injection via module() and inject() functions to provide the required services.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations  
  Promises are handled appropriately by using .then callbacks and $httpBackend.flush() or $rootScope.$apply() where needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies  
  Spies (e.g., on localStorage, $location, and various REST methods) are properly set up to track interactions and simulate behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization  
  The test suite is well-organized into describe and it blocks, making the structure and purpose of each test clear.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls  
  The tests thoroughly cover success paths (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and validate functionality when certain conditions (like empty URL) occur. However, explicit handling of error responses from API calls is less prominent, so there is a slight shortfall in testing error scenarios.  
  Explanation: Although the success scenarios are well-covered, the error handling paths (e.g., API call failures) could be more explicitly simulated to ensure full coverage of error scenarios.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate  
  The tests simulate user interactions by triggering functions that update the UI data (like title changes and tag selection) and verifying the outcomes.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage  
  The use of afterEach (especially with $httpBackend.verifyNoOutstandingExpectation and verifyNoOutstandingRequest) and resetting of local storage values ensures proper cleanup between test cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested  
  The naming conventions in describe and it statements clearly describe the functionality being verified, making it easy to understand test purposes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible  
  Tests focus on observable output (e.g., Page object properties, HTTP responses) rather than internal implementation details, supporting robust and maintainable test practices.
