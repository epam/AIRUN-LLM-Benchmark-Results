# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering  
  The app.test.tsx file contains a test ("should render header, main section and footer") that verifies the rendering of various application parts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos  
  The test "should handle new todo creation on Enter key" confirms that entering a new todo triggers the addTodo functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos  
  The test "should toggle all todos" validates that toggling all todos updates their completed state properly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos  
  The "should filter todos based on active filter" test confirms that the component filters todos appropriately based on the selected filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The test "should clear completed todos" confirms that the clearCompleted functionality behaves as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering  
  The "should render a todo item correctly" test in todoItem.test.tsx ensures that a todo item renders properly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying, and editing todos  
  There are distinct tests for toggling (onToggle), destroying (onDestroy), and editing (double-click triggering onEdit) a todo item.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events  
  The tests validate behavior on key events (Enter and Escape keys), ensuring proper function calls for saving, destroying, or canceling edits.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts  
  Tests cover rendering of singular vs. plural item counts and verify that the text adjusts according to the count.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation  
  The tests assure that only the currently active filter link has the "selected" class and that others do not.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  A test verifies the visibility of the "Clear completed" button when there are completed todos and confirms the callback is fired upon clicking.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving, and destroying todos  
  The todoModel tests include clear tests for addTodo, toggle, save, and destroy functionality, ensuring model adjustments and notifications.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions  
  Tests confirm that subscribers are added correctly via subscribe and are notified by the inform method.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  There is a test ("should remove all completed todos") in todoModel.test.ts that validates the clearCompleted functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation  
  The uuid function is tested for correct format and uniqueness in utils.test.ts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality  
  The utils test for pluralize verifies both singular and plural outputs based on the item count.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations  
  Tests validate that data is saved to localStorage when provided, retrieved when absent, and that a fallback (empty array) is returned when no data exists.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function  
  The extend function is effectively tested with multiple scenarios (merging multiple objects and handling empty objects).

- **Pass** (95%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx  
  Most React component tests follow the .test.tsx convention (e.g., footer.test.tsx, todoItem.test.tsx, app.test.tsx). Non-component utility and model tests are in .test.ts, which is a common practice for non-JSX files. This slight deviation is acceptable based on context.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data  
  Sample todo data is defined in the todoModel tests and used appropriately across tests to simulate various scenarios.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented  
  The app.test.tsx includes tests for the Router, using mocks to simulate router behavior and verifying that routes ("/", "/active", "/completed") are set up properly.
