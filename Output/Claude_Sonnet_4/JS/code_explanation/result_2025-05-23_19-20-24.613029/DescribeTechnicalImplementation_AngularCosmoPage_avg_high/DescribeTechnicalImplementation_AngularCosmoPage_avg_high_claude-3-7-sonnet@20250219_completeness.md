- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the documentation includes explanation of error handling and user notifications
  
  While the documentation mentions error callbacks in the sample code and refers to "Error Messaging" in the Accessibility Features section, it lacks comprehensive details about specific error handling strategies, error types, and how notifications are displayed to users.

  While the documentation mentions "extras" in the Page Factory Properties table as "Additional page metadata" with type "Array", it doesn't provide detailed information about how these extras are structured, added, edited, or used in the system. There's no code example or further explanation demonstrating how to work with these extras, what kinds of metadata can be stored, or how they're presented in the UI.

It lacks details about specific event names, payloads, and handling patterns across the application.
