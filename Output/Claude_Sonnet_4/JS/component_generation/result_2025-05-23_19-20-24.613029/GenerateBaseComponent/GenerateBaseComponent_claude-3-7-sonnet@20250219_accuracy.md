# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x
  
  The component uses modern React features and hooks that are compatible with React 18.x. Imports include `useState`, `useRef`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, and `useMemo`, which are all available in React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
  
  The code uses TypeScript thoroughly with proper interfaces (`SelectOption`, `SearchableSelectProps`), type annotations (`React.FC<SearchableSelectProps>`), generic type parameters for hooks (e.g., `useRef<HTMLDivElement>`), and proper typing for function parameters and returns.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling
  
  The component imports './index.css' and includes a complete CSS implementation with appropriate styling for all component states.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments
  
  The code is well-structured, clean, and doesn't contain any TODO comments or debug statements. It follows a professional coding style and organization.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility
  
  The component uses appropriate React state hooks:
  - `isOpen` state to manage dropdown visibility
  - `searchTerm` state for the search input
  - `focusedIndex` state for keyboard navigation
  - External state is handled via props (`value`) and callbacks (`onChange`)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props
  
  The component accepts a comprehensive set of customizable props:
  - `options` for select options
  - `value` for controlled component behavior
  - `placeholder` and `searchPlaceholder` for customizing text
  - `disabled` to disable the component
  - `className` for custom styling
  - Various callback functions and ARIA props for flexibility

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection
  
  The component implements comprehensive keyboard navigation:
  - Arrow keys for navigating options
  - Enter for selection/opening
  - Escape for closing the dropdown
  - Tab for accessibility
  - Different key handlers for different component states (trigger, search, list)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions
  
  The component properly uses refs for DOM interactions:
  - `containerRef` for click-outside detection
  - `triggerRef`, `searchInputRef`, `listboxRef` for focus management
  - Uses refs appropriately and avoids direct DOM manipulation except where necessary

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques
  
  The component demonstrates excellent focus management:
  - Focuses search input when dropdown opens
  - Returns focus to trigger when dropdown closes
  - Manages focus when navigating with keyboard
  - Tracks and visually indicates focused items
  - Uses `scrollIntoView` to ensure focused items are visible

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
  
  The component includes comprehensive ARIA attributes:
  - `aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded` for the trigger
  - `aria-controls` to associate trigger with dropdown
  - `aria-label`, `aria-describedby` for descriptions
  - `role="listbox"` and `role="option"` for proper semantics
  - `aria-selected` and `aria-disabled` for option states

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  The code appears well-structured to avoid common React errors. However, without runtime testing, I cannot be 100% certain that no console errors would occur in edge cases.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component
  
  The component uses React performance optimizations:
  - `useMemo` for derived state (selectedOption, filteredOptions)
  - `useCallback` for event handlers
  - Proper dependency arrays in hooks
  
  While these optimizations should prevent unnecessary re-renders, a complete performance analysis would require runtime testing.
