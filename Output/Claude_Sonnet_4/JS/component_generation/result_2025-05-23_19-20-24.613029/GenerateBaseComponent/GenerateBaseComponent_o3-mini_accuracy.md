# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  The code makes use of modern React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, etc.) which are standard since React 16.8. Although no explicit React 18 APIs or version declarations are present, the overall style is consistent with React 18 usage. The evaluation is 90% confident because the version isnâ€™t explicitly declared.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  The file extensions (.tsx) and the clearly defined interfaces (SearchableSelectProps, SelectOption) confirm a proper TypeScript implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  An index.css file is provided which covers the styling aspects of the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  The sources are free from any TODO comments and appear ready for production use.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  States such as isOpen, searchTerm, and focusedIndex are managed using useState, ensuring proper control over component behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  The component accepts a variety of props (options, placeholder, searchPlaceholder, disabled, className, etc.) through well-defined TypeScript interfaces, ensuring reusability.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  The component includes specific keydown handlers on the trigger button, search input, and listbox to handle Enter, Escape, Arrow keys, and Tab, which covers extensive keyboard navigation for selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  The component leverages React refs (containerRef, triggerRef, searchInputRef, listboxRef) appropriately to manage DOM interactions, such as focusing and detecting clicks outside of the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  Focus is correctly managed when opening the dropdown, switching focus to the search input, scrolling the focused option into view, and returning focus to the trigger after closing, which confirms proper focus management.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  ARIA attributes such as aria-haspopup, aria-expanded, aria-controls, aria-label, aria-describedby, and role attributes are implemented properly to enhance accessibility.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  A static analysis of the code shows no obvious sources of runtime errors or warnings. However, without executing the code, it is assumed to be clean, hence a 90% confidence level.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  The usage of useMemo and useCallback for memoization and function caching helps mitigate unnecessary re-renders. Although static review looks promising, dynamic runtime testing would further guarantee the optimization. Hence, a 95% confidence level.
