# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component renders a button that acts as a trigger and, when active, displays a dropdown container with a list of options.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  The component provides an input element inside the dropdown (within the .searchable-select__search-container) for real-time searching.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The code supports single item selection through the onChange callback, updating the selected value upon clicking an option or pressing Enter.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The implementation handles ArrowDown and ArrowUp keys in both the trigger and the list, allowing navigation of options via the keyboard.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  The keyboard handlers for both the search input and the list detect the Enter key and select the currently focused option appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  The triggerâ€™s onKeyDown event listens for the Enter key to open the dropdown if it is not already open.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  After an item is selected or the dropdown is closed with the Escape key, focus is programmatically returned to the trigger element via triggerRef.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  Clicking an option invokes the handleOptionSelect function which sets isOpen to false, thus closing the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  Pressing Enter on a focused option calls handleOptionSelect, which also closes the dropdown and resets the search and focus state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  The implemented key handlers in both the trigger and the dropdown correctly respond to the Escape key by closing the dropdown and resetting states.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  A useEffect hook sets up an event listener for clicks outside the component, executing closeDropdown accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  The handleTriggerKeyDown function listens for the Enter key while the trigger is focused, opening the dropdown if it is not open.
