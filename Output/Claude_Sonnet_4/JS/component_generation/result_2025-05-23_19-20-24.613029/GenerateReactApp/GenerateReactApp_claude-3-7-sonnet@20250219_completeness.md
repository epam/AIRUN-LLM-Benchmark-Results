# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The application fetches characters from the SWAPI API via the `fetchCharacters` function in `src/services/api.ts` and displays them in a list using the `CharacterList` component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  A `LoadingSpinner` component is implemented and displayed when the `loading` state is true in the `App` component. The spinner includes both a rotating animation and a "Loading characters..." text.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The `CharacterList` component maps over all characters in the `characters` array and renders each one as a list item, ensuring all fetched characters are displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  The application does not implement any search functionality or user input fields. It simply displays the fetched characters without any filtering capabilities.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character is displayed with its name property in the `CharacterList` component:
  ```tsx
  {characters.map((character) => (
    <li key={character.url} className="character-item">
      {character.name}
    </li>
  ))}
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The project structure, dependencies in `package.json`, and configuration files are consistent with a Create React App setup. The package.json includes standard CRA dependencies like `react-scripts`, and the file structure follows CRA conventions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The application uses the `useCharacters` custom hook to manage three different states:
  ```typescript
  const [characters, setCharacters] = useState<Character[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);
  ```
  These states are properly managed during the data fetching process.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each character list item uses the character's URL as a unique key:
  ```tsx
  <li key={character.url} className="character-item">
  ```
  This provides a reliable unique identifier for each list item.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  While the application has proper loading and error states, there's no explicit handling for an empty data state (when `characters.length === 0` but there's no error). However, if the API returns an empty array, the list would simply display without items, which is an acceptable behavior for this requirement.
