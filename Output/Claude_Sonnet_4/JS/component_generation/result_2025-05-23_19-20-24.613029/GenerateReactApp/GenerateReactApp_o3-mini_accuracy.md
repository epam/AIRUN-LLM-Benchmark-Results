# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses React 18.x or newer by checking the package.json dependencies.  
  The package.json lists "react": "^18.2.0" and "react-dom": "^18.2.0", confirming that React 18.x is used.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that TypeScript is properly implemented with appropriate type definitions for all components, props, and states.  
  The project uses TypeScript (.tsx) files, defines interfaces (e.g., Character, SwapiResponse), and provides type annotations for props and state in components and hooks, indicating proper usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Axios is used for API requests to fetch data from the Star Wars API endpoint.  
  The file src/services/api.ts makes use of Axios to perform an HTTP GET request to the SWAPI endpoint.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles API errors gracefully with appropriate error states or messages.  
  The custom hook (useCharacters) includes a try/catch block where failure to fetch characters sets an error state with a user-friendly error message.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the character data is fetched on component mount using useEffect hook.  
  The useCharacters hook uses useEffect to trigger the data fetching function upon component mount, ensuring the data is fetched at the right time.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application properly manages component rendering optimization.  
  The CharacterList component is wrapped with React.memo, which helps prevent unnecessary re-renders, indicating a proper optimization strategy.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows React best practices using hooks appropriately.  
  The app follows best practices by separating concerns through custom hooks (for fetching data), functional components, and proper error/loading management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't contain any TODO comments or unnecessary code.  
  The code provided is clean, concise, and does not contain any extraneous TODO comments or unused code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the codebase has minimal comments that only clarify complex logic when necessary.  
  Comments and documentation in the code are minimal and focused only on necessary clarifications, particularly in the API service and hook implementations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the API endpoint 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' is being called correctly.  
  The API_BASE_URL is set to 'https://swapi.dev/api' and the fetchCharacters function correctly appends "/people", forming the correct endpoint.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application renders without console errors or warnings.  
  Based on the provided code and adherence to standard practices (with React.StrictMode in index.tsx), it is highly likely that the application renders without console errors or warnings. However, without executing the code, there is a slight uncertainty.
