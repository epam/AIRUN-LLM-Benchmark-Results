# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The application fetches data using the custom hook (useCharacters) and passes the characters list to the CharacterList component, which renders the character names.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The code properly checks for the loading state and, if true, renders the LoadingSpinner component during API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  Every character fetched is mapped over in the CharacterList component, with each characterâ€™s name rendered in a list item.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  There are no elements in the code that handle user search input. The application only fetches and displays the data.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each list item in the CharacterList component displays the character name, as seen where {character.name} is rendered.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The package.json and file structure indicate the use of Create React App, along with react-scripts and a typical CRA setup.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The custom hook (useCharacters) manages states for characters, loading, and error, and the App component responds appropriately according to those states.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  The CharacterList component assigns a unique key to each item using character.url, ensuring optimal rendering.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  The component renders an empty list when there are no characters. However, while it functions correctly by displaying an empty list, it does not provide an explicit "no data" message. This behavior is acceptable though a more informative UI element could be added.  
  (Confidence less than 100% because some might consider an explicit empty state message as part of handling empty data states.)
