# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type  
  The SearchInput component uses a memoized onChange handler (handleInputChange) that calls the provided onChange prop, and the parent CharacterList updates its state accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls  
  The custom useDebounce hook is implemented with a 500ms delay, which fits within the recommended 300-500ms range, ensuring that API calls are not made excessively.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured  
  Axios is imported and used in the fetchCharacters function to call the SWAPI endpoint. The axios.get<ApiResponse>(url) call is correctly typed, and error handling is in place.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses  
  All components, props, and API responses are strongly typed via interfaces (e.g., Character, ApiResponse, SearchInputProps) and TypeScript generics, ensuring type safety throughout the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters  
  The endpoint is conditionally constructed: if a search term is provided, it uses `https://swapi.dev/api/people/?search=${encodeURIComponent(search)}`; otherwise, it fetches the standard people endpoint.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate  
  The code uses useCallback for memoizing the fetchCharacters and handleSearchChange functions, as well as useMemo to memoize the filteredCharacters, which is effective for performance improvements.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback  
  The API call in fetchCharacters is wrapped in a try-catch block, and both API errors and unexpected errors are caught. An error message is displayed to the user along with a retry button, and an ErrorBoundary component is implemented for handling unforeseen errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing  
  The useDebounce hook ensures that the fetchCharacters function is called only after the user has stopped typing for 500ms, preventing immediate API calls on every keystroke.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices  
  The useState hook is used for managing searchTerm and characters, while useEffect hooks are utilized to trigger data fetching appropriately. The state variables are updated and managed consistently with React best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code  
  The code is clean, with no commented-out sections or unused imports, and it adheres to a clear and maintainable structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the loading state is properly managed during API requests  
  Loading and searching states (loading and isSearching) are correctly managed to give visual feedback. The UI renders a LoadingSpinner when either state is active, ensuring a smooth user experience.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns  
  The implementation uses functional components with hooks, React.memo, and proper error boundaries, all of which are consistent with React 18.x recommended practices.
