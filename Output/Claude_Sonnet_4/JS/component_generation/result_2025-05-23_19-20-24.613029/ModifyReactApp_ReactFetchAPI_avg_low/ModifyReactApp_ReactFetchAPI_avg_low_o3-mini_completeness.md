# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The code includes a well-defined SearchInput component with an input field that triggers updates via an onChange event, effectively filtering characters based on name.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  The implementation utilizes a LoadingSpinner component and manages loading states (using both loading and isSearching flags) to display a loading indicator during API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  The useEffect hook calls fetchCharacters() on component mount initiating data loading with an empty search parameter, thereby ensuring initial data load.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  The code employs a debounced search mechanism (using useDebounce) and calls fetchCharacters with the debounced search term, establishing dynamic updates of search results as the user types.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  When the filtered character list is empty and thereâ€™s a non-empty search query, the NoResults component is rendered to inform the user appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The accompanying CSS contains responsive media queries adjusting layouts and font sizes for various screen widths, demonstrating a responsive design for the search component and overall UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  The code conditionally renders a list of characters (<ul> with CharacterItem components) when valid results are returned from the API, ensuring that search results are correctly displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  An ErrorBoundary component is provided to catch and render fallback UI in case of runtime errors, fulfilling the requirement for error handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The code defines interfaces such as Character, ApiResponse, and SearchInputProps, among others, ensuring full TypeScript coverage for API responses and component properties.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The implementation preserves the initial data loading behavior and overall functionality of the application while integrating enhanced search features, debouncing, and error handling.
