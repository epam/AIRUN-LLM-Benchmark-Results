# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass** (100%): The documentation identifies all major components. It mentions the REST factory, Page factory, PageController (as pageCtrl), and the User Factory (which serves the same role as the expected Users factory).

2. **Pass** (100%): The documentation explains the purpose of the REST factory by labeling it as the API layer and describing its role in RESTful communication for server interactions.

3. **Pass** (100%): The documentation describes the API endpoints in the CRUD Operations section (e.g., POST to /api/content/, GET, PUT, DELETE) which can be inferred as those used by the REST factory.

4. **Pass** (100%): The documentation explains the Page factory and explicitly states its role as a global state container for page data in the data flow pattern.

5. **Pass** (100%): The documentation describes the User Factory (serving the function of a Users factory) and explains that it stores current user context for managing user data.

6. **Pass** (90%): The documentation mentions the PageController (noted as pageCtrl) and labels it as handling business logic. Although its detailed responsibilities are not deeply elaborated, its inclusion in the architecture diagram and related workflows is sufficient.  
   Explanation: A more in-depth explanation of responsibilities could improve clarity.

7. **Pass** (100%): The local storage mechanism is clearly described. It is mentioned in the data flow pattern and data management sections as part of the draft recovery and backup process for unsaved changes.

8. **Pass** (100%): The version comparison functionality is explained in the "Existing Page Editing" workflow, noting the option to compare and recover unsaved or previous versions.

9. **Pass** (100%): The page creation workflow is detailed step-by-step in the "New Page Creation" section.

10. **Pass** (100%): The documentation explains the page editing workflow in detail, outlining steps from loading page data, detecting unsaved changes, to editing content with real-time validation.

11. **Pass** (90%): The page duplication feature is mentioned as a primary action in the Action Bar.  
    Explanation: While the duplication action is noted, additional detail on its process would bring greater clarity.

12. **Pass** (100%): The page deletion process is well documented. It is described both in the Action Bar (with a two-step confirmation) and in the CRUD operations (with mention of cascade deletion).

13. **Pass** (100%): The auto-URL generation feature is clearly described in the page creation workflow, where entering a title auto-generates a URL.

14. **Pass** (100%): Tag management and autocompletion are thoroughly explained, with explicit mention in both the core functionality section and within user workflows.

15. **Pass** (100%): The documentation describes the publication status options (publish, draft, schedule) in both the core functionality and the detailed user interface controls.

16. **Pass** (100%): Scheduled content publishing is explained, with details about scheduling interfaces and the workflow for future publishing.

17. **Pass** (100%): Page revision management is covered. The documentation discusses content versioning, revision tracking, and even has CRUD operations for revisions.

18. **Pass** (100%): The handling of page extras and additional data is explained in the CRUD operations section with specific endpoints and in performance considerations.

19. **Pass** (90%): Form validation mechanisms are mentioned in the context of real-time validation during page editing.  
    Explanation: Although briefly mentioned, further detail on the mechanisms would provide a more complete picture.

20. **Pass** (100%): Error handling during API operations is addressed with mention of graceful degradation and user notifications.

21. **Pass** (90%): Notification messaging for user feedback is touched upon under error handling with the note about user notifications.  
    Explanation: More detailed examples of how notifications are managed could improve the documentation.

22. **Pass** (100%): The theme-specific page types feature is clearly explained with references to theme integration and a page type selection interface.

24. **Fail** (100%): The documentation does not explicitly explain URL validation and the associated error handling. Although URL uniqueness is listed as a business rule, there is no detailed discussion of the validation process itself or its error handling.

25. **Pass** (100%): The tag suggestion system based on user input is described via the autocomplete functionality mentioned in the tag management sections.
