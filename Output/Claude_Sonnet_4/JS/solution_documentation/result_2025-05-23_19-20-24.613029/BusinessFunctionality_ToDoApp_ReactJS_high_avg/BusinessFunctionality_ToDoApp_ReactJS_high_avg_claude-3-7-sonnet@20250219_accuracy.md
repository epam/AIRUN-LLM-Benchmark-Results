# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document identifies the application as a Todo list management application
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the component structure (TodoApp, TodoItem, TodoFooter)
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of local storage for data persistence
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the state management approach using the TodoModel
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the routing mechanism for filtering todos
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the event handling for user interactions
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of immutable data structures for state management
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the performance optimization using shouldComponentUpdate
- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of the Utils class for helper functions

    While the document does reference the Utils class in the code snippet showing immutable state updates (`Utils.extend({}, todo, {completed: !todo.completed})`), it doesn't provide a dedicated explanation of the Utils class and its full range of helper functions. However, it does demonstrate its use for extending objects in an immutable way.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the data flow between components
