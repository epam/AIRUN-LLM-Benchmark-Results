- **Fail** (90%): Ensure the document covers the pluralization of item/items text based on count

    The document doesn't explicitly mention the pluralization of "item/items" text based on the count of remaining todos. While it does mention "TodoFooter (Navigation and statistics)" and refers to "Visual State Indicators" and "UI/UX Patterns", it doesn't specifically address how the text displays "item" (singular) or "items" (plural) depending on the number of remaining todos. This is a common feature in TodoMVC implementations where the footer shows "1 item left" or "n items left" accordingly.
