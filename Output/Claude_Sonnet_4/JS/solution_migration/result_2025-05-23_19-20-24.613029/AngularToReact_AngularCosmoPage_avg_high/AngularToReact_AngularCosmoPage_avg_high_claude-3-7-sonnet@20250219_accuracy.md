# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props
  
  The code consistently uses TypeScript throughout, with proper type definitions for all components, functions, props, and state. For example, interfaces like `PageFormProps`, `ButtonProps`, and `InputProps` are defined for component props, and types like `Page`, `PageFormData`, and `User` are defined for data models.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management
  
  The code properly implements Redux Toolkit with createSlice for state management. This is evident in the implementation of slices like `pageSlice` and `userSlice`, which use the `createSlice` function from '@reduxjs/toolkit'.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components
  
  All components in the code are implemented as functional components using the React.FC type. Examples include `PageEditor`, `PageForm`, `Button`, `Input`, and `Select`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately
  
  The code makes appropriate use of React hooks. For example, `useEffect` is used for side effects like initializing form data, `useCallback` is used for memoizing functions like `handleTitleChange` and `savePage`, and `useState` is used for local state management in components like `PageForm`.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource
  
  The code uses RTK Query (from Redux Toolkit) for API communication, which is a more modern approach than Angular's $resource. This is implemented in the `restApi.ts` file with endpoints for content management.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components
  
  Form handling is implemented using controlled components throughout the application. For example, in the `PageForm` component, form elements like inputs and selects have their values bound to state and update through onChange handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation
  
  React Router is properly implemented for navigation, with hooks like `useParams`, `useNavigate`, and `useLocation` used appropriately. The `App.tsx` file shows route definitions using the `Routes` and `Route` components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization
  
  The code uses react-i18next for internationalization. This is visible in the `i18n/index.ts` file setup and the use of the `useTranslation` hook in components like `PageEditor` and `PageForm`.

- **Fail** (95%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization
  
  While the code is well-organized with a modular structure that would facilitate code splitting, there's no explicit implementation of dynamic imports or React.lazy for code splitting. The file structure is appropriate for code splitting, but the implementation details are missing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations
  
  The codebase makes appropriate use of memoization for expensive operations. While React.memo is not explicitly used for component memoization, useCallback is extensively used for function memoization which helps prevent unnecessary renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks
  
  All useEffect, useCallback, and useMemo hooks have properly defined dependency arrays. For example, the useEffect hook for checking for newer versions has a comprehensive dependency array including all relevant state variables.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models
  
  The code defines comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all data models, including `Page`, `PageFormData`, `User`, `ApiResponse`, and others in the types directory.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state
  
  Redux selectors are used appropriately for accessing state, as seen in the `PageEditor` component where useSelector is used to extract state from the Redux store: `const { currentPage, formData, newerVersion, autoURL } = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.page)`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations
  
  Proper action creators are implemented for state mutations using the createSlice API from Redux Toolkit. Actions like `setCurrentPage`, `updateFormData`, and `resetForm` are defined and used throughout the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks
  
  Local storage functionality is implemented using custom hooks like `useLocalStorage`, which provides a clean API for reading from and writing to localStorage, complete with error handling.
