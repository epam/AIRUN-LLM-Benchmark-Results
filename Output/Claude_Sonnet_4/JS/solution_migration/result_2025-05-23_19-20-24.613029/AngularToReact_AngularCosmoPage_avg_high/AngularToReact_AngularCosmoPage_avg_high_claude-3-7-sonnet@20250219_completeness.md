# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented

    The code clearly implements these core functionalities in the PageEditor component. The savePage function handles create and update operations with a duplicate parameter to handle duplication. The deletePage function handles page deletion.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present

    Page type selection is implemented in the PageForm component with a Select component that uses formData.themePages for options. The onTypeChange handler updates the selected type.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists

    The handleTitleChange function includes auto-URL generation logic that converts the title to a URL-friendly format. It also uses the autoURL state to determine whether to automatically update the URL when the title changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented

    Tag management with autocomplete is implemented in the PageForm component. The component tracks tag input, fetches suggestions with useGetContentTagsQuery, displays them, and provides functionality to select suggestions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available

    The PageForm component includes radio inputs for all three publish options: 'Y' (publish), 'N' (draft), and 'schedule' with corresponding labels.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented

    When the 'schedule' option is selected, the code displays a datetime-local input. The handleScheduleDateChange function processes date changes, and publishing logic in the savePage function properly handles scheduled dates.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present

    The code implements localStorage functionality through useLocalStorage hook and provides restoreLocalVersion and deleteNewerVersion functions to manage newer versions. The useEffect hook checks for newer versions in local storage.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented

    A notification system is implemented through the useNotification hook with notify and notifyTranslated functions. These are used throughout the code to display success and error messages.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present

    The savePage function includes validation checks for the URL and page type before proceeding with the save operation, showing appropriate error notifications when validation fails.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled

    The code uses RTK Query to define a comprehensive set of API endpoints in restApi.ts covering content, content tags, content extras, content revisions, and content revision extras with appropriate CRUD operations for each.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented

    The code handles extras management in the savePage function, using createContentExtra, deleteContentExtras, createContentRevisionExtra, and deleteContentRevisionExtras hooks to manage extras for both pages and revisions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained

    Revision functionality is maintained through the createContentRevision API hook, which is called in the savePage function to create a new revision when saving changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components

    The code is well-organized into feature folders: components (UI and Page), store (slices and API), hooks, types, and utils. Business logic is primarily in the store and hooks, while UI is in the components folder.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved

    Translation is implemented using react-i18next with proper i18n setup. The useTranslation hook provides the t function used throughout the components to translate UI text.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters

    The URL structure is maintained with routes for "/new" and "/:url" in the App component using React Router, matching the original application's URL pattern.
