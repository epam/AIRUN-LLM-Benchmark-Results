# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props  
  All components, slices, hooks, and utility files include TypeScript interfaces and type annotations ensuring strict typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management  
  The code utilizes Redux Toolkitâ€™s createSlice (e.g., pageSlice, userSlice) and configureStore for managing global state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components  
  Every component (PageEditor, PageForm, UI components) is implemented as a functional component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately  
  React hooks are properly applied throughout the code to manage state, side effects, and memoization.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource  
  The API service is implemented using RTK Query with fetchBaseQuery, which is based on the Fetch API.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components  
  Form components (e.g., PageForm) use controlled inputs (with state handlers and value props) to manage form data.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation  
  React Router is used through BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route to define navigation paths.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization  
  The application integrates i18next with react-i18next for handling internationalization.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization  
  There is no evidence of explicit code splitting (e.g., usage of React.lazy and Suspense) to load components or routes dynamically.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations  
  The code does not utilize React.memo (or similar optimization techniques) to memoize components that may benefit from it.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks  
  The useEffect and useCallback hooks include appropriate dependency arrays, ensuring proper re-execution as needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models  
  All data models (Page, PageFormData, User, ApiResponse, etc.) have well-defined TypeScript interfaces.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state  
  The code uses useSelector to access state sections from the Redux store correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations  
  Action creators from createSlice (e.g., setCurrentPage, updateFormData) are defined and used to manage state mutations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks  
  A custom hook, useLocalStorage, is implemented to handle local storage operations properly.
