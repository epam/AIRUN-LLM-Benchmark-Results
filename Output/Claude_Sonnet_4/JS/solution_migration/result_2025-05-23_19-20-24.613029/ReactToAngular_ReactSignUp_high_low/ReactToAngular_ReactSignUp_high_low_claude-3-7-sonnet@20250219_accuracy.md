# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling
  
  The component clearly imports `FormBuilder`, `FormGroup`, `Validators`, and other reactive forms components from '@angular/forms'. The form is initialized with `this.fb.group()` in the `createForm()` method, and all form controls are properly configured with formControlName directives in the template.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)
  
  The form validation is correctly implemented in the `createForm()` method with appropriate validators:
  - Name: `Validators.required`, `Validators.minLength(3)`, `Validators.maxLength(60)`
  - Email: `Validators.required`, `Validators.email`
  - Password: `Validators.required`, `Validators.minLength(6)`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use
  
  The component implements async validation in the `setupAsyncValidation()` method, which sets up subscriptions to the value changes of the name and email fields. It uses `debounceTime`, `switchMap`, and calls the API service methods `isName()` and `isEmail()` to check if the name and email are already in use.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched
  
  The component uses a custom FormGroupComponent that applies CSS classes for feedback styling. The `bsStyle` getter in the FormGroupComponent returns 'success' or 'error' based on the field's valid state, and corresponding CSS classes are applied to display visual feedback.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions
  
  The `onSubmit()` method checks form validity, sets submitting to true, extracts form values, and calls the API service's `signup()` method. On success, it dispatches the `AuthActions.signupComplete` action with the user data.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails
  
  The `getFieldError()` method generates appropriate error messages for each validation error type. In the template, these messages are passed to the FormGroupComponent, which displays them in a help-block element when validation fails.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service
  
  The component imports the Title service from '@angular/platform-browser' and sets the page title in the `ngOnInit()` method using the `getTitle()` utility function: `this.titleService.setTitle(getTitle('Signup'));`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management
  
  The component imports `Store` from '@ngrx/store' and `AuthActions` from the store. It uses the store to dispatch actions upon successful signup: `this.store.dispatch(AuthActions.signupComplete({ user: result.data }));`

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress
  
  The submit button has a `[disabled]` attribute bound to the expression `submitting || signupForm.invalid`, which disables the button during submission or when the form is invalid.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses
  
  The `onSubmit()` method subscribes to the API call and uses the `next` and `error` callbacks to handle success and error responses. On error, it calls `handleSubmitError()` to set appropriate form errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management
  
  The component implements OnInit and OnDestroy interfaces, properly initializes in ngOnInit, and cleans up subscriptions in ngOnDestroy using a Subject: `this.destroy$.next(); this.destroy$.complete();`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises
  
  The ApiService uses Angular's HttpClient for all API calls, returning Observables instead of Promises: `return this.http.get<{ data: boolean }>(`/api/check-name/${name}`);`

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements
  
  The `getFieldError()` method returns error messages that match the requirements, including specifics like "Name must be between 3 and 60 characters in length" and "Password must be at least 6 characters".
