# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The component uses FormBuilder and FormGroup properly, demonstrating Angular Reactive Forms.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The form configuration applies Validators for required fields, minlength, maxlength, and email pattern validation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  The async validation is implemented in the component via valueChanges on the 'name' and 'email' fields with API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The custom FormGroupComponent renders feedback based on the validation state, using classes to indicate success or error.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  The onSubmit() method calls the signup API and on success dispatches AuthActions.signupComplete, aligning with the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The getFieldError method generates specific error messages, and the template displays them below their corresponding fields.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  The component sets the title in ngOnInit using titleService.setTitle in conjunction with a helper function getTitle.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The component does correctly inject and use @ngrx/store to dispatch actions. However, there is no evidence of @ngrx/effects being used or integrated, which is part of the stated requirement. The absence of effects could be by design if handled in a separate module; however, as per the evaluation step, this is considered a failure.  
  (Reason: While the store is used, the explicit use of @ngrx/effects for handling side effects is not demonstrated in the provided code.)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button is disabled when this.submitting is true or the form is invalid, satisfying the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  The API call in onSubmit properly handles success (dispatching an action) and error cases (invoking error handling), meeting the requirement.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component implements OnInit and OnDestroy, unsubscribes from Observables via takeUntil, and organizes code logically. This demonstrates good Angular practices. (Slight subjectivity in "best practices" evaluation leads to 95% confidence.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The ApiService makes use of Angularâ€™s HttpClient for all API communications.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The error messages for required fields, minlength, maxlength, and format validations correspond to common UI expectations. Although the explicit requirements for error messages are not detailed, the messages provided are standard and adequate.  
  (Reason: There is a minor uncertainty about matching exact error texts from unspecified requirements, but overall the messages are appropriate.)
