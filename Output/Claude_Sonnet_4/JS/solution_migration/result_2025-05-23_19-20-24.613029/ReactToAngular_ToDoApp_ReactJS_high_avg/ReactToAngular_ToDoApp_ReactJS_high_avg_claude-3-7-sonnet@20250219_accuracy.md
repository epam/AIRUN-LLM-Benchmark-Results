# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The package.json clearly shows Angular 14.x dependencies with all core packages specified with version `^14.0.0`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
  
  NgRx store is properly implemented with `@ngrx/store` version `^14.0.0` in the package.json, and the implementation includes a proper store setup in the app.module.ts file.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
  
  The code includes proper implementation of @ngrx/effects with the TodoEffects class that handles localStorage persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
  
  The implementation includes comprehensive actions (todo.actions.ts), reducers (todo.reducer.ts), and selectors (todo.selectors.ts) with all required functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
  
  All components use the @Component decorator correctly, and @Input is used in the TodoItemComponent for passing the todo item.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators
  
  The TodoItemComponent correctly uses @ViewChild to access the edit input element, replacing React's ref approach.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
  
  The code correctly uses @Input() for property binding in the TodoItemComponent, but no @Output() EventEmitter is explicitly used. This might be because the communication is primarily handled through the NgRx store, reducing the need for direct parent-child communication.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
  
  The UtilsService is implemented for common utility functions, and the store effects handle data persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
  
  Dependency injection is correctly used throughout the application, with services and store being injected into components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
  
  The TodoItemComponent correctly uses OnPush change detection with `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
  
  Angular Router is implemented with proper routes in the app-routing.module.ts and used in the todo-footer component for navigation between filters.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code follows Angular style guidelines with appropriate file naming, organization, and component structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
  
  TypeScript interfaces and types are well-defined and used consistently throughout the application for Todo items and other data structures.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
  
  All React JSX has been converted to Angular template syntax with proper binding and event handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
  
  React event handlers have been replaced with Angular event bindings like (click), (change), (input), etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs
  
  There are no TODOs or unfinished parts in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules
  
  The code does not implement lazy loading for feature modules. All components are eagerly loaded in the AppModule. There's no evidence of feature modules with lazy loading setup using the loadChildren syntax.
