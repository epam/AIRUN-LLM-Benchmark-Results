# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items
  
  The code includes the proper components and implementation to display all todo items. The `TodoMainComponent` properly fetches and displays todo items through the `filteredTodos$` observable from the store, and uses NgFor to render each todo item.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented
  
  The `TodoHeaderComponent` implements the functionality to add new todo items with proper key event handling that dispatches the `addTodo` action to the store when the Enter key is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works
  
  The `TodoItemComponent` implements toggle functionality through the `onToggle()` method which dispatches the `toggleTodo` action to update the state of individual todo items.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented
  
  The `TodoItemComponent` implements editing functionality with double-click to edit, blur and Enter key to submit, and Escape key to cancel, properly dispatching the `updateTodo` action when changes are submitted.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented
  
  The `TodoItemComponent` includes a destroy button that calls the `onDestroy()` method, which dispatches the `deleteTodo` action to remove the todo item from the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented
  
  The `TodoMainComponent` includes the toggle-all checkbox that calls the `onToggleAll()` method, which dispatches the `toggleAllTodos` action to mark all todos as complete or incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works
  
  The application implements filtering through routing and a `TodoFilterGuard` which dispatches the `setFilter` action. The filter links are present in the `TodoFooterComponent` and the `selectFilteredTodos` selector correctly filters todos based on the active filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The `TodoFooterComponent` displays the count of active items through the `activeTodoCount$` observable and properly pluralizes the word "item" using the `getItemText()` method.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items
  
  The `TodoFooterComponent` includes a clear completed button that calls the `onClearCompleted()` method, which dispatches the `clearCompleted` action to remove all completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage
  
  The `TodoEffects` class implements effects that load todos from localStorage on application start and save todos to localStorage whenever the todo list changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation
  
  The routing configuration in `app-routing.module.ts` properly defines routes for '/', '/active', and '/completed' with the `useHash: true` option, maintaining the expected URL structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states
  
  The template in `TodoMainComponent` uses `*ngIf="(allTodos$ | async)?.length"` to conditionally display the main section only when there are todos, correctly handling the empty state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly
  
  The application properly handles input submissions in `TodoHeaderComponent` for adding new todos and in `TodoItemComponent` for editing todos, with appropriate event handling and input validation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships
  
  The component structure follows a clean hierarchy with `AppComponent` as the root, containing the header, main, and footer components, and with the todo items as children of the main component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved
  
  The migration has preserved all the business logic, including todo creation, completion, editing, filtering, persistence, and other features, implementing them appropriately in Angular and NgRx.
