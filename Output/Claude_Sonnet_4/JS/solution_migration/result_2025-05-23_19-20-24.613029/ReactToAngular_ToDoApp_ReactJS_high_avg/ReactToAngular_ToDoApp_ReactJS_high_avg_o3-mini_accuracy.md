# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The package.json and Angular module imports show Angular version "^14.0.0". This meets the criteria.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The code includes StoreModule.forRoot with a todo reducer, and actions, making use of @ngrx/store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  The provided code includes EffectsModule.forRoot and a TodoEffects class that handles side effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  The solution defines actions (e.g., addTodo, toggleTodo), a reducer (todo.reducer.ts), and selectors (todo.selectors.ts) which together form a complete NgRx store implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  Components make proper use of the @Component decorator. The TodoItemComponent, for instance, uses @Input to receive a todo. Although @Output isn’t explicitly used, the overall communication relies on NgRx actions, which is acceptable for this architecture.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  The TodoItemComponent uses @ViewChild to access the edit input instead of React refs.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  The components use @Input() correctly. However, the event handling is primarily managed by dispatching NgRx actions rather than by using @Output() and EventEmitter for parent-child communication. This alternative pattern is acceptable in the context of NgRx, though it deviates from traditional @Output usage. Hence, a slightly lower confidence level is noted.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  The UtilsService provides utility functions (UUID generation, pluralization, storage handling) and is correctly injected using Angular’s DI system.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  Constructors across components and services properly inject dependencies such as Store, UtilsService, and Actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  The TodoItemComponent uses the OnPush change detection strategy, which helps optimize performance.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  The AppRoutingModule configures routes with Angular Router, and a route guard (TodoFilterGuard) is implemented.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The file structure, naming conventions, and separation of concerns are consistent with Angular best practices. Minor improvements could be made, but overall the code adheres well to the style guide.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  Interfaces such as Todo and TodoState are defined and utilized across the codebase.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  The migration replaces JSX (from React) with Angular’s template syntax, using proper data binding and event handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  Event bindings such as (click), (input), and (keydown) are used in the Angular templates to replace React’s event handling methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  There are no leftover TODO comments in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  The provided routing module defines static routes and does not use lazy loading techniques (e.g., loadChildren) for feature modules. This is a missing feature based on the evaluation criteria.
