# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The TodoMainComponent uses an *ngFor directive on filteredTodos$ (obtained via a selector) to render each todo item, ensuring that all todos are displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoHeaderComponent includes an input that listens for the Enter key and dispatches the addTodo action to create a new todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  The TodoItemComponent implements an onToggle method that dispatches the toggleTodo action, allowing individual todos to be marked as complete or incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent contains methods (onEdit, onSubmit, onKeyDown) to start editing, update the title, or cancel edit, which dispatch appropriate actions such as updateTodo and setEditing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent includes an onDestroy method that dispatches deleteTodo, ensuring that a todo can be removed from the list.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  The TodoMainComponent has a checkbox with an onToggleAll handler that dispatches toggleAllTodos to update the state of all todo items at once.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  The routing configuration (with TodoFilterGuard) and selectors in the store allow the application to correctly filter the todos based on the route data (all, active, completed).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooterComponent uses the selectActiveTodoCount selector and displays the count via an observable, making the active items count visible to the user.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The TodoFooterComponent includes a button that dispatches clearCompleted, and the reducer filters out completed todos when this action is received.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  NgRx Effects are set up to save todos to local storage using the saveTodos$ effect, and loadTodos$ restores them at startup via the loadTodos action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The AppRoutingModule defines routes for '', 'active', and 'completed' (with a catch-all redirect), ensuring the URL structure remains intuitive and similar to the original setup.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  The TodoMainComponent conditionally renders the main section only if there are todos (using *ngIf), and the TodoFooterComponent similarly checks data before rendering counts and buttons.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  The event handlers in TodoHeaderComponent (for adding todos) and in TodoItemComponent (for editing todos) manage events properly by preventing default behaviors and processing the input values.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The component architecture, with a clear separation between header, main, and footer embedded within AppComponent, demonstrates correct component relationships and data flow.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  The migration includes equivalent functionality for state handling (using NgRx actions, reducers, selectors, and effects), preserving the original TodoMVC business logic such as adding, updating, toggling, deleting, and filtering todo items.
