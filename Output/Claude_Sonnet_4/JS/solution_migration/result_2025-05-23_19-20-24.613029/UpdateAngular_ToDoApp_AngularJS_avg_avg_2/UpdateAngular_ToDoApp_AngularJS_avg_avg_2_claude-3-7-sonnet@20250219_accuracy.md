    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management
    
    NgRx store is correctly imported and configured in the app.module.ts:

    import { StoreModule } from '@ngrx/store';
    // ...
    StoreModule.forRoot({ todos: todoReducer }),
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects

    // ...
    EffectsModule.forRoot([TodoEffects]),
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management
    
    The code includes comprehensive actions, reducers, selectors, and effects specifically for todo management:
    - Actions in todo.actions.ts (loadTodos, addTodo, updateTodo, etc.)
    - Reducer in todo.reducer.ts
    - Selectors in todo.selectors.ts
    - Effects in todo.effects.ts

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator
    
    The TodoStorageService correctly uses the @Injectable decorator:
    ```typescript
    @Injectable({
      providedIn: 'root'
    })
    export class TodoStorageService {
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service
    
    The TodoStorageService properly implements localStorage for data persistence:
    ```typescript
    get(): Todo[] {
      const stored = localStorage.getItem(this.STORAGE_ID);
      return stored ? JSON.parse(stored) : [];
    }

    put(todos: Todo[]): void {
      localStorage.setItem(this.STORAGE_ID, JSON.stringify(todos));
    }
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators
    
    All component files correctly use the @Component decorator with selector, template, etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators
    
    Both TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective correctly use the @Directive decorator:
    ```typescript
    @Directive({
      selector: '[todoFocus]'
    })
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)
    
    The templates correctly use Angular syntax, for example in todo-list.component.ts:
    ```html
    <section class="main" *ngIf="(todos$ | async)?.length">
    ```
    And:
    ```html
    <app-todo-item 
      *ngFor="let todo of filteredTodos$ | async; trackBy: trackByFn" 
      [todo]="todo">
    </app-todo-item>
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))
    
    Event binding uses proper Angular syntax throughout, for example:
    ```html
    <button class="destroy" (click)="onDelete()"></button>
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])
    
    Property binding uses proper Angular syntax throughout, for example:
    ```html
    <li [class.completed]="todo.completed" [class.editing]="isEditing$ | async">
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed
    
    Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented, such as OnInit in AppComponent and OnChanges in TodoFocusDirective.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models
    
    TypeScript interfaces are correctly used for data models in todo.model.ts:
    ```typescript
    export interface Todo {
      id: string;
      title: string;
      completed: boolean;
    }

    export interface TodoState {
      todos: Todo[];
      filter: 'all' | 'active' | 'completed';
      editingTodo: Todo | null;
    }
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services
    
    Dependency injection is correctly implemented in component constructors:
    ```typescript
    constructor(
      private store: Store,
      private router: Router
    ) {}
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions
    
    The code follows Angular style guide conventions throughout, with proper naming, organization, and structure.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings
    
    There is an issue in the TodoItemComponent where the 'map' operator is used without being imported:
    ```typescript
    this.isEditing$ = this.store.select(selectEditingTodo).pipe(
      map(editingTodo => editingTodo?.id === this.todo?.id)
    );
    ```
    The 'map' operator should be imported from 'rxjs/operators'.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)
    
    The code makes appropriate use of TypeScript features, including interfaces, strong typing, and type safety.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code
    
    The code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design
    
    The components are properly divided by responsibility:
    - TodoHeaderComponent for adding new todos
    - TodoListComponent for displaying the list and toggle all functionality
    - TodoItemComponent for individual todo operations
    - TodoFooterComponent for filtering and clearing completed todos
