# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list
  
  The application has a `TodoListComponent` which is responsible for displaying the list of todos. This component is defined in `src/app/components/todo-list/todo-list.component.ts` and includes the todo list rendering logic with a template that correctly iterates over todo items.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos
  
  The application has a `TodoHeaderComponent` defined in `src/app/components/todo-header/todo-header.component.ts` which includes an input field for adding new todos along with the logic to handle form submission.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos
  
  The `TodoItemComponent` defined in `src/app/components/todo-item/todo-item.component.ts` includes functionality for editing existing todos. It supports double-clicking on a todo to enter edit mode and handles the editing flow.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos
  
  The `TodoFooterComponent` defined in `src/app/components/todo-footer/todo-footer.component.ts` includes the filter links (All, Active, Completed) that allow users to filter todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics
  
  The `TodoFooterComponent` displays count statistics by using the `selectRemainingCount` and `selectCompletedCount` selectors to show the number of items left and clear completed button when needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos
  
  The `TodoHeaderComponent` implements the functionality to add new todos through the `onAddTodo()` method, which dispatches the `addTodo` action with the new todo title.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos
  
  The `TodoItemComponent` implements functionality to edit existing todos through the `onStartEdit()`, `onFinishEdit()`, and `onCancelEdit()` methods, which use NgRx actions like `startEditing`, `updateTodo`, and `stopEditing`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos
  
  The `TodoItemComponent` includes an `onDelete()` method that dispatches the `deleteTodo` action to remove a todo item.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed
  
  The `TodoItemComponent` includes an `onToggle()` method that dispatches the `toggleTodo` action to mark a todo as completed or active.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The application implements filtering through:
  1. Router links in `TodoFooterComponent` for navigation
  2. The `selectFilteredTodos` selector in `todo.selectors.ts` that filters todos based on the current filter
  3. The `AppComponent` which updates the filter based on the navigation URL

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete
  
  The `TodoListComponent` implements this functionality through the `onToggleAll()` method which dispatches the `toggleAllTodos` action with the completed status.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos
  
  The `TodoFooterComponent` implements this functionality through the `onClearCompleted()` method which dispatches the `clearCompleted` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos
  
  The `TodoFooterComponent` displays the count of remaining todos using the `remainingCount$` observable that is connected to the `selectRemainingCount` selector.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage
  
  The `TodoStorageService` in `src/app/services/todo-storage.service.ts` implements localStorage persistence with `get()` and `put()` methods, and the NgRx effects ensure todos are saved after any relevant action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization
  
  The `AppComponent`'s `ngOnInit` method dispatches the `loadTodos` action, which triggers the `loadTodos$` effect in `TodoEffects` to load todos from localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing
  
  The application implements a custom directive `TodoEscapeDirective` that listens for the Escape key press and emits an event. The `TodoItemComponent` uses this directive with `(todoEscape)="onCancelEdit()"`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo
  
  The application implements a custom directive `TodoFocusDirective` that automatically focuses an element when its input property changes. The `TodoItemComponent` uses this with `[todoFocus]="isEditing$ | async"`.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original
  
  The application includes references to CSS files in the HTML template, and the component structure appears to maintain the same DOM structure as the original TodoMVC template. However, without seeing the actual CSS files or a visual comparison, I can't be 100% certain about the visual appearance.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately
  
  The application handles empty todo titles in multiple places:
  - In `TodoHeaderComponent.onAddTodo()`, it checks if the title is empty before adding
  - In `TodoItemComponent.onFinishEdit()`, it checks if the title is empty and deletes the todo if so

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter
  
  The application uses Angular Router with route definitions in `AppModule` for the different filter states, and the `TodoFooterComponent` includes router links to these routes. The filter state is updated based on the URL in the `AppComponent`.
