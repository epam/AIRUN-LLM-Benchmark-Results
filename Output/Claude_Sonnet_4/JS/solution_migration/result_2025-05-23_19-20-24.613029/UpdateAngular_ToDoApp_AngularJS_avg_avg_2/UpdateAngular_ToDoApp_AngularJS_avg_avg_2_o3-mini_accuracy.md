# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The package.json specifies Angular packages at version "^14.0.0". This clearly confirms the use of Angular 14.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
  The code uses modern ES module syntax with import/export statements, and there is no sign of RequireJS.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
  The application imports and configures StoreModule (e.g., StoreModule.forRoot({ todos: todoReducer })) from @ngrx/store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
  The code sets up EffectsModule.forRoot([TodoEffects]) and defines TodoEffects, confirming the use of @ngrx/effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
  The provided code includes well-structured actions in todo.actions.ts, state handling in todo.reducer.ts, selectors in todo.selectors.ts, and side effects managed by todo.effects.ts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
  The TodoStorageService is decorated with @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }), which follows the Angular dependency injection pattern.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
  The TodoStorageService explicitly uses localStorage.getItem and localStorage.setItem to persist todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
  All components (e.g., AppComponent, TodoHeaderComponent) are correctly decorated with @Component and include appropriate metadata such as selector and template.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
  The directives TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective are properly implemented with the @Directive decorator and include necessary logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
  Templates use structural directives such as *ngIf and *ngFor (e.g., in TodoListComponent and TodoFooterComponent), demonstrating proper Angular template syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
  The event bindings in templates for clicks (e.g., (click) on buttons) are correctly implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
  The code uses property binding for CSS classes (e.g., [class.completed], [todoFocus]) effectively in the component templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
  Angular lifecycle hooks like ngOnInit and ngOnChanges are employed in the AppComponent and TodoFocusDirective, respectively.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
  Interfaces for Todo and TodoState are defined in the models file, ensuring that TypeScript features are correctly utilized.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
  The constructors across components and services correctly inject required dependencies (e.g., Store, Router, TodoStorageService).

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The provided code is structured and split into modules, components, services, etc., according to best practices. There is a minor note regarding the initialization of the isEditing$ observable in TodoItemComponent, which depends on the @Input property “todo” that might not be available in the constructor. This usage is common but might require using ngOnChanges or another strategy for absolute clarity. Hence, confidence is slightly less than 100%.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
  Based on the code review, there are no obvious errors. However, runtime behavior (e.g., potential issues with lifecycle timing in TodoItemComponent) is not fully verifiable without executing the code. Therefore, the confidence level is lower.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
  The application makes proper use of TypeScript with clearly defined interfaces, types, and modern class features.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
  The sample contains no commented-out code blocks or unresolved TODO comments.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design  
  Each component, service, and directive has a distinct role and concern, following the single responsibility principle.
