# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed
  
  The `TodoHeader` component contains input handling logic that captures the Enter key press and calls `onAddTodo` with the input value, which dispatches the `addTodo` action to add a new todo to the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter
  
  The application uses the `selectFilteredTodos` selector to filter todos based on the current filter state, and renders them in the `TodoMain` component's `<ul className="todo-list">` element.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos
  
  This functionality is implemented in the `toggleAllTodos` reducer in the `todoSlice.ts` file and connected to the UI via the `onToggleAll` handler in `TodoMain`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted
  
  The `TodoItem` component provides handlers for toggling (`handleToggle`), editing (`handleEdit`), and deleting (`handleDestroy`) individual todos, which dispatch the appropriate actions to the Redux store.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode
  
  In the `TodoItem` component, the label has an `onDoubleClick` event handler that calls `handleEdit`, which sets the editing state for that specific todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo
  
  The `handleKeyDown` function in `TodoItem` checks for the Enter key press and calls `handleSubmit` to save the edited todo, dispatching the `updateTodo` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value
  
  The `handleKeyDown` function in `TodoItem` also checks for the Escape key press and resets the edit text to the original todo title, then calls `onCancel` to exit editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The `TodoFooter` component displays the count of active items with proper pluralization using the `activeCount` prop and the `pluralize` utility function.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The `TodoFooter` component includes filter buttons for All, Active, and Completed, which use React Router navigation to change routes and update the filter state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos
  
  The `TodoFooter` component includes a "Clear completed" button that calls `onClearCompleted` when clicked, which dispatches the `clearCompleted` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence
  
  The application uses a `storage` utility to save and retrieve todos from localStorage. Each reducer that modifies todos calls `storage.set(STORAGE_KEY, state.todos)` to persist changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state
  
  The application conditionally renders UI elements based on todo state, such as hiding the footer when no todos exist and showing/hiding the "Clear completed" button based on the presence of completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count
  
  The application uses a `pluralize` utility function to correctly display "item" or "items" based on the active count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components
  
  The application is well-structured with focused components: `TodoHeader`, `TodoMain`, `TodoItem`, and `TodoFooter`, each with a clear responsibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality
  
  The code is well-organized into logical directories: components, types, store, constants, utils, and hooks, following modern React application architecture best practices.
