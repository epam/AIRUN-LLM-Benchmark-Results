# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The TodoHeader component listens for the Enter key (using KEYS.ENTER) and, upon detecting it, calls onAddTodo with the trimmed input value.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The TodoMain component leverages the selectFilteredTodos selector, which returns the todos filtered based on the current filter state, ensuring the correct list is displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  The implementation in TodoMain renders a checkbox (with id "toggle-all") whose onChange event triggers the onToggleAll callback. This properly toggles all todos’ completed state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  The TodoItem component provides handlers for toggling (onToggle), editing (onEdit followed by onSave) and deleting (onDestroy) each todo item, confirming these functionalities are present.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  The TodoItem component attaches an onDoubleClick event handler to the label that invokes onEdit, which switches the item to editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  In the TodoItem component, the onKeyDown event handler listens for the Enter key. When pressed, it calls handleSubmit which either saves the changes or deletes the todo if the input becomes empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  The TodoItem component’s onKeyDown handler checks for KEYS.ESCAPE, and when pressed, resets the editText state to the original todo title and calls onCancel.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooter component displays the active count within a span element (className "todo-count"), showing the number of remaining active items.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The footer renders three buttons for the filter options and applies classNames to highlight the active filter. The onClick events are correctly wired to navigate to the appropriate routes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  The TodoFooter component conditionally renders a button with className "clear-completed" when there is at least one completed todo, and it is linked to the onClearCompleted handler.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  The storage utility abstracts localStorage get and set operations, and the todoSlice reducers call storage.set after any modifications, thus ensuring persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  Components such as TodoMain and TodoFooter conditionally render parts of the UI (e.g., returning null when there are no todos, or not displaying the footer when no todos exist), satisfying this condition.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  The pluralize utility function in the storage file is used in TodoFooter to append an “s” when the active count is not equal to 1, ensuring correct pluralization.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The code is organized into distinct functional components (TodoHeader, TodoMain, TodoItem, TodoFooter, and TodoApp) that each handle a specific aspect of the application, demonstrating sound component composition.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The project structure separates concerns into folders such as types, constants, utils, store, hooks, and components, which confirms that the code is well-organized by feature and functionality.
