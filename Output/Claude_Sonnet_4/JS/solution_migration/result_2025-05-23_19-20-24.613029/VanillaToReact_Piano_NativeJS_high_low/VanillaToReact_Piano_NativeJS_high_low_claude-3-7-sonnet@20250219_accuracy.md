# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration
  
  The code clearly demonstrates the use of React 18 with TypeScript by using the create-react-app template with TypeScript:
  ```bash
  npx create-react-app virtual-piano --template typescript
  ```
  Additionally, the index.tsx file shows the usage of ReactDOM.createRoot which is specific to React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure
  
  TypeScript interfaces are defined in the `src/types/piano.types.ts` file. This includes interfaces such as `AudioMap`, `PianoKeyData`, and type definitions like `Note`, `Letter`, and `DisplayMode`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks
  
  All components like Piano, PianoKey, Controls, Header, Footer, and FullscreenButton are implemented as functional components using the React.FC type annotation. They use React hooks like useState, useCallback, useEffect, etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)
  
  The code demonstrates proper use of state management through hooks like useState for displayMode and activeKeys, and custom hooks such as useAudio, useKeyboard, and useFullscreen, all of which use useEffect appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels
  
  Keyboard event handling is abstracted into a custom hook `useKeyboard` which manages keydown and keyup event listeners within appropriate useEffect cleanup. This is used in the Piano component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events
  
  The PianoKey component correctly implements mouse event handlers using React's synthetic events:
  ```typescript
  onMouseDown={handleMouseDown}
  onMouseUp={handleMouseUp}
  onMouseOut={handleMouseOut}
  onMouseMove={handleMouseMove}
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment
  
  Audio resources are managed in the useAudio custom hook which properly initializes, plays, and stops audio elements. The Audio objects are initialized with paths using process.env.PUBLIC_URL.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility
  
  Fullscreen functionality is encapsulated in a dedicated useFullscreen hook that properly handles the Fullscreen API with browser events and state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns
  
  Conditional class application is done using template literals and ternary operators, which is a standard React pattern:
  ```typescript
  const keyClasses = [
    styles.pianoKey,
    isSharp ? styles.sharp : '',
    isActive ? styles.active : '',
    isSharp && !note ? styles.none : '',
  ].filter(Boolean).join(' ');
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate
  
  React.memo is appropriately used on all components, such as PianoKey, Piano, Controls, Header, Footer, and FullscreenButton to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations
  
  Audio playback is handled with proper React lifecycle considerations. The useAudio hook implements useRef to maintain references to audio objects across renders, and useCallback to memoize functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application
  
  The code uses strict TypeScript typing throughout. This includes explicit type definitions for props, states, and function returns. TypeScript annotations are properly used for component props interfaces and custom type definitions.
