# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'
  
  The header component is properly implemented in `src/components/Header/Header.tsx` with the title "Virtual Piano" in an h1 element with the className "headerTitle".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons
  
  The Controls component in `src/components/Controls/Controls.tsx` includes two buttons labeled "Notes" and "Letters" within a container with the className "btnContainer".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)
  
  The Piano component in `src/components/Piano/Piano.tsx` correctly renders both white keys (PIANO_KEYS array with 7 natural notes) and black keys (SHARP_KEYS array with 5 sharps and one null for the gap).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes
  
  In the PianoKey component (`src/components/Piano/PianoKey.tsx`), each key element has data attributes for both letter and note: `data-letter={letter}` and `data-note={note}`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked
  
  The implementation includes a useAudio hook that properly initializes audio elements for all notes, and the playNote function is correctly called when keys are pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)
  
  The PianoKey component applies an "active" class when the key is pressed, and the CSS in PianoKey.module.css properly styles active keys with a different background color.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes
  
  The useKeyboard hook properly maps keyboard keys to piano notes and triggers the appropriate functions for keydown and keyup events.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked
  
  The Controls component correctly manages the display mode state and passes it to the Piano component, which then displays either notes or letters based on the mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes
  
  The FullscreenButton component uses the useFullscreen hook to toggle between fullscreen and normal display modes using the Fullscreen API.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly
  
  The implementation uses a Set for activeKeys in the Piano component, allowing for multiple simultaneous key presses without conflicts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys
  
  The Piano component includes a handleMouseMove function that checks if the mouse button is pressed and triggers the note accordingly, enabling drag functionality across keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information
  
  The Footer component in `src/components/Footer/Footer.tsx` correctly displays "2020" within a footer element.
