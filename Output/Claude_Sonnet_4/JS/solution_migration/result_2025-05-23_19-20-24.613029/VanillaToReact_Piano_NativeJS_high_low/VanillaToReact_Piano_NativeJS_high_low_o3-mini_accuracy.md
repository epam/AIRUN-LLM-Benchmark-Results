# Evaluation Report

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration  
  The application uses ReactDOM.createRoot (a React 18 method) and was bootstrapped with Create React App using the TypeScript template.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure  
  The code defines an AudioMap interface in the types file and uses strict typing in the audio management hook.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks  
  All components are defined as functional components (React.FC) and utilize React hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useCallback.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)  
  State management is appropriately handled in components (e.g., Piano and App components), using useState and useEffect to manage UI changes.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels  
  The useKeyboard hook installs document-level keydown and keyup event handlers, and these events propagate correctly to trigger audio actions.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events  
  The PianoKey component correctly implements React synthetic events (onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseOut, onMouseMove) to handle mouse interaction.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment  
  The useAudio hook loads audio files using HTMLAudioElement, manages playback, and controls repeated notes via the useRef hook.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility  
  The useFullscreen hook, along with its event listeners and state management, adheres to React standards while interfacing with the browserâ€™s fullscreen API.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns  
  Components such as PianoKey correctly apply conditional class names using arrays and the filter method, ensuring proper styling based on state.

- **Pass (100%))**: Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate  
  Components (e.g., Piano, PianoKey, Header, Controls, FullscreenButton, Footer) are wrapped with React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-rendering.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations  
  The audio playback is managed through well-defined lifecycle hooks (useEffect and useCallback) ensuring that audio resources are initialized and controlled correctly.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application  
  The entire codebase uses TypeScript interfaces and types consistently, ensuring type safety across components, hooks, and utility functions.
