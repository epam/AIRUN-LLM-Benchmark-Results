- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'  
  The Header component clearly renders an <h1> with "Virtual Piano" as its title.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons  
  The Controls component renders two buttons labeled "Notes" and "Letters", wrapped inside a container.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)  
  The Piano component maps over both PIANO_KEYS and SHARP_KEYS arrays to render all keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes  
  The PianoKey component sets "data-letter" and "data-note" attributes, enabling clear markup.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked  
  The useAudio hook defines a clear mapping between notes and their corresponding audio files, and the playNote function is correctly integrated on key events.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)  
  The PianoKey component applies the "active" CSS class based on the activeKeys state, which highlights keys appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes  
  The useKeyboard hook is implemented to listen for keydown/keyup events, triggering audio playback based on the mapped keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked  
  The Controls component toggles the display mode in the App component, and the PianoKey component adjusts its label display based on the selected mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes  
  The FullscreenButton component uses a custom useFullscreen hook to successfully enter and exit fullscreen mode upon clicking.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly  
  The state management in the Piano component (using a Set to track active keys) supports multiple keys being active, ensuring simultaneous inputs are handled correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys  
  The onMouseMove event in the PianoKey component, combined with checking event.buttons, ensures that dragging across keys triggers the appropriate key press behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information  
  The Footer component is implemented and displays "2020", fulfilling the footer content requirement.
