# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18.x
  
  The application clearly uses React 18 as evidenced by the import `import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';` in the src/index.tsx file, which is a React 18 feature. The package.json also specifies "react": "^18.2.0" and "react-dom": "^18.2.0".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript for type safety
  
  TypeScript is extensively used throughout the codebase. All files have .tsx or .ts extensions, and there are proper type annotations, interfaces (like Todo, FilterType, TodoState), and generics (React.FC with props interfaces).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for state management
  
  Redux Toolkit is properly implemented with createSlice in src/store/todoSlice.ts. The code imports createSlice from @reduxjs/toolkit and uses it to define reducers, actions, and selectors.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm nanoid is used for generating unique IDs
  
  Nanoid is imported and correctly used for generating unique IDs in the todoSlice.ts file:
  ```typescript
  import { nanoid } from 'nanoid';
  // ...
  const newTodo: Todo = {
    id: nanoid(),
    title: action.payload.trim(),
    completed: false,
  };
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code uses functional components with hooks instead of class components
  
  All components are functional components using React hooks such as useState, useEffect, useSelector, and useDispatch. There are no class components in the codebase.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains the same routing functionality with proper route handling
  
  The application uses a custom `useRouter` hook that handles hash-based routing (`#/all`, `#/active`, `#/completed`), maintaining the original TodoMVC routing functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Redux store is properly configured with appropriate slices
  
  The Redux store is properly configured in src/store/index.ts using configureStore from Redux Toolkit, with todoReducer registered as a slice.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the Redux provider is set up in the application entry point
  
  The Redux Provider component is correctly set up in App.tsx, wrapping the entire application:
  ```typescript
  <Provider store={store}>
    <div className="App">
      <TodoApp />
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  </Provider>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for all data structures
  
  Proper interfaces and types are defined in src/store/types.ts including Todo, FilterType, and TodoState. The code also defines proper prop interfaces for components and type definitions for the Redux store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows React best practices for component composition
  
  The application follows React best practices by breaking down the UI into small, reusable components (TodoHeader, TodoMain, TodoItem, TodoFooter, TodoFilters) with clear responsibilities and proper props passing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles keyboard events properly
  
  Keyboard events are properly handled:
  - Enter key (code 13) is used for creating todos in TodoHeader and finishing edits in TodoItem
  - Escape key (code 27) is used for canceling edits in TodoItem
  
  Both use the appropriate keyboard event handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application maintains local storage persistence if implemented
  
  Local storage persistence is properly implemented in src/utils/storage.ts with functions for loading and saving todos. The Redux actions call saveTodos when the state changes to persist to localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  No console.error or console.warn statements appear in the code, and there are no obvious issues that would cause runtime errors or warnings. Component structure follows React best practices to avoid common warnings.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify the application implements proper error handling
  
  The application includes try/catch blocks for localStorage operations. However, some potential error cases (like handling invalid todo items) could be more robustly handled, which is why this is rated at 95% confidence rather than 100%.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code is optimized with no unnecessary re-renders
  
  The code follows proper Redux patterns for selecting state with memoized selectors (selectTodos, selectFilteredTodos, etc.) and only renders components when necessary, avoiding unnecessary re-renders.
