# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos

    The application includes a `TodoHeader.tsx` component that renders an `h1` heading with "todos" text and an input field with a placeholder "What needs to be done?" for creating new todos. The input field has proper event handling for the Enter key to add new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos

    The `TodoMain.tsx` component includes a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and renders a list of todos using the `TodoItem` component. The toggle-all checkbox has proper functionality to mark all todos as complete or incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button

    The `TodoItem.tsx` component renders each todo with a toggle checkbox for marking completion status, a label displaying the todo title, and a delete button (with the class "destroy").

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode

    The `TodoItem.tsx` component implements double-click functionality on the label with the `onDoubleClick={handleEdit}` event handler, which sets the component to editing mode by updating the `isEditing` state, displaying an input field for editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)

    The application implements filtering through the `TodoFilters.tsx` component, which provides links for "All", "Active", and "Completed" filters. The Redux store manages the current filter state, and the `selectFilteredTodos` selector in `todoSlice.ts` filters todos accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization

    The `TodoFooter.tsx` component displays the count of active todos with proper pluralization using the `pluralize` utility function from `storage.ts` which correctly handles singular and plural forms.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter

    The `TodoFilters.tsx` component includes filter links that apply the "selected" class to the currently active filter link based on the `currentFilter` prop passed from the parent component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist

    The `TodoFooter.tsx` component conditionally renders a "Clear completed" button using `{completedTodoCount > 0 && (...)}` which only appears when there are completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter

    The `TodoHeader.tsx` component handles the Enter key press event in the `handleKeyUp` function, which dispatches the `addTodo` action when Enter is pressed and the input is not empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos

    The `TodoItem.tsx` component includes a checkbox with an `onChange={handleToggle}` event handler that dispatches the `toggleTodo` action to change the completion status of individual todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once

    The `TodoMain.tsx` component includes a toggle-all checkbox with an `onChange={handleToggleAll}` event handler that dispatches the `toggleAll` action to change the completion status of all todos at once.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management

    The `TodoItem.tsx` component implements editing functionality with proper focus management. It includes an input field with `autoFocus={isEditing}` to automatically focus when editing starts, and handles blur events to save changes or cancel editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos

    The `TodoItem.tsx` component includes a delete button with an `onClick={handleDestroy}` event handler that dispatches the `deleteTodo` action to remove individual todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos

    The `TodoFooter.tsx` component includes a "Clear completed" button with an `onClick={handleClearCompleted}` event handler that dispatches the `clearCompleted` action to remove all completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status

    The application correctly filters todos in the `selectFilteredTodos` selector of `todoSlice.ts`, which returns filtered todos based on the current filter state ('all', 'active', or 'completed'). The `useRouter` hook handles URL hash changes to update the filter.
