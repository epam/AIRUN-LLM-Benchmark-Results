- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states
  
  Tests for disabled options and states are present in `Select.menu.test.tsx` under "Option States" and in `Select.test.tsx` for testing the overall disabled state of the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance
  
  Performance testing for large option sets is explicitly included in `Select.performance.test.tsx` and also in `Select.edgecases.test.tsx` under "Performance Edge Cases", verifying that the component renders efficiently with large datasets.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested
  
  Focus management is tested across multiple files, including `Select.state.test.tsx` under "Focus Management" and in `Select.accessibility.test.tsx` for focus trapping and keyboard navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations
  
  While there isn't an explicit `formatOptionLabel` test, the test suite uses custom option structures and verifies option rendering in several places. The testing utilities include support for customizing option rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)
  
  Callback function testing is thoroughly covered across multiple files, including `Select.state.test.tsx` and `Select.interactions.test.tsx`, verifying that all callback functions are called with the correct parameters.
