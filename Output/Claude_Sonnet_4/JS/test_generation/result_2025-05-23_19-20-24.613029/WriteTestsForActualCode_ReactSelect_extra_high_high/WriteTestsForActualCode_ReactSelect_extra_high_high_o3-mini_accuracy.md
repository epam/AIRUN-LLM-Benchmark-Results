# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up in the test file  
  The files import and configure Jest and the React Testing Library along with proper setup (e.g., the "jest.config.js" and "src/setupTests.ts" file). This confirms that the testing environment is set up correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test cases are properly isolated and do not have interdependencies  
  Each test file uses isolated describe/it blocks and leverages the common render helper from "testUtils". There is no shared mutable state among tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that DOM events are simulated using proper React Testing Library methods  
  The tests simulate events using userEvent and fireEvent from React Testing Library, ensuring events (click, type, keyboard, touch, etc.) are properly handled.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that accessibility attributes are being tested appropriately  
  The tests check for proper ARIA attributes (aria-expanded, aria-controls, aria-activedescendant, etc.) and validate screen reader support features, confirming that accessibility is thoroughly tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure mocks are used for external dependencies where appropriate  
  External dependencies such as IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver, and scrollIntoView are mocked in the setup file. Additionally, functions such as onChange and onInputChange are replaced with jest.fn() as needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of async/await for asynchronous testing where needed  
  The test cases use async/await patterns along with waitFor to handle asynchronous state updates and DOM changes, ensuring tests reliably wait for the expected outcomes.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all assertions use appropriate Jest matchers  
  Various Jest matchers (toBeInTheDocument, toHaveAttribute, not.toThrow, etc.) are used, indicating that assertions are appropriately checking expected conditions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that tests include proper cleanup after each test case  
  While explicit cleanup isn’t manually called, the React Testing Library’s built-in cleanup mechanism (which runs automatically) ensures that tests do not interfere with each other.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test descriptions clearly indicate what functionality is being tested  
  The describe and it blocks are clearly labeled (e.g., "Basic Rendering," "Accessibility," "User Interactions"), making it easy to understand what each test covers.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the test file follows best practices for organizing test cases (describe/it blocks)  
  The tests are well-organized using nested describe blocks and individual it cases. Each functional area (rendering, interactions, state management, etc.) is isolated logically.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that all event handlers are tested using appropriate simulation methods  
  The tests execute event handlers (click, hover, keyboard actions, touch events) using userEvent and fireEvent appropriately, ensuring that event handling is fully exercised.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the test environment correctly simulates both mouse and keyboard interactions  
  The test cases simulate both mouse interactions (clicks, hovers) and keyboard interactions (typing, key presses) to validate the component’s behavior under different input modalities.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for touch events properly simulate mobile interactions  
  Touch events are simulated using fireEvent.touchStart, fireEvent.touchMove, and fireEvent.touchEnd, effectively emulating mobile/touch interactions.
