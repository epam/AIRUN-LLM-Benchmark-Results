# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist  
  The answer includes a "Basic Rendering" section in the Select.test.tsx file that checks for default behaviors such as rendering a combobox and default placeholder text.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present  
  Multiple tests in the "Keyboard Navigation" section (e.g., ArrowDown, ArrowUp, Enter, Escape, Tab interactions) demonstrate thorough coverage.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)  
  The "Mouse Interactions" block includes tests for click events, outside clicking, hovering, and even touch events, ensuring proper mouse-based behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior  
  The state management tests verify that the component behaves correctly when used as a controlled component, including prop updates and onChange callback invocations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values  
  Tests under "Value Display" and multi-select tests validate that selecting, deselecting, and clearing values properly update the component state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented  
  The tests include scenarios for opening the menu via click, keyboard, and closing the menu on outside clicks or specific key presses.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality  
  The "Option Filtering" section in the search tests covers input-based option filtering and the use of custom filter functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist  
  There is a dedicated "Multi-Select Tests" file that covers multiple selection, deselection, keyboard navigation among selected items, and removal via clear buttons.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility  
  The "Accessibility Tests" section examines ARIA roles, properties (like aria-activedescendant, aria-controls, aria-multiselectable), and live region announcements.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested  
  In the edge cases tests, scenarios such as an empty options array and handling of null/undefined values are validated.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states  
  The test suite includes checks for loading states (e.g., rendering custom loading messages) and error handling during asynchronous scenarios.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states  
  Tests confirm that disabled options receive the proper aria-disabled attribute and that the component properly handles the disabled state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance  
  Performance tests include benchmarks for rendering large datasets and ensuring that performance thresholds are met.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested  
  The test suite verifies that focus is maintained or adjusted correctly during interactions (e.g., focusing input on mount, maintaining focus on selection, and blurring on outside clicks).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering  
  Tests in the basic rendering and value display sections check for the proper rendering of placeholders and selected values.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations  
  The provided test suite does not include any explicit tests verifying the behavior of a custom formatOptionLabel function. There is no reference or dedicated test case for custom formatting of option labels.  
  Although most aspects of the component are well-tested, this specific callback customization remains unverified.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)  
  Numerous tests across different files verify that these callbacks are called with the expected arguments during various interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)  
  Tests exist that check for the presence and functionality of indicator components, including the clear indicator, loading message, and menu dropdown status.
