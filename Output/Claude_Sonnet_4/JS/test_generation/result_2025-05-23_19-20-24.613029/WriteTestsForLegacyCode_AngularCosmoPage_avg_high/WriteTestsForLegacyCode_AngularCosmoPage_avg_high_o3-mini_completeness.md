# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources  
  The REST factory tests in "test/factories/rest.factory.spec.js" include verification for every resource (e.g., blocks, comments, content, users, etc.) and test both GET and PUT methods, confirming full coverage.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly  
  The Page factory tests in "test/factories/page.factory.spec.js" explicitly check default values for all properties and include tests for singleton behavior and property modifications.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly  
  The Users factory tests in "test/factories/users.factory.spec.js" validate initial values for all user-related properties and also check that the service behaves as a singleton.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods  
  The tests in "test/controllers/pageCtrl.spec.js" cover initialization, operations (such as save, update, and delete), event broadcasting, and various edge cases, ensuring thorough coverage of controller behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller  
  The test "should initialize scope.page with Page factory values" confirms that the controller properly initializes page properties based on the Page factory.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation  
  There are specific tests checking that calling titleChange auto-generates a URL from the title, including handling of spaces and punctuation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction  
  Tests for saveLocal ensure that page data is correctly stored into localStorage and that the retrieved values match expected properties.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality  
  The tests simulate a GET request to the tag suggestions endpoint and verify that the autocompleteRecommendations are updated accordingly, including testing the clearing and selection behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)  
  Multiple test cases are provided for savePage in both page creation and update scenarios, including handling duplicates, scheduled publishing, extra fields, and error responses.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types  
  Various edge condition tests are present (e.g., ensuring a page type is provided, checking behavior when URLs are empty) that confirm proper handling of these scenarios.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly  
  The deletion process is fully tested with expectations set for DELETE calls across content, revisions, extras, and tags, and appropriate redirection and event broadcasting are confirmed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions  
  Tests addressing newer version detection, restoration of local version, and deletion of local version data verify that localStorage interactions and version handling are working as intended.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components  
  The suite explicitly states it achieves over 90% coverage and covers almost every defined component in factories, controllers, and integration scenarios.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling  
  The tests consistently verify that events such as 'contentGet', 'notify', and 'settingsGet' are broadcast with the expected payloads, ensuring proper inter-component communication.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality  
  There are specific tests for scheduled publishing which check both future (scheduling) and past (back-dated scheduling) dates, confirming that date handling is robust.
