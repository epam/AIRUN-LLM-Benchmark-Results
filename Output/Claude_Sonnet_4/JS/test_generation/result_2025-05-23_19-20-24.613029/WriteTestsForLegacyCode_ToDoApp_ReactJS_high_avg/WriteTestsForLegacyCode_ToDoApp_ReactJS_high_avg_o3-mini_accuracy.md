# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up with TypeScript support  
  The provided package.json, jest.config.js, and ts-jest setup confirm that TypeScript is properly integrated with Jest and React Testing Library.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test configuration files (jest.config.js, setupTests.ts) are properly configured  
  The configuration files include the necessary settings (e.g., preset, testEnvironment, setupFilesAfterEnv) and handle module mappings appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use proper isolation with no dependencies between test cases  
  The tests consistently use beforeEach to clear mocks and reset state, ensuring that test cases remain isolated from one another.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mocks are implemented for external dependencies and browser APIs (localStorage)  
  Mocks for localStorage, Router, and ReactDOM.findDOMNode are correctly implemented in setupTests.ts and within individual test files.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that component lifecycle methods are properly tested  
  The tests for components (e.g., TodoItem) include checks for lifecycle behaviors such as focusing and setting selection ranges when entering edit mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify both happy paths and edge cases/error conditions  
  The test suite includes multiple scenarios covering normal operations as well as edge cases (e.g., empty titles, invalid JSON in storage, switching filter modes).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use proper describe/it blocks structure for readability  
  The tests are well-organized using describe and it blocks, clearly delineating different test scenarios and sections.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm assertions include meaningful error messages  
  While the tests use standard Jest matchers without many custom message strings, the default error messages are sufficiently descriptive. The confidence is slightly less than 100% because explicit custom error messages were not added, but overall the assertions are clear.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that event handling tests correctly simulate user interactions  
  User events (e.g., clicks, key presses) are simulated using fireEvent and userEvent, accurately testing component behavior under simulated interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests achieve minimum 80% code coverage across all components  
  The coverage report indicates that tests exceed the 80% threshold across statements, branches, functions, and lines.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for UI components verify proper rendering based on props/state  
  Each UI component (TodoFooter, TodoItem, TodoApp) has tests that confirm proper rendering and behavior based on the provided props and internal state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for data management verify proper state updates  
  The TodoModel tests and related data management tests assert that state updates (e.g., addTodo, toggle, save, clearCompleted) occur as expected, confirming the correctness of data handling.
