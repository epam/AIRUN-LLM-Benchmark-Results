    - Issue 1.2 addresses mixed concerns in the component
    - Issue 2.2 directly tackles the monolithic component architecture
    - Issue 5.1 suggests modern React patterns for better component structure
    - The analysis proposes separating validation logic, creating custom hooks, and using functional components

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure prop usage and component interfaces are reviewed

    Prop usage and component interfaces are reviewed throughout the analysis:
    - Issue 2.1 addresses deprecated PropTypes and suggests TypeScript interfaces
    - Issue 4.1 improves prop handling for better accessibility
    - The FormGroup component implementation in section 4.1 shows proper prop destructuring and usage
    - Section 8 provides JSDoc documentation for props and interfaces

- **Pass** (100%): Verify component lifecycle management is analyzed

    Component lifecycle management is analyzed:
    - Issue 2.1 addresses the migration from class components to functional components
    - Issue 3.1 addresses method binding and suggests useCallback for better lifecycle management
    - Issue 5.1 provides a complete implementation using modern React hooks for lifecycle management
    - The analysis recommends React.memo to control component re-rendering

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm API call patterns and error handling are evaluated

    API call patterns and error handling are evaluated:
    - Issue 1.1 improves the async validation API call pattern
    - Issue 1.2 addresses API calls in form submission
    - Issue 7.1 is dedicated to better API error handling with clear examples
    - The apiWithErrorHandling implementation in section 7.1 shows improved error handling for network failures

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure promise handling and asynchronous operations are assessed

    Promise handling and asynchronous operations are assessed:
    - Issue 1.1 directly addresses complex async validation logic with promises
    - Issue 1.2 improves promise handling in form submission using async/await
    - Issue 3.2 addresses inefficient async validation with debouncing
    - Async/await is consistently recommended throughout the analysis to replace Promise chains

- **Pass** (100%): Verify specific code examples are provided for suggested improvements

    Specific code examples are provided for all suggested improvements:
    - Each issue includes "Current Code" and "Improved Code" sections
    - The examples are concrete and implementable
    - Section 5.1 provides a complete modern implementation
    - The code examples clearly demonstrate the implementation of suggested improvements

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm issues are properly categorized by technical aspect

    Issues are properly categorized by technical aspect:
    - The analysis is organized into 8 clear sections (Readability, Maintainability, Performance, etc.)
    - Each issue is numbered according to its category (e.g., Issue 1.1, Issue 2.1)
    - The categorization is logical and consistent
    - Each technical aspect has clearly defined sub-issues

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure before/after code examples demonstrate clear improvements

    The before/after code examples demonstrate clear improvements:
