# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies Angular.js as the framework used  
  The documentation clearly states that the system is “Angular.js-based” and uses Angular-specific constructs (e.g., angular.module, controllers, factories). This is an accurate indication of the framework in use.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all factories (REST, Page, Users) are accurately documented with their purposes  
  Each factory is well-documented, with clear explanations covering their goals (e.g., API communication in REST Factory, global page state in Page Factory, and user session management in Users Factory) along with interface specifications.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of the Page controller and its functionality is technically accurate  
  The Page Controller is described in depth, outlining its role in page creation, editing, and version control. Its key methods and responsibilities (e.g., handling localStorage versions, URL auto-generation, and conflict resolution) are covered accurately.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the RESTful API endpoints are correctly documented  
  The REST Factory section includes a table specifying endpoint patterns, parameters, and available HTTP methods, all of which are consistent with standard RESTful API documentation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of Angular module dependencies ($resource, $location, etc.) is correct  
  The usage examples and controller injection clearly list Angular.js dependencies (such as $resource, $location, $routeParams, etc.), which confirms that the documentation correctly explains module dependency usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the page management features (creating, editing, deleting) are accurately described  
  Features such as saving, deleting, and duplicating pages are detailed through method descriptions and usage examples, which accurately reflect the intended page management operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately explains how the local storage mechanism works  
  The documentation describes the local storage integration, including draft management and version recovery, along with specific methods (e.g., localVersion(), deleteNewerVersion())—all providing an accurate overview of local storage usage.

- **Pass** (90%): Check that the description of form validation logic is technically accurate  
  While the form section notes the presence of required field indicators, error states, and character counters, the actual validation logic isn’t deeply detailed. However, the provided explanation is consistent with common Angular.js practices.  
  Explanation: The documentation covers validation aspects at a high level, so although details are brief, nothing appears technically incorrect.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of publish/schedule date handling is correct  
  The document accurately describes publishing options—including draft, publish, and scheduled publishing—as well as the use of a DateTime picker, matching common implementation patterns in CMS interfaces.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the tag management and autocomplete feature explanation is technically accurate  
  The explanation of tag management is supported by the mention of “autocompleteTags” and “selectSuggestion(tag)” methods, as well as the form element attributes (e.g., ng-list), making the description technically sound.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the relationship between controllers, factories, and templates is accurately explained  
  The documentation explicitly explains the connections between controllers (handling logic), factories (managing data and state), and templates (providing the UI), which accurately represents Angular.js architecture.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation correctly identifies and explains the purpose of broadcast events  
  The documentation briefly mentions the use of $rootScope.$broadcast for announcement of dynamic updates and status messages, accurately reflecting the role of broadcast events in Angular.js applications.
