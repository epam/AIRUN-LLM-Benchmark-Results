- **Pass** (95%): Confirm that the asynchronous validation process for name and email fields is correctly documented
  
  The documentation describes the asynchronous validation process conceptually but the code example for `asyncValidate` references functions (`checkEmail()` and `checkName()`) that aren't fully defined in the provided code snippet. While the general flow is correctly documented, this minor implementation detail makes it slightly incomplete.
