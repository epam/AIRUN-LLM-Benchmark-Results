# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x
  
  The component is implemented with React's modern hooks (useState, useRef, useEffect, useCallback) which are compatible with React 18.x. The implementation imports from 'react' and uses functional components with hooks.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
  
  The code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions, including interfaces like `SelectOption` and `SearchableSelectProps`. The component is properly typed as `React.FC<SearchableSelectProps>` and all props, state variables, and function parameters have appropriate types.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling
  
  The submission includes a comprehensive index.css file with styling for all component states and features.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments
  
  The code is clean, well-organized, and has no TODO comments. It follows consistent formatting and has meaningful variable names.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility
  
  The component uses useState hooks to manage state for:
  - isOpen: tracks dropdown visibility
  - searchTerm: manages the search input value
  - highlightedIndex: tracks which option is currently highlighted

  These state variables are properly managed throughout the component's lifecycle.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props
  
  The component accepts various customizable props including:
  - options: array of selectable items
  - value: currently selected value
  - placeholder: customizable placeholder text
  - onChange: callback for selection changes
  - disabled: to disable the component
  - className: for custom styling
  - aria-label and aria-labelledby: for accessibility

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection
  
  The component implements comprehensive keyboard navigation through the `handleKeyDown` function, supporting:
  - Arrow Up/Down for navigation
  - Enter for selection
  - Escape to close dropdown
  - Tab for focus management

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions
  
  The component uses useRef appropriately for DOM interactions:
  - containerRef: for click outside detection
  - inputRef: for input focus management
  - listRef: for dropdown management
  - optionRefs: for scrolling highlighted options into view

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques
  
  The component handles focus appropriately:
  - Uses focus management in useEffect to focus the search input when dropdown opens
  - Maintains focus on the input after selection
  - Uses aria-activedescendant to indicate the active descendant

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
  
  The component implements extensive ARIA attributes:
  - role="combobox" on the container
  - aria-expanded to indicate dropdown state
  - role="listbox" and role="option" for the dropdown
  - aria-selected, aria-disabled for options
  - aria-controls to associate the input with the listbox
  - aria-activedescendant to indicate the active option
  - aria-label and aria-labelledby for labeling

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  The code doesn't contain any console.log, console.error, or other debugging statements. It handles potential errors gracefully with proper null checks and default values.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component
  
  The component optimizes rendering by:
  - Using useCallback for event handlers to prevent unnecessary recreation
  - Using useRef to maintain references without triggering re-renders
  - Properly structuring effects with dependency arrays
