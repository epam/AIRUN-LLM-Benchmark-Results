# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  Although the code does not explicitly mention React 18.x, it uses modern React features such as functional components, hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback), and React.FC. These practices are consistent with React 18.x, so we can reasonably conclude it is implemented using React 18.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  The implementation uses the .tsx extension, defines TypeScript interfaces (e.g., SelectOption, SearchableSelectProps), and provides explicit type annotations for props, refs, and event handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  An index.css file is provided and included in the code, which styles the component as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  The code is well-structured, follows best practices, and does not contain any TODO comments or placeholder code.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  The component manages its state using useState for properties like isOpen, searchTerm, and highlightedIndex. It also handles the selected option via props and external state management using onChange.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  The component accepts a range of customizable props (options, value, placeholder, disabled, className, aria-label, aria-labelledby, and onChange), making it flexible and reusable in different contexts.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  The handleKeyDown handler covers navigation with ArrowUp, ArrowDown, and selection actions with Enter, as well as closing the dropdown with Escape and Tab, ensuring keyboard accessibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  The code makes appropriate use of useRef to manage DOM elements (container, input, list, optionRefs) and handles outside click events and scrolling behavior correctly.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  Focus management is addressed by moving focus to the input when closing the dropdown and ensuring that, upon opening, the component provides focus to the appropriate element. The implementation shows a good handling of focus; however, minor testing in a live environment would further confirm its robustness.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  The component includes ARIA attributes such as role="combobox", role="listbox", aria-expanded, aria-haspopup, aria-label, and aria-activedescendant, which strongly support accessibility requirements.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  While we cannot execute the code in this report, the code appears clean and does not include any known anti-patterns or deprecated features that might lead to console errors or warnings. There is high confidence in this pass based on the code structure.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  The implementation uses useCallback and useEffect hooks with proper dependency arrays to optimize re-renders. Although the useCallback for updateHighlight depends on enabledFilteredOptions.length, which might not capture all changes in the options array, overall, the code shows careful attention to performance. This yields a pass with slightly lower confidence due to the potential subtle dependency nuances.
