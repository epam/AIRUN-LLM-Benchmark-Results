# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component returns a container with the class "searchable-select" and conditionally renders the dropdown (an unordered list element) when the state flag isOpen is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  The component uses an input element within the input container. When the dropdown is open (isOpen true), the input is not read-only and accepts search text, thereby acting as a search input.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The component implements selection logic via the selectOption function which passes the selected option to the onChange callback. This supports single item selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The handleKeyDown function handles "ArrowDown" and "ArrowUp" keys by updating the highlighted index, allowing for keyboard navigation through the dropdown options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  When the Enter key is pressed, the component checks if an option is highlighted and then calls selectOption on that option, confirming the item selection via keyboard.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  If the component is focused and Enter is pressed while the dropdown is closed, the openDropdown function is invoked, toggling the dropdown to open.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  The closeDropdown function explicitly calls inputRef.current?.focus(), ensuring focus is returned to the select element upon closing the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  Clicking on an option triggers the handleOptionClick function which eventually calls closeDropdown, properly closing the dropdown on mouse selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  The selection via the Enter key in keyboard navigation also triggers the selectOption function and then closeDropdown, ensuring the dropdown closes as expected using the keyboard.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  The handleKeyDown function listens for the Escape key and, upon detection, calls closeDropdown to close the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  An effect hook adds an event listener to detect clicks outside the component's container and triggers closeDropdown, ensuring the dropdown is closed on an outside click.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  When the component is focused and the Enter key is pressed while the dropdown is closed, the openDropdown function is invoked, thereby opening the dropdown.
