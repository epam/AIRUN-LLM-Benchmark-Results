# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
    
    The application fetches character data from the SWAPI (Star Wars API) in the `useCharacters` hook and displays it in a list format using the `CharacterList` component. The API call is made to "https://swapi.dev/api/people" which is the correct endpoint for Star Wars characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
    
    The application implements a loading spinner in the `Loading` component with animation using CSS keyframes. The loading state is managed in the `useCharacters` hook and the spinner is displayed when `loading` is true in the `App` component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
    
    The application shows all characters received from the API response in the `CharacterList` component. It correctly maps over the array of character data and renders a `CharacterCard` for each character.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
    
    The application is a simple display of character data with no search functionality or user input fields present in any component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
    
    Each character is displayed with their name prominently shown in the `CharacterCard` component, along with additional details like gender, birth year, height, and eye color.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
    
    The application structure follows the Create React App pattern with the appropriate package.json configuration, folder structure, and build scripts. The dependencies listed include react-scripts and other standard CRA packages.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
    
    The application implements proper state management using the custom `useCharacters` hook that tracks loading state, error state, and character data. This state is appropriately used in the App component to render different UIs based on the current state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
    
    Each `CharacterCard` component in the list is given a unique key based on the character's URL: `<CharacterCard key={character.url} character={character} />`. This provides a stable, unique identifier for each item in the list.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
    
    The application handles empty data states with a conditional rendering in the App component: `if (!characters || characters.length === 0) { return <div style={styles.container}><p style={styles.message}>No characters found.</p></div>; }`. This ensures users see a meaningful message when no data is available.
