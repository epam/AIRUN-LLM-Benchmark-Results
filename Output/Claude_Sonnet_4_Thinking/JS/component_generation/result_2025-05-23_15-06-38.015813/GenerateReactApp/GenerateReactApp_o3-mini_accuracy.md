# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses React 18.x or newer by checking the package.json dependencies  
  The package.json clearly lists "react": "^18.2.0" and "react-dom": "^18.2.0", confirming React 18.x is used.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that TypeScript is properly implemented with appropriate type definitions for all components, props, and states  
  The code includes TypeScript files, interfaces for the data (e.g., Character, SwapiResponse, FetchState), and the components use proper TypeScript annotations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Axios is used for API requests to fetch data from the Star Wars API endpoint  
  The file src/services/api.ts uses Axios to make GET requests to the endpoint "https://swapi.dev/api/people".

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles API errors gracefully with appropriate error states or messages  
  The try-catch block in the fetchCharacters function and the error state management in the useCharacters hook ensure that any API error is captured and displayed via the ErrorMessage component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the character data is fetched on component mount using the useEffect hook  
  The useCharacters hook calls loadCharacters via useEffect, ensuring data is fetched once the component mounts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application properly manages component rendering optimization  
  Components such as Loading, ErrorMessage, CharacterCard, and CharacterList are wrapped with React.memo to optimize rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows React best practices using hooks appropriately  
  The code cleanly separates concerns using custom hooks (useCharacters), properly manages state, and uses useEffect and useCallback where needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't contain any TODO comments or unnecessary code  
  The code is free of any TODO comments and includes only code that implements the necessary functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the codebase has minimal comments that only clarify complex logic when necessary  
  Comments are provided to explain setup or complex logic in a concise manner without being excessive.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the API endpoint "https://swapi.dev/api/people" is being called correctly  
  In the API service, the endpoint "/people" is appended to the base URL "https://swapi.dev/api", ensuring the API is called correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application renders without console errors or warnings  
  Based on the provided implementation and adherence to React and TypeScript best practices, the code is structured to avoid common console errors and warnings.
