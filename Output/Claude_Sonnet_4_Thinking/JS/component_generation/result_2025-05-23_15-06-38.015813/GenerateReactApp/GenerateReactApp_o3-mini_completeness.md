# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The application fetches data from SWAPI using a custom hook (useCharacters) and the CharacterList component displays the characters in a grid layout as provided in the implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The Loading component renders a spinner and a loading text while data is being fetched, which meets this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  The useCharacters hook captures the characters from the API response and passes them to the CharacterList component, which iterates over them and displays each character using the CharacterCard component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  The implementation focuses solely on fetching and displaying characters. There are no search inputs or filters included in any part of the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  The CharacterCard component prominently displays the character’s name (using an h3 tag) along with additional details, fulfilling this step.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The file structure, package.json dependencies, and scripts indicate that the application is scaffolded based on Create React App with a TypeScript template.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The custom hook (useCharacters) handles state management including data (characters), loading, and error states. The UI adapts based on these states (displaying Loading, ErrorMessage, or the CharacterList accordingly).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  In the CharacterList component, each CharacterCard is rendered with a unique key using character.url, ensuring optimal rendering performance.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  The App component checks if characters is null or the array is empty and displays a “No characters found.” message, thereby handling empty states.
