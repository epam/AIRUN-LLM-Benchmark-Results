# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type  
  The input elementâ€™s onChange handler (handleSearchChange) correctly updates the searchState.query in the component's state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls  
  A useEffect hook is used with a 300ms setTimeout to update the debouncedQuery, ensuring API calls are made only after the delay.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured  
  The code imports axios and uses axios.get with proper TypeScript generics to fetch data from the API.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses  
  Interfaces for Character, SwapiResponse, and SearchState are defined and used throughout the component, and the component itself is typed as React.FC.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters  
  The URL is conditionally built using the search query, with proper trimming and URL encoding, ensuring correct endpoint construction.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate  
  The component leverages useCallback for the fetchCharacters function and handleSearchChange, as well as useMemo for computed values like isLoading, showNoResults, and resultsCount.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback  
  A try/catch block is present in the fetchCharacters function with axios-specific error handling, and an error message is displayed with a retry button when an error occurs.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing  
  The debouncing mechanism ensures that fetchCharacters is invoked only after the debouncedQuery is updated following a pause in typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices  
  The component uses useState and useEffect properly to manage local state for search queries, loading, error, and the characters list in a clear and organized manner.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code  
  The code is clean with all imports utilized, no commented-out code, and error handling that logs errors to the console appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests  
  The loading state is updated at the beginning and end of API requests, and there's also a dedicated isSearching state for search-specific loading feedback.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns  
  The use of functional components with hooks such as useEffect, useState, useMemo, and useCallback aligns with current React best practices suitable for React 18.x.
