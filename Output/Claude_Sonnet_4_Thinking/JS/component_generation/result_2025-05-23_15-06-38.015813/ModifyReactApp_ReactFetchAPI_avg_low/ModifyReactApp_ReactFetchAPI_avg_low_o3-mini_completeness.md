# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The component includes an input field with placeholder text and an onChange handler that updates the search state, which is used to filter characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  A loading indicator is shown on initial load (spinner with a text message) and a separate spinner is rendered within the search input when a search is in progress.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  The initial useEffect hook calls fetchCharacters using an empty debounced search query, ensuring data is loaded on mount.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  The component uses state and a debounced effect so that as the user types, the API call is triggered after a 300ms delay, updating the search results accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  A conditional render shows a dedicated “No characters found” message with suggestions when there are no results for a given query.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The component utilizes inline styling with relative measurements (e.g., max-width, margins, paddings) that help support responsiveness. However, explicit media queries or breakpoints are not seen, which could improve responsiveness even further.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  The code conditionally renders a list of character items when valid search results exist, displaying the correct number of results.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  The component implements error handling for API calls by setting an error state and showing an error message with a retry button. Although it does not employ React’s formal Error Boundary (using componentDidCatch or an error boundary component) for render-time errors, the implemented error handling for API calls covers the immediate requirements for this use case.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  All necessary interfaces (Character, SwapiResponse, SearchState) are clearly defined, and the component is properly typed with TypeScript.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The code successfully integrates the search functionality without compromising the original feature set of displaying the Star Wars characters list.
