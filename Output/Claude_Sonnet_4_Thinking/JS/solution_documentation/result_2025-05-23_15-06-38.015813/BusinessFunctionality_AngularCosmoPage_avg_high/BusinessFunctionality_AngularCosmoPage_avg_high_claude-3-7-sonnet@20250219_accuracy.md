    The documentation mentions the revision system and indicates that there is "Complete revision history tracking" and discusses content revisions in several places. It also mentions "extensible metadata system through 'extras'" in the Technical Content Requirements section.

The information provided is accurate but somewhat less detailed compared to other features.
