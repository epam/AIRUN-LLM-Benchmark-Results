  The documentation clearly outlines this in the User Workflows section ("Page Editing: Load → Modify → Version Check → Save/Update").

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the documentation describes the page duplication feature
  
  The documentation mentions the duplication feature in the Action Bar section ("Context-sensitive buttons (Save, Delete, Duplicate) with confirmation states") and references it again in the Publishing Workflow Requirements section ("Allow content duplication for efficiency").

- **Pass** (90%): Validate the documentation explains the page deletion process
  
  The documentation mentions deletion in the Action Bar section and implies it in various other sections, particularly in the CRUD operations and Administrative Functions sections.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the auto-URL generation from title feature
  
  The documentation clearly describes this in the Form Fields section ("URL input with auto-generation capability") and reinforces it in the Content Authoring Requirements section ("Maintain SEO-friendly URLs with auto-generation").

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains tag management and autocompletion
  
  The documentation thoroughly explains this feature in multiple sections, including Form Fields, User Workflows, and Content Authoring Requirements.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the publication status options (publish, draft, schedule)
  
  The documentation clearly describes these options in the Form Fields section and elaborates on them in the Publishing Workflow Requirements section.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains scheduled content publishing
  
  The documentation covers this feature in both the Form Fields section and the Publishing Workflow Requirements section.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes page revision management
  
  The documentation clearly explains this in the Core Functionality section ("Revision System: Complete revision history tracking") and elaborates in the Publishing Workflow Requirements section.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the documentation explains the handling of page extras and additional data
  
  The documentation mentions "extensible metadata system through 'extras'" in the Technical Content Requirements section and refers to "extras" in the Data Management Approach section.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes form validation mechanisms
  
  The documentation includes a dedicated Validation Mechanisms section that thoroughly describes the various validation mechanisms.

- **Pass** (80%): Validate the documentation explains error handling during API operations
  
  The documentation mentions "comprehensive error handling" in the Summary section and implies it in various other sections, but doesn't provide specific details about how API errors are handled.

- **Pass** (80%): Ensure the documentation describes notification messaging for user feedback
  
  The documentation implies notification messaging in sections like Action Bar and conflict resolution, but doesn't explicitly describe a notification system.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the tag suggestion system based on user input
  
  The documentation thoroughly explains this feature in the Form Fields section, User Workflows section, and again in other relevant sections.
