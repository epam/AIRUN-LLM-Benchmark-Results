# Evaluation Report

1. **Fail** (90%): Ensure the documentation identifies all major components (REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, pageCtrl)  
   The documentation clearly mentions the REST API factory, Page data factory, and Users factory, but it does not explicitly identify or refer to the page controller (pageCtrl).

2. **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the purpose of the REST factory for API communication  
   The analysis discusses a REST API abstraction and includes a CRUD code snippet, which confirms the REST factory’s role.

3. **Pass** (95%): Confirm the documentation describes all API endpoints exposed in the REST factory  
   The report provides a code snippet with RESTful endpoints (e.g., /api/content/:id) and discusses nested resources and custom methods. Although it does not list every endpoint detail, the coverage is sufficient.

4. **Pass** (90%): Validate the documentation explains the Page factory and its role in storing global page variables  
   The documentation refers to the Page factory under the Factory Pattern and mentions global state management. However, the explanation is somewhat generic regarding global page variables.

5. **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the Users factory and its purpose for user data management  
   The document clearly explains that the Users factory is used for centralized user state management and tracking content authorship.

6. **Fail** (90%): Verify the documentation explains the page controller's responsibilities and features  
   There is no clear mention or detailed explanation of the page controller (pageCtrl) responsibilities; the discussion centers on UI components and factories instead.

7. **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the local storage mechanism for unsaved changes  
   The text explicitly explains local storage caching for draft management and backup of user input.

8. **Pass** (90%): Validate the documentation explains the version comparison functionality  
   The analysis mentions version control, conflict resolution, and version checking to prevent unnecessary API calls. It could be more detailed in describing the comparison logic, but it meets the requirement.

9. **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the page creation workflow  
   The document clearly outlines the page creation workflow (New → Type Selection → Content Entry → Publish/Save).

10. **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page editing workflow  
    The page editing workflow is identified (Load → Modify → Version Check → Save/Update).

11. **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the page duplication feature  
    The feature is briefly described as part of the Action Bar options (Save, Delete, Duplicate).

12. **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains the page deletion process  
    The deletion process is noted among the context-sensitive buttons in the Action Bar.

13. **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the auto-URL generation from title feature  
    The URL input field is noted to have auto-generation capability based on the title, satisfying this step.

14. **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains tag management and autocompletion  
    Tag management is well covered with mentions of an auto-complete tag system and tag input with suggestions.

15. **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the publication status options (publish, draft, schedule)  
    The publication status options are clearly identified in the form fields with radio buttons.

16. **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains scheduled content publishing  
    Scheduled publishing is detailed both in the form fields (with a date picker) and within the publishing workflow requirements.

17. **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes page revision management  
    The revision system is addressed, including complete revision history tracking and version control mechanisms.

18. **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the handling of page extras and additional data  
    The analysis discusses an extensible metadata system (including "extras") and the normalized storage of related data.

19. **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes form validation mechanisms  
    The document details several validation mechanisms (required fields, URL uniqueness, non-empty URL, character counters, schedule date validation).

20. **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains error handling during API operations  
    Although briefly, the summary mentions “robust data management strategies” and “comprehensive error handling,” which implies API error handling.

21. **Fail** (90%): Ensure the documentation describes notification messaging for user feedback  
    There is little to no explicit discussion on how the application notifies users of errors, confirmations, or other feedback beyond confirmation states in the Action Bar.

22. **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the theme-specific page types feature  
    The document clearly describes theme integration, including dynamic page type selection based on available themes.

23. **Fail** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the featured image handling  
    There is no mention of any featured image handling in the analysis.

24. **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains URL validation and error handling  
    URL validation is discussed through the requirements for uniqueness and non-empty URL checks.

25. **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the tag suggestion system based on user input  
    The analysis successfully notes that the tag input supports autocomplete with suggestions based on user input.
