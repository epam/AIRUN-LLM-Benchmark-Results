- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the documentation correctly explains the Promise-based architecture for parallel validation checks

    While the documentation mentions "Promise-based API" for efficient async operations for validation and submission, it doesn't explicitly mention parallel validation checks. It references debounced validation and async validation but doesn't clearly state that validation checks are performed in parallel.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation accurately describes the user flow from form completion to successful signup

- **Fail** (95%): Confirm that the documentation correctly identifies the document title management using react-document-title

    The documentation does not explicitly mention react-document-title or any document title management. While the document thoroughly covers many aspects of the signup component, this specific feature is not addressed anywhere in the documentation.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate that the documentation accurately describes the integration with React Router for navigation

    The documentation does mention React-Router under Dependencies and Libraries, and briefly mentions "Router: Navigation to login page" under Integration Points. It also mentions "Navigation Link: Option to navigate to login page" in the UI elements. However, it doesn't provide detailed information about how React Router is specifically implemented or configured for navigation within the application.
