- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the form fields (name, email, password) and their validation requirements.  
  It details fields with requirements (e.g., name length, valid email format, and password minimum length).

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains the synchronous validation logic for form fields.  
  The documentation specifies real-time, client-side validation (e.g., on blur events for immediate feedback).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the form submission process and API interaction.  
  The document covers form submission steps and integration with an API layer (e.g., using api.signup()).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the success and error handling during form submission.  
  Success states (automatic authentication and redirection) and error handling (field-level messages, disabling submission) are described.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains the Redux integration for form state management.  
  The use of both Redux and Redux-Form for managing form state and authentication is clearly mentioned.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the visual feedback mechanisms for form validation.  
  It explains the use of visual indicators (green/red styling) and error messages for immediate feedback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the FormGroup component and its role in displaying validation feedback.  
  The FormGroup is identified as a reusable wrapper for field styling and error display.

  React-Router is mentioned explicitly for navigation handling (e.g., redirecting to login).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains how the form handles submission states (submitting, disabled).  
  The submission state is discussed in terms of loading state and preventing multiple submissions.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the use of react-document-title for page title management.  
  There is no mention of react-document-title; only a static page title is provided.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate the documentation explains the Redux Form configuration and field setup.  
  Although Redux-Form integration is mentioned, details on the configuration and explicit field setup are only provided at a high level. This leads to a slightly lower confidence rating.
