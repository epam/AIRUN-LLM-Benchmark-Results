# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
  All functions (create/update via savePage, deletePage, and duplicate behavior via the duplicate parameter in savePage) are present in the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
  The PageForm displays a select box for page types and the onTypeChange handler is provided, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
  The handleTitleChange in the custom hook triggers URL auto-generation when the current URL is ‘/new’, ‘new’ or empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
  Tag changes trigger dispatching of autocompleteTags, and the PageForm shows tag suggestions and allows selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
  The PageForm provides radio buttons for “Publish,” “Draft,” and “Schedule” as required.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
  When the “schedule” option is selected, a datetime-local input is conditionally rendered to set a publishing date.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
  The usePageEditor hook uses useLocalStorage and compares localStorage values to the currentPage state to detect newer versions.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
  While errors are logged via console.error, there is no dedicated notification system (e.g., toast messages or alerts) to inform users of success or errors.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
  Although the page type select includes a required attribute, the URL field does not have any explicit validation logic beyond basic input binding. This might lead to potential issues with invalid or missing URL input.  
  (Confidence is 90% because the page type field is marked as required but URL validation is notably absent.)

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
  The ApiService includes endpoints for content, tags, extras, and revisions. Minor uncertainties exist due to lack of integration details, but overall the endpoints are defined.  
  (Confidence is 90% because while endpoints are defined, their full integration in UI isn’t demonstrated for extras and revisions.)

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
  Although the ApiService handles contentExtras and there are extras properties in the Page type, there is no explicit UI or Redux actions dedicated to managing extras.  
  (Confidence is 90% due to the presence in the API but absence of corresponding UI management.)

- **Fail** (90%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
  The ApiService contains endpoints for content revisions and their extras; however, the UI and state management layers do not demonstrate handling or displaying revision history.  
  (Confidence is 90% because API endpoints exist but no front-end mechanism or Redux management for revisions is visible.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
  The project structure clearly separates folders for types, store (slices), services, hooks, and UI components, achieving a proper separation of concerns.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
  The application incorporates i18next and uses translation keys in the UI components, ensuring that internationalization is intact.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
  The routing configuration using React Router (paths “/new”, “/:url”, and “/”) preserves the expected URL structure from the original design.
