# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling
  
  The SignupComponent clearly implements Angular's Reactive Forms with FormBuilder, FormGroup, and FormControl. This is evident in the `initializeForm()` method and the use of `[formGroup]` and `formControlName` directives in the template.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)
  
  The CustomValidators class properly implements synchronous validators that check:
  - Name length between 3-60 characters
  - Email format using a regular expression
  - Password minimum length of 6 characters

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use
  
  AsyncValidators are correctly implemented in the CustomValidators class. The `nameAsyncValidator` and `emailAsyncValidator` methods use the AuthService to check if the name or email is already in use via API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched
  
  The FormGroupComponent correctly handles form validation states and applies appropriate CSS classes (`has-error`, `has-success`) based on the control's state (touched and valid/invalid).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions
  
  The onSubmit method in SignupComponent dispatches the signup action with user input data. The AuthEffects intercepts this action and calls the signup method in AuthService, which makes the API call.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails
  
  The FormGroupComponent displays error messages via `<span class="help-block" *ngIf="hasError">{{ errorMessage }}</span>` when validation fails, and the implementation correctly extracts the first validation error message.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service
  
  The SignupComponent correctly sets the page title to "Signup - PodBaby" using Angular's Title service in the ngOnInit method.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management
  
  The code includes proper NgRx implementation with actions, effects, and reducer. The SignupComponent interacts with the store for state management and the module imports the necessary NgRx modules.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress
  
  The submit button uses the `[disabled]="isSubmitting || signupForm.invalid"` attribute, which correctly disables the button during submission and when the form is invalid.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses
  
  The AuthEffects properly handles both success and error cases from the API call using the `map` and `catchError` operators, dispatching appropriate success or failure actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management
  
  The SignupComponent follows best practices by:
  - Implementing OnInit and OnDestroy interfaces
  - Properly cleaning up subscriptions using takeUntil pattern with destroy$ Subject
  - Using proper dependency injection
  - Separating template, logic, and styles

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises
  
  The AuthService correctly uses Angular's HttpClient for API calls, returning Observables instead of Promises.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements
  
  The validation error messages in the CustomValidators class match the expected requirements:
  - "Name must be between 3 and 60 characters in length"
  - "A valid email address is required"
  - "Password must be at least 6 characters"
  - "This name is already in use"
  - "This email is already in use"
