# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component includes all three required form fields: name, email, and password
  
  The signup component clearly includes all three required form fields: name, email, and password inputs, each with their corresponding formControlName attributes in the signup.component.html file.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page includes a heading 'Join PodBaby today.'
  
  The signup.component.html file includes `<h2>Join PodBaby today.</h2>` at the top of the form.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a lead paragraph about membership benefits
  
  The signup page includes a lead paragraph with the text: "As a member you can subscribe to podcast feeds and keep track of your favorite episodes."

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form includes a submit button with appropriate styling and icon
  
  The submit button is present with the btn and btn-primary classes for styling, and includes a Font Awesome icon (`<i class="fa fa-sign-in" aria-hidden="true"></i>`).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a link to the login page with appropriate text
  
  The signup page includes a link to the login page with the text "Already a member? Log in here." using the routerLink directive.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the FormGroup component or equivalent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display
  
  The FormGroupComponent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display, with proper CSS classes for error and success states and methods to get error messages.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the Icon component or equivalent is implemented for the signup button
  
  The code uses a standard Font Awesome icon with `<i class="fa fa-sign-in" aria-hidden="true"></i>` rather than a dedicated Icon component. There is no evidence in the provided code of a separate Icon component being used.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all validation rules are implemented (name length, email format, password length)
  
  The validation rules are implemented in the CustomValidators class with specific validators for name length (3-60 characters), email format (via regex), and password length (minimum 6 characters).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure asynchronous validation for both name and email uniqueness is implemented
  
  Asynchronous validation for both name and email uniqueness is implemented using the nameAsyncValidator and emailAsyncValidator methods that make API calls to check if the name or email is already in use.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API integration is complete with proper error handling
  
  The signup API integration is complete with the AuthService, AuthActions, AuthEffects, and proper error handling using catchError and returning appropriate failure actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form layout matches the horizontal form structure specified
  
  The form has the class "form-horizontal" and the CSS in signup.component.scss sets max-width for the form and centers it, which matches a horizontal form structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page has proper document title setting functionality
  
  The SignupComponent sets the document title using the Title service from @angular/platform-browser in the ngOnInit method: `this.titleService.setTitle('Signup - PodBaby');`
