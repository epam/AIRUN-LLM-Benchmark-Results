# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The component uses FormBuilder and fb.group to create the form, confirming the usage of Angular's Reactive Forms.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The CustomValidators applied to the name, email, and password fields check for the required length and format as specified.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  The form configuration includes asynchronous validators (nameAsyncValidator and emailAsyncValidator) that call corresponding service methods to check if the name or email is already in use.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The FormGroupComponent computes properties (hasError and hasSuccess) based on the controlâ€™s touched state and error presence, and applies related CSS classes for styling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  In the onSubmit() method, once the form is valid and not submitting, the code dispatches the signup action. The AuthEffects then handles the API call, dispatching success or failure actions accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The FormGroupComponent template includes a span with class "help-block" that displays error messages when the control has errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  The SignupComponent sets the page title to "Signup - PodBaby" in the ngOnInit() using the Title service.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The component dispatches actions to the store and subscribes to auth state changes. Additionally, the module configures StoreModule.forFeature and EffectsModule.forFeature, confirming proper usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button in the HTML template is disabled when isSubmitting is true or when the form is invalid.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  The AuthEffects handles the signup effect with proper use of map to dispatch success actions and catchError to dispatch failure actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component implements OnInit and OnDestroy, uses a Subject with takeUntil for unsubscribing from observables, and separates concerns between presentation, logic, and state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The AuthService uses Angular's HttpClient to make HTTP requests, wrapping responses in observables as recommended.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The custom validators return clear, descriptive error messages (e.g., for name length, email format, and duplicate name/email checks). While the messages appear to meet typical requirements, slight deviations from an explicitly provided specification might exist. This assessment is therefore slightly conservative, though the overall approach is correct.
