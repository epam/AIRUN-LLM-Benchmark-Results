# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component includes all three required form fields: name, email, and password  
  The signup component template includes input fields for name, email, and password, matching the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page includes a heading 'Join PodBaby today.'  
  The template displays the heading as <h2>Join PodBaby today.</h2>.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a lead paragraph about membership benefits  
  A paragraph with the class "lead" is present, describing the membership benefits.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form includes a submit button with appropriate styling and icon  
  The form contains a submit button styled with "btn btn-primary form-control" and includes an icon (<i class="fa fa-sign-in" aria-hidden="true"></i>).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a link to the login page with appropriate text  
  A link is provided at the bottom with the text "Already a member? Log in here." linking to the login route.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the FormGroup component or equivalent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display  
  The custom FormGroupComponent is implemented with logic to display errors and success states along with appropriate styling in its SCSS file.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the Icon component or equivalent is implemented for the signup button  
  Although there is no separate Icon component, the usage of the <i> tag with appropriate classes (fa fa-sign-in) serves the equivalent purpose. Confidence is slightly less than 100% because a dedicated Icon component was not used, but the requirement is fulfilled by other means.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all validation rules are implemented (name length, email format, password length)  
  The validators.ts file defines synchronous validators for name length, email format, and password length.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure asynchronous validation for both name and email uniqueness is implemented  
  Asynchronous validators in the validators.ts file (nameAsyncValidator and emailAsyncValidator) properly handle uniqueness using the AuthService.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API integration is complete with proper error handling  
  The AuthService communicates with the backend via HTTP, and the AuthEffects handle API responses including error handling with catchError.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form layout matches the horizontal form structure specified  
  The form is wrapped within a container having the "form-horizontal" class, meeting the form structure requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page has proper document title setting functionality  
  The SignupComponent uses Title service to set the document title to "Signup - PodBaby" during initialization.
