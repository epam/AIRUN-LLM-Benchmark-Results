# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The code explicitly mentions Angular 14.x in the opening statement and the package.json dependencies show Angular 14-compatible NgRx versions (`"@ngrx/store": "^14.0.0"`, etc.).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
  
  The implementation includes @ngrx/store in package.json and properly implements NgRx store with the todoReducer in app.module.ts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
  
  The solution includes @ngrx/effects package and implements TodoEffects class with proper effects for loading and saving todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
  
  The solution includes well-structured actions (todo.actions.ts), reducers (todo.reducer.ts), and selectors (todo.selectors.ts) that handle all required functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
  
  All components correctly use @Component decorator, and child components properly use @Input and @Output decorators for component interaction.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators
  
  React refs are replaced with Angular's @ViewChild, as seen in the TodoItemComponent where `@ViewChild('editInput') editInput!: ElementRef<HTMLInputElement>;` is used.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
  
  The components correctly use @Input() for properties (like todo, editing) and @Output() EventEmitter for events (like toggle, delete, edit, save).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
  
  The solution includes appropriate Angular services: UtilsService, StorageService, and RouteFilterService, all properly implemented with @Injectable decorators.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
  
  Dependency injection is correctly implemented throughout the application, with services and the store being injected via constructor parameters.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
  
  While the components use the default change detection strategy, which is acceptable, there is no explicit use of OnPush strategy mentioned in the code which could be beneficial for performance optimization in complex components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
  
  The application correctly implements Angular Router with a proper AppRoutingModule and routing configuration that handles the filter routes (/all, /active, /completed).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code follows Angular style guide conventions with proper naming (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for class names), organization (feature modules, services, components), and structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
  
  The application defines and uses proper TypeScript interfaces and types (Todo, AppState, TodoFilter) throughout the codebase.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
  
  All React JSX templates have been properly converted to Angular template syntax with correct Angular-specific directives like *ngIf, *ngFor, [class], and event bindings.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
  
  React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings using the (event) syntax throughout the templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs
  
  The code appears complete without any TODO comments or unfinished implementations.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules
  
  The solution does not implement lazy loading for feature modules. The AppModule imports all components directly without any lazy-loaded routes or feature modules.
