# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items

    The application displays todos through the `app-todo-main` component which renders a list of todos. The component correctly subscribes to the filtered todos from the store and displays them using `*ngFor` directive with the `app-todo-item` component for each todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented

    The add todo functionality is implemented in the `TodoHeaderComponent` which captures user input and dispatches the `addTodo` action when the Enter key is pressed. The reducer properly adds the new todo to the state with a unique ID.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works

    The toggle functionality is implemented in the `TodoItemComponent` with a checkbox input that emits a `toggle` event. The parent component (`TodoMainComponent`) handles this event by dispatching the `toggleTodo` action which updates the todo's completed status in the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented

    Editing is implemented with the double-click event on the todo item label, which triggers the edit mode by emitting an `edit` event that's handled by setting the `editingTodoId` in the store. The component provides full editing capability with proper keyboard controls for saving and canceling.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented

    Deletion is implemented with a destroy button in each `TodoItemComponent` that emits a `delete` event which is handled by dispatching the `deleteTodo` action to remove the todo from the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented

    The "Mark all as complete" functionality is implemented in the `TodoMainComponent` with the toggle-all checkbox that dispatches the `toggleAllTodos` action when changed. The reducer correctly updates all todos to the target completed state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works

    Filtering is implemented using Angular Router with routes for all, active, and completed todos. The `RouteFilterService` listens for route changes and dispatches the `setFilter` action. The `selectFilteredTodos` selector returns the correct filtered list based on the current filter state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items

    The footer component displays the active item count using the `selectActiveTodoCount` selector. It also correctly formats the text with proper pluralization using the `getActiveTodoText` method.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items

    The "Clear completed" button in the footer component dispatches the `clearCompleted` action when clicked. The button is conditionally displayed only when there are completed items. The reducer correctly filters out completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage

    Persistence is handled by the `StorageService` and the NgRx effects. The `saveTodos$` effect listens for relevant actions and saves the updated todo list to localStorage. The `loadTodos$` effect loads todos from localStorage when the app initializes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation

    The application uses hash-based routing with routes configured for `/all`, `/active`, and `/completed`, maintaining the same URL structure as typical TodoMVC implementations. The routing module includes redirects for unknown routes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states

    The main todo list section is conditionally displayed only when there are todos (`*ngIf="(todos$ | async)?.length"`). Similarly, the footer is only shown when there are todos, and the "Clear completed" button is only shown when there are completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly

    Form submissions are handled properly. The todo input form prevents empty submissions, trims input values, and clears the input after submission. Editing form handles both Escape (cancel) and Enter (save) keys, as well as blur events.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships

    The component structure follows Angular best practices with clear parent-child relationships. The app has a hierarchical structure with `AppComponent` at the root, containing the header, main, and footer components. Each component has well-defined inputs and outputs for communication.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved

    All business logic has been correctly migrated from React to Angular with NgRx. This includes todo management (add, edit, delete, toggle), filtering, persistence, and UI state management. The code maintains the same functionality while following Angular conventions.
