# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The answer specifies a migration to Angular 14.x and the project structure corresponds to a standard Angular application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The code demonstrates use of @ngrx/store (e.g., StoreModule.forRoot with a reducer) for managing state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  The provided code includes NgRx Effects (e.g., TodoEffects) to handle asynchronous tasks like loading and saving todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  Actions, reducers, and selectors are clearly defined and implemented, which supports maintaining a predictable state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  Components in the code are annotated with @Component and correctly use @Input and @Output where necessary.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  React's ref mechanism is replaced with Angular’s @ViewChild in components such as TodoItemComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  The provided code consistently uses @Input for receiving data and @Output with EventEmitter for emitting events.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  Services like UtilsService, StorageService, and RouteFilterService handle data and business logic, following Angular best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  Dependency injection is evident in constructors across components and services (e.g., injecting Store, Router, and StorageService).

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  The code does not explicitly set change detection strategies (such as ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush) on components. While the current implementation functions correctly, using an explicit change detection strategy could further optimize component rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  The AppRoutingModule and the use of routerLink in templates confirm Angular Router is used for navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The project structure, naming conventions, and component/service separation align well with the Angular style guide.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  Interfaces such as Todo, AppState, and the usage of type aliases are consistently maintained across the codebase.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  Templates are provided in Angular HTML format rather than JSX, consistent with Angular’s templating system.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  Event handling is implemented using Angular’s template syntax (e.g., (keydown), (blur), (click)) in place of React event handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  A review of the code shows no TODO comments, implying that the migration is complete.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  The code does not demonstrate the implementation of lazy loading for feature modules. All components and modules are included in the main AppModule rather than being loaded lazily.
