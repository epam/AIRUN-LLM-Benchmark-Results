# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The TodoMainComponent iterates over the list of todos using the filteredTodos$ observable and the TodoItemComponent is used to render each individual todo item.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoHeaderComponent includes an input with an event handler (onKeyDown) that dispatches the addTodo action when the Enter key is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  The TodoItemComponent binds the checkbox input’s change event to emit the toggle event, which is subsequently handled by dispatching the toggleTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent provides an input for editing (rendered conditionally when editing is true) and dispatches save and cancel events via onSubmit and keydown event handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  Both the TodoItemComponent (via the destroy button) and the TodoMainComponent dispatch the deleteTodo action to remove a todo item.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  The TodoMainComponent uses an input checkbox labeled “toggle-all” which dispatches the toggleAllTodos action to mark all todo items as complete or incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  Filtering is implemented via Angular routing in AppRoutingModule and processed by selectors in TodoSelectors that filter todos based on their completed status.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooterComponent selects the activeTodoCount$ from the store and displays it with the pluralized item text.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  A “Clear completed” button in the TodoFooterComponent dispatches the clearCompleted action, which is handled in the reducer to filter out completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  The StorageService along with the NgRx Effects (saveTodos$ effect) handles loading and saving todos to local storage effectively.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The AppRoutingModule is configured with routes for “all”, “active”, and “completed” (using hash-based navigation) to preserve URL structure similar to the original TodoMVC application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  Conditional rendering (e.g., in TodoMainComponent and TodoFooterComponent) ensures that the UI adapts when there are no todo items, aligning with the expected empty state behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  Form submission is effectively managed in the TodoHeaderComponent (by dispatching an addTodo action on Enter key detection) and in the TodoItemComponent (handling edit submission and cancellation).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The application is well-structured with clearly separated components (header, main, item, footer) and services, ensuring proper component communication and dependency injection.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  All core functionalities (adding, editing, deleting, toggling, filtering, and persistence) are implemented using Angular and NgRx, ensuring that the business logic is fully carried over from the original TodoMVC application.
