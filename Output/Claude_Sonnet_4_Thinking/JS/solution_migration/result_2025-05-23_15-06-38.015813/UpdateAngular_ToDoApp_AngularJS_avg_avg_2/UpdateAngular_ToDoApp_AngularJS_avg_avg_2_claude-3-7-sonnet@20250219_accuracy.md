# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The code clearly indicates Angular 14.x usage through the package.json dependencies section which specifies `"@angular/core": "^14.0.0"` and other Angular packages with version 14.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS
  
  The code consistently uses ES module imports (`import { ... } from '...'`) throughout all files, with no RequireJS dependency or `require` calls present.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management
  
  The application properly implements NgRx store with appropriate imports from '@ngrx/store' and Store module integration in the app.module.ts file.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects
  
  NgRx effects are correctly implemented with proper imports from '@ngrx/effects', and the TodoEffects class is defined with appropriate effect handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management
  
  The implementation includes comprehensive todo management with well-defined actions (in todo.actions.ts), reducers (in todo.reducer.ts), selectors (in todo.selectors.ts), and effects (in todo.effects.ts).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator
  
  The TodoStorageService correctly implements the @Injectable decorator with the 'providedIn: root' pattern.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service
  
  The TodoStorageService properly implements localStorage for todo persistence with get() and put() methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators
  
  All components (AppComponent, TodoHeaderComponent, TodoListComponent, TodoItemComponent, TodoFooterComponent) correctly use the @Component decorator with appropriate metadata.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators
  
  Both custom directives (TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective) correctly use the @Directive decorator with appropriate selector metadata.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)
  
  The component templates correctly use Angular template syntax including *ngFor (in TodoListComponent for rendering todos), *ngIf (in multiple components for conditional rendering), and async pipe usage with observables.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))
  
  Event binding is correctly implemented throughout the application with (click), (change), (blur), (ngSubmit), etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])
  
  Property binding is correctly implemented throughout the components using [class.completed], [checked], [appTodoFocus], etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed
  
  Lifecycle hooks are correctly implemented in components, including ngOnInit in AppComponent and TodoItemComponent, ngOnChanges in TodoFocusDirective, and ngOnDestroy in TodoItemComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models
  
  TypeScript interfaces are properly defined for data models, including Todo, TodoState, and TodoFilter enum in todo.model.ts.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services
  
  Dependency injection is correctly implemented throughout the application, with services and Store being injected into components through constructor parameters.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code follows Angular style guide conventions with proper naming (camelCase for properties, PascalCase for classes), component file organization, and consistent formatting.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings
  
  Based on the code provided, there are no obvious sources of console errors or warnings. Error handling is implemented in the TodoStorageService when getting data from localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)
  
  The code correctly uses TypeScript features including interfaces for models, proper typing of variables and parameters, and leveraging TypeScript's type system throughout the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code
  
  The provided code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code sections.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design
  
  The application demonstrates good separation of concerns with components divided by responsibility (header, list, item, footer) and services handling data persistence separately from UI components. The NgRx pattern further enforces this separation with actions, reducers, selectors, and effects having distinct responsibilities.
