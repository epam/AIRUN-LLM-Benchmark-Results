# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The package.json file clearly lists Angular packages with version "^14.0.0", confirming that Angular 14.x is used.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
  All module imports use ES module syntax (e.g., import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';), and there is no sign of RequireJS.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
  The application imports StoreModule and defines the todoReducer; actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented using @ngrx/store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
  The TodoEffects class is provided, importing and using createEffect from @ngrx/effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
  The code includes comprehensive definitions for actions (loadTodos, addTodo, etc.), reducers (handling state changes), selectors, and corresponding effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
  The TodoStorageService is annotated with @Injectable and providedIn: 'root', ensuring proper dependency injection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
  The TodoStorageService uses localStorage to get and set todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
  All components (AppComponent, TodoHeaderComponent, etc.) are correctly decorated with @Component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
  The directives (TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective) are appropriately decorated with @Directive.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
  Templates correctly use structural directives such as *ngFor and *ngIf.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
  Event bindings such as (click) and (ngSubmit) are used properly in the components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
  Property bindings, including [class.completed] and [checked], are correctly implemented in the templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
  Components implement lifecycle hooks like ngOnInit and ngOnDestroy as required, ensuring proper component behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
  The Todo and TodoState interfaces are defined and used throughout the NgRx store implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
  The application consistently uses constructor injection to obtain instances of Store, TodoStorageService, etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code demonstrates good organization, naming conventions, and separation of concerns in line with Angular best practices.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
  Although it is not possible to run the code in this evaluation, the code structure and absence of commented-out debug statements suggest that no console errors or warnings would appear. (The 90% confidence is due to the inability to confirm runtime behavior in this context.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
  The implementation makes effective use of TypeScript features such as type annotations, interfaces, and proper error handling in service methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
  No extraneous TODO comments or commented-out code blocks are present in the provided migration code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows the single responsibility principle in component design  
  Each component and directive handles a specific task (e.g., TodoHeaderComponent for adding todos, TodoItemComponent for displaying and editing a single todo), indicating adherence to the single responsibility principle.
