  The delete functionality is handled in TodoItemComponent by dispatching a delete action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed  
  The TodoItemComponent toggles the completed status via its onToggleComplete method.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)  
  The filtering is achieved through the TodoFooterComponent, which dispatches a filter action and uses selectors accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete  
  The TodoListComponent allows toggling the completion state of all todos via the toggleAllTodos action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos  
  The TodoFooterComponent dispatches an action to clear completed todos and the corresponding effect processes it.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos  
  The activeTodoCount$ selector is used in the TodoFooterComponent to display the remaining todos count.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage  
  The TodoStorageService handles persistence using localStorage via its get and put methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original  
  The updated Angular application preserves the original TodoMVC HTML structure and styling references.  
  (Confidence lowered to 90% because while the HTML and CSS references appear to maintain the appearance, a full visual comparison would require a runtime verification.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately  
  Both the addition of new todos and the editing process trim the input and if empty, either do not add or trigger deletion of the todo.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter  
  The provided code does not implement any mechanism (such as Angular Router integration or URL manipulation) to update the URL when a filter is selected.  
  This behavior, common in the original TodoMVC implementations, is missing in this migration.
