# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
   The provided code includes a `handleNewTodoKeyDown` function in the TodoApp component that adds a new todo when the Enter key is pressed and the input has a valid value.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
   The application properly filters todos using the `selectFilteredTodos` selector based on the current filter state, and it renders them using the TodoItem component within a list.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
   The code includes a `handleToggleAll` function and the corresponding `toggleAllTodos` action that marks all todos as completed or not completed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
   The TodoItem component includes functionality for toggling completion status, editing, and deleting individual todos through the `handleToggle`, `handleEdit`, and `handleDestroy` methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
   The TodoItem component implements a double-click handler (`onDoubleClick={handleEdit}`) on the label element that enables editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
   The TodoItem component includes a `handleKeyDown` function that checks for the Enter key and calls `handleSubmit` to save the edited todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
   The TodoItem component's `handleKeyDown` function handles the Escape key to reset the input field to the original todo value and cancel editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
   The TodoFooter component displays the active item count with proper pluralization: `<strong>{activeCount}</strong> {activeTodoWord} left`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
   The TodoFooter component renders filter links for All, Active, and Completed options that are properly connected to the routing mechanism.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
   The TodoFooter includes a "Clear completed" button that triggers the `handleClearCompleted` function to remove completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
   The code uses `loadFromStorage` and `saveToStorage` functions to retrieve from and persist todos to localStorage with proper error handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
   The application conditionally renders the main section and footer based on whether there are todos (`hasTodos`) and the "Clear completed" button based on whether there are completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
   The application uses a `pluralize` utility function to correctly pluralize text based on count: `const activeTodoWord = pluralize(activeCount, 'item');`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
   The code demonstrates good component composition with separate, focused components like TodoApp, TodoItem, and TodoFooter, each with clear responsibilities.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
   The code is well-organized with a clear structure, separating components, types, utilities, constants, store configuration, selectors, and Redux slices into their respective files.
