# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The new todo input in TodoApp has an onKeyDown handler that listens for the Enter key and dispatches the addTodo action when the input value is not empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The application uses a memoized selector (selectFilteredTodos) and maps over the filtered array to render TodoItem components, ensuring the list displays according to the current filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  A checkbox with class "toggle-all" in TodoApp handles the toggleAllTodos action, thereby providing the functionality to mark all todos as complete or incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  TodoItem implements onToggle, onEdit, and onDestroy callbacks, allowing individual todos to be toggled, edited (via double-click), and deleted.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  The label within TodoItem has an onDoubleClick event handler that triggers handleEdit, which in turn dispatches the appropriate action to set the editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  The keyDown handler in TodoItem listens for the Enter key (via KEYS.ENTER) and, when pressed, calls handleSubmit to dispatch the saveTodo action for the edited todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  In TodoItemâ€™s keyDown handler, pressing Escape (KEYS.ESCAPE) resets the editText state to the original todo title and calls onCancel to exit editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  TodoFooter displays the active count by showing the number of items left, as provided by the activeCount prop, along with correct pluralization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  TodoFooter renders filter links for "All", "Active", and "Completed", enabling the user to change the current filter state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  A button labeled "Clear completed" is conditionally rendered in TodoFooter when completedCount is greater than zero, and it is linked to the onClearCompleted handler.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  The Redux slice in combination with utility functions (saveToStorage and loadFromStorage) ensures todos are persisted to localStorage after modifications.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  TodoApp conditionally renders the main section and footer based on whether there are todos present, ensuring only relevant UI elements are displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  The pluralize utility function in TodoFooter checks the active todo count and returns "item" or "items" accordingly, ensuring correct text display.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The code base is modularized into focused components (e.g., TodoApp, TodoItem, TodoFooter) and supporting utilities, reflecting good composition practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The file structure organizes code into directories such as src/components, src/store, src/types, and src/constants, which clearly delineates different functionalities.
