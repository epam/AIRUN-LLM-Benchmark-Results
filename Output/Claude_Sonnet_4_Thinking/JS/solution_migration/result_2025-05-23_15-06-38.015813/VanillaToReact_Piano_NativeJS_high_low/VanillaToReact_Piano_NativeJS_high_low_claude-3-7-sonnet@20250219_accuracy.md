# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration
  
  The application is clearly configured with React 18 and TypeScript, as evidenced by the setup instructions showing `npx create-react-app virtual-piano --template typescript` and the import statements in index.tsx: `import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'` which is specific to React 18's concurrent features.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure
  
  The answer includes well-defined TypeScript interfaces in the `piano.types.ts` file, including:
  ```typescript
  export interface AudioMapper {
    [key: string]: HTMLAudioElement;
  }
  ```
  This interface is properly used in the audio utility functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks

  All components in the solution (Header, ButtonContainer, PianoKey, Piano, Footer, and App) are implemented as functional components with React hooks. None use class components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)

  The code properly uses React hooks for state management:
  - `useState` for managing active keys: `const [activeKeys, setActiveKeys] = useState<Set<Note>>(new Set());`
  - `useState` for display mode: `const [displayMode, setDisplayMode] = useState<DisplayMode>('notes');`
  - `useEffect` for event listeners in hooks like `useKeyboard` and `useFullscreen`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels

  Keyboard event handling is appropriately implemented in the `useKeyboard` custom hook which is consumed by the Piano component. The event listeners are properly attached and removed with useEffect, and the key events are correctly mapped to the piano keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events

  The PianoKey component correctly implements mouse interactions using React synthetic events:
  ```typescript
  onMouseDown={handleMouseDown}
  onMouseUp={handleMouseUp}
  onMouseLeave={handleMouseLeave}
  onMouseMove={handleMouseMove}
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment

  Audio resources are managed correctly through the `useAudio` custom hook, which manages audio elements in a ref to prevent unnecessary re-renders. The implementation properly handles audio playback and resets.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility

  The fullscreen functionality is properly implemented in the `useFullscreen` hook, which correctly handles browser APIs like `requestFullscreen` and `exitFullscreen`, along with the appropriate event listeners for fullscreen state changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns

  Conditional class application follows React patterns throughout the code:
  ```typescript
  // Example from PianoKey.tsx
  const keyClasses = [
    styles.pianoKey,
    keyData.isSharp ? styles.sharp : '',
    isActive ? styles.pianoKeyActive : ''
  ].filter(Boolean).join(' ');
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate

  React.memo is appropriately used in simpler components like Header, ButtonContainer, and Footer to prevent unnecessary re-renders. The PianoKey component also uses React.memo with appropriate dependency arrays in useCallback hooks.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations

  Audio playback is handled with proper lifecycle considerations:
  - Audio elements are created once and stored in a ref
  - The playSound function is memoized with useCallback
  - Audio elements are reused rather than created on each playback
  
  This approach prevents memory leaks and ensures efficient audio handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application

  The code consistently uses TypeScript typing throughout the application, including:
  - Explicitly typed state variables: `useState<DisplayMode>('notes')`
  - Properly typed component props: `React.FC<PianoKeyProps>`
  - Well-defined type exports: `export type Note = 'c' | 'd' | ...`
  - Type guards where needed
