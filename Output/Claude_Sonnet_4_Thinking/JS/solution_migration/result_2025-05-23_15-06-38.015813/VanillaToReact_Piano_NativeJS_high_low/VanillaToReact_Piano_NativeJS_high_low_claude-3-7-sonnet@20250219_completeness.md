  The ButtonContainer component in `ButtonContainer.tsx` includes buttons for 'Notes' and 'Letters' with proper state management for toggling between the display modes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)
  
  The Piano component in `Piano.tsx` renders all piano keys using the pianoKeysData and sharpKeysData from the audioMapper utility, and it also handles special cases like the absence of sharps between certain natural keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes
  
  Each PianoKey component includes data attributes for both letter and note: `data-letter={keyData.letter}` and `data-note={keyData.note}`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked
  
  The useAudio hook creates audio elements for each note, and the playSound function is called when a key is pressed, ensuring that the correct audio is played for each piano key.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)
  
  The PianoKey component applies a dynamic CSS class based on the isActive prop, which is controlled by the activeKeys state in the Piano component. The `.pianoKeyActive` class is applied when a key is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes
  
  The useKeyboard hook registers keyboard events and maps them to the appropriate piano keys, allowing users to play notes using their keyboard.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked
