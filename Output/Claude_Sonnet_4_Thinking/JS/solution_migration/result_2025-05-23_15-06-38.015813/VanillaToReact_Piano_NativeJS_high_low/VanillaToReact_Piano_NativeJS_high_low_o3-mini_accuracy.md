# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration  
  The provided implementation uses the modern React 18 API (e.g., ReactDOM.createRoot) and sets up the project with TypeScript, consistent with Create React App's template.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure  
  The code defines TypeScript types and interfaces (such as AudioMapper, Note, and PianoKeyData) and uses them appropriately in the audioMapper and other components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks  
  Each component is implemented as a functional component using React.FC, and hooks are extensively used for state management and side effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)  
  The application uses useState for managing active keys and useEffect in hooks (useKeyboard, useFullscreen) which is appropriate for UI state and lifecycle management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels  
  The useKeyboard hook attaches keyboard event listeners at the document level, correctly handling keydown and keyup events.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events  
  Mouse events in the PianoKey component (onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseLeave, and onMouseMove) are implemented using Reactâ€™s synthetic event system.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment  
  The useAudio hook creates and stores Audio objects for each note, resets the playback time, and handles promise rejections, which is appropriate for the React environment.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility  
  The useFullscreen hook uses React's useCallback and useEffect to manage fullscreen toggling, calling the appropriate methods (requestFullscreen and exitFullscreen) reliably.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns  
  Conditional classes in the PianoKey and ButtonContainer components are applied by combining CSS modules classes in a performant and readable manner.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate  
  Several components (e.g., Header, ButtonContainer, Footer, and PianoKey) are wrapped with React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations  
  The playSound function resets the audio playback time and starts the sound, and it is encapsulated within a custom hook that respects React lifecycle events.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application  
  The entire codebase uses strict TypeScript typing, including interfaces, types, and functional component props, ensuring strong type safety.
