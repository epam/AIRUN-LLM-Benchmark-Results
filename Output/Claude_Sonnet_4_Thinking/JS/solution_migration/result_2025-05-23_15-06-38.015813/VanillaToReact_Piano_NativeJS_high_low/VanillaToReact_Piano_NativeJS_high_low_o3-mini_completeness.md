# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'  
  The Header component renders an h1 element with the title "Virtual Piano". This aligns with the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons  
  The ButtonContainer component renders two buttons labeled "Notes" and "Letters", and their active state is toggled based on the display mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)  
  The Piano component maps over the pianoKeysData and sharpKeysData arrays to render all natural and sharp keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes  
  The PianoKey component includes data attributes (data-letter and data-note) for each key, providing the required metadata.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked  
  The useAudio hook retrieves the correct audio object from the created audio mapper and plays it upon key activation.  
  Note: Confidence is at 90% because while the implementation appears solid, minor issues (such as handling promise rejections or audio loading failures more robustly) could affect behavior in edge cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)  
  Active keys are tracked using state, and the PianoKey component applies an active CSS class when the key is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes  
  The useKeyboard hook integrates with the Piano component to handle keydown and keyup events, mapping them correctly to piano keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked  
  The display mode toggles correctly via the ButtonContainer and is passed down to the Piano and PianoKey components, affecting the displayed text.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes  
  The App component includes a fullscreen toggle button that uses the useFullscreen hook, enabling and exiting fullscreen as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly  
  The Piano component uses a Set to manage active keys and supports multiple simultaneous active keys by adding to and removing from the set appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys  
  The PianoKey component implements onMouseMove (with a check for mouse button pressed) along with onMouseDown and onMouseUp events, handling mouse drags between keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information  
  The Footer component renders a footer containing the text "2020", meeting the requirements for footer content.
