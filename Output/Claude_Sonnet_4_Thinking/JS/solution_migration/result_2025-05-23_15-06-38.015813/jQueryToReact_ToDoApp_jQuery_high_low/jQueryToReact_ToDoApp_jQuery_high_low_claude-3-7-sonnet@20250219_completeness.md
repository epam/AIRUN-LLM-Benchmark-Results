  The `TodoList.tsx` component includes a main section with the id "main" and className "main", containing a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos rendered through the `TodoItem` component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)

  The `TodoList.tsx` component includes a toggle-all checkbox that dispatches the `toggleAllTodos` action when clicked, updating the completion status of all todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management  
  The `TodoItem.tsx` component includes editing functionality that sets focus on the edit input when entering edit mode, and includes keyboard event handlers for Enter (to save) and Escape (to cancel).
