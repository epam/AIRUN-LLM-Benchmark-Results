# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18.x  
  The package.json specifies "react": "^18.2.0" and "react-dom": "^18.2.0", which confirms the application is built with React 18.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript for type safety  
  All source files use the .tsx/.ts extensions and TypeScript interfaces/types are defined, indicating the use of TypeScript.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for state management  
  The state management is implemented with Redux Toolkitâ€™s createSlice (in src/store/todoSlice.ts).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm nanoid is used for generating unique IDs  
  The nanoid function is imported and utilized to generate unique identifiers for todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code uses functional components with hooks instead of class components  
  All components are written as functional components using hooks such as useState, useEffect, and custom Redux hooks.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains the same routing functionality with proper route handling  
  The app uses HashRouter with <Routes> and <Route> components to manage filtering routes ("/all", "/active", "/completed"), matching the original routing functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Redux store is properly configured with appropriate slices  
  The Redux store is set up in src/store/index.ts with the todoReducer, confirming proper store configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the Redux provider is set up in the application entry point  
  The Provider from react-redux wraps the application in App.tsx, ensuring Redux is properly integrated.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for all data structures  
  The Todo interface and FilterType are defined in src/types/Todo.ts, and type definitions are consistently used across the project.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows React best practices for component composition  
  The code is modularized into clear components with well-defined responsibilities and uses hooks appropriately, following common React best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles keyboard events properly (Enter key for creating/updating todos, Escape key for canceling edits)  
  The TodoInput and TodoItem components implement onKeyUp event handlers that check for the Enter and Escape keys to trigger actions as required.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application maintains local storage persistence if implemented  
  The application reads from and writes to localStorage (using try-catch blocks in loadTodosFromStorage and saveTodosToStorage), preserving todo data across sessions.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  The provided code appears syntactically correct and adheres to standard practices. While no console errors or warnings are evident in the static review, actual runtime testing would be required to confirm this with absolute certainty.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the application implements proper error handling  
  Error handling is seen in operations interacting with localStorage (using try-catch), though more comprehensive error boundaries could be added in a production scenario. This minimal error handling meets the basic requirements.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the code is optimized with no unnecessary re-renders  
  The components are functionally decomposed and make effective use of hooks. Although explicit performance optimizations (e.g., memoization) are not visible, there are no obvious unnecessary re-renders from the code review. Runtime profiling would be needed for full confirmation.
