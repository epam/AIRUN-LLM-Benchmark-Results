# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Vite is configured as the build tool with appropriate configuration files  
  The provided project includes a vite.config.ts with proper plugin configuration and build settings, and the package.json scripts utilize Vite commands.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm TypeScript is properly configured with a tsconfig.json file containing correct compiler options  
  The tsconfig.json and tsconfig.node.json files are present and include modern, strict settings and appropriate module resolution options.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the React setup includes necessary entry points and proper component structure  
  The project features standard React entry points such as main.tsx and App.tsx, a clear hierarchy for components, pages, and assets.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that Redux is implemented with appropriate store configuration, reducers, and actions  
  A Redux store is set up with slices (e.g., counterSlice), and actions (increment, decrement, incrementByAmount) are defined and used correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify React Router is correctly configured with defined routes and navigation components  
  The App.tsx file defines routes for Home, About, and a 404 Not Found page using react-router-dom, and navigation links are properly implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure testing libraries are properly configured with appropriate test setup files  
  The project includes tests utilizing Vitest alongside React Testing Library, with a setup file (tests/setup.ts) for jest-dom and proper test configurations in vite.config.ts.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate package.json includes correct dependencies with compatible version specifications  
  The package.json lists necessary dependencies and devDependencies with modern versions for React, TypeScript, ESLint, Vitest, and related libraries.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm package.json contains scripts for development, building, and testing operations  
  All required scripts are present in the package.json, covering development (npm run dev), production builds, testing, linting, type-checking, and formatting.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the project structure follows modern React development conventions  
  The structure is organized into clear directories for components, pages, store, types, and utils; tests and configuration files are also well placed.

- **Pass** (90%): Check that configuration files are production-ready with appropriate optimization settings  
  The vite.config.ts includes a build configuration with output directory and sourcemap enabled. While the settings are generally production-ready, further optimization details (such as advanced caching or code-splitting configurations) could be considered. However, based on typical project requirements, the provided configuration is sufficient.
