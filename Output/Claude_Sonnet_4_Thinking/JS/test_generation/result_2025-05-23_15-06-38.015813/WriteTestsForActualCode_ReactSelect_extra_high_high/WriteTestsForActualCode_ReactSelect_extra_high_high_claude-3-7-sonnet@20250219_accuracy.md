# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up in the test file

    The code correctly sets up Jest and React Testing Library with appropriate configuration in the `jest.config.js` file and `setupTests.ts` file. The imports in the test files include the required testing utilities:

    ```javascript
    import { screen, fireEvent, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
    import { render, RenderOptions } from '@testing-library/react';
    import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';
    ```

    The setup also includes custom render functions and proper mock configurations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test cases are properly isolated and do not have interdependencies

    The test cases use `beforeEach(() => { jest.clearAllMocks(); })` to reset mock state between tests. Each test case uses a fresh render of the component with its own set of props and doesn't depend on state from previous tests. Tests are logically grouped into describe blocks, and each test addresses a specific isolated behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that DOM events are simulated using proper React Testing Library methods

    The code correctly uses React Testing Library's user event API for most interactions:
    
    ```javascript
    const { user } = renderSelect(...);
    await user.click(element);
    await user.type(input, 'test');
    await user.keyboard(`{${keyboard.arrowDown}}`);
    ```
    
    The code also properly uses `fireEvent` for certain events that are not covered by user-event:
    
    ```javascript
    fireEvent.touchEnd(control);
    fireEvent.scroll(document);
    fireEvent.compositionStart(document);
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that accessibility attributes are being tested appropriately

    The code includes a dedicated "Accessibility" describe block that tests ARIA attributes:
    
    ```javascript
    expect(input).toHaveAttribute('role', 'combobox');
    expect(input).toHaveAttribute('aria-autocomplete', 'list');
    expect(input).toHaveAttribute('aria-expanded', 'false');
    ```
    
    It also tests the presence of live regions and custom aria-labels.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure mocks are used for external dependencies where appropriate

    The code includes comprehensive mocking of external dependencies in the `selectMocks.ts` file:
    
    ```javascript
    export const mockCreateFilter = jest.fn(() => jest.fn(() => true));
    export const mockUtils = { ... };
    export const mockBuiltins = { ... };
    export const mockDefaultComponents = jest.fn(() => ({ ... }));
    
    jest.mock('../filters', () => ({
      createFilter: mockCreateFilter,
    }));
    jest.mock('../utils', () => mockUtils);
    ```
    
    These mocks are used consistently throughout the tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of async/await for asynchronous testing where needed

    All user interactions that might cause asynchronous updates are properly awaited:
    
    ```javascript
    await user.click(option);
    await user.type(input, 'test');
    await user.keyboard(`{${keyboard.arrowDown}}`);
    ```
    
    The code also uses `waitFor` when needed for asynchronous assertions.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all assertions use appropriate Jest matchers

    The code uses appropriate Jest matchers throughout:
    
    ```javascript
    expect(screen.getByTestId('select-container')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(container).toHaveClass('custom-select');
    expect(input).toHaveAttribute('aria-label', 'Custom select');
    expect(onChange).toHaveBeenCalledWith(...);
    expect(renderTime).toBeLessThan(100);
    expect(screen.getAllByTestId('multi-value')).toHaveLength(2);
    ```
    
    These matchers are specific to the assertions being made and verify the correct behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that tests include proper cleanup after each test case

    The test suite uses `beforeEach(() => { jest.clearAllMocks(); })` to reset mock state between tests. Additionally, React Testing Library's render function automatically handles cleanup of rendered components. The code also includes a dedicated test to verify that unmounting works properly without throwing errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test descriptions clearly indicate what functionality is being tested

    The test descriptions are clear and specific about what is being tested:
    
    ```javascript
    it('displays selected single value', () => { ... });
    it('calls onChange when selecting an option', async () => { ... });
    it('opens menu on control click when openMenuOnClick is true', async () => { ... });
    it('renders loading indicator when isLoading is true', () => { ... });
    ```
    
    Each test's purpose is immediately clear from its description.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the test file follows best practices for organizing test cases (describe/it blocks)

    The tests are well-organized into logical groupings using describe blocks:
    
    ```javascript
    describe('Basic Rendering', () => { ... });
    describe('Single Value Selection', () => { ... });
    describe('Multi Value Selection', () => { ... });
    describe('Menu Behavior', () => { ... });
    ```
    
    This organization makes it easy to find specific tests and understand the overall test coverage.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that all event handlers are tested using appropriate simulation methods

    The code verifies all event handlers by simulating the appropriate events and checking that the handlers are called:
    
    ```javascript
    const onChange = jest.fn();
    // ...
    await user.click(option);
    expect(onChange).toHaveBeenCalledWith(...);
    ```
    
    It tests clicks, key presses, focus events, and other interactions by simulating them and verifying the expected callbacks are called with the correct arguments.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the test environment correctly simulates both mouse and keyboard interactions

    The code simulates mouse interactions:
    
    ```javascript
    await user.click(element);
    ```
    
    And keyboard interactions:
    
    ```javascript
    await user.keyboard(`{${keyboard.arrowDown}}`);
    await user.keyboard(`{${keyboard.enter}}`);
    await user.keyboard(`{${keyboard.escape}}`);
    ```
    
    It properly tests the component's responses to these different types of interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for touch events properly simulate mobile interactions

    The code properly tests touch events using fireEvent:
    
    ```javascript
    fireEvent.touchEnd(control);
    expect(onMenuOpen).toHaveBeenCalled();
    
    fireEvent.touchEnd(clearButton);
    expect(onChange).toHaveBeenCalledWith(null, expect.objectContaining({ action: 'clear' }));
    ```
    
    These tests properly simulate mobile interactions with the component.
