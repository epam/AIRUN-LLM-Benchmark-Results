# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist
  
  The submission includes comprehensive tests for basic component rendering with default props in the `Basic Rendering` section of the test suite. The test `renders with default props` explicitly checks that essential components like select-container, control, value-container, and input are rendered correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present
  
  The submission includes a dedicated `Keyboard Navigation` section that thoroughly tests keyboard interaction including arrow keys (ArrowDown, ArrowUp, ArrowLeft, ArrowRight), Enter for selection, and Escape for closing the menu. Tests like `opens menu with ArrowDown when menu is closed` and `selects focused option with Enter key` demonstrate this coverage.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)
  
  The test suite includes multiple tests for mouse interactions throughout the test file. Examples include clicking on the control to open the menu, clicking on options to select them, and clicking outside to close the menu. Tests such as `calls onChange when selecting an option` verify these interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior
  
  The test suite covers both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior by testing the component with explicitly provided values (controlled) and testing default behaviors. The tests for value selection, input changes, and menu state management demonstrate this coverage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values
  
  There are comprehensive tests for these state changes, including `calls onChange when selecting an option`, `removes option when clicking selected option in multi mode`, and `clears value when clicking clear indicator` which verify the expected behavior when selecting, removing, and clearing values.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented
  
  The `Menu Behavior` section of the test suite covers various scenarios for opening and closing the menu, including clicking the control, focusing input, clicking outside, and keyboard interactions. Tests like `opens menu on control click when openMenuOnClick is true` and `closes menu when clicking outside` demonstrate this coverage.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality
  
  The `Search and Filtering` section includes tests for input changes during search, menu opening on typing, and the rendering of components when the component is not searchable. Tests like `calls onInputChange when typing in search` verify the filtering functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist
  
  The test suite includes a dedicated `Multi Value Selection` section that covers displaying multiple selected values, adding options to selection in multi-mode, and removing options from multi-selection. Tests like `adds option to selection in multi mode` verify this behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility
  
  The `Accessibility` section tests for proper ARIA attributes, including role, aria-autocomplete, aria-expanded, and custom aria-label. It also verifies that a live region for screen readers is rendered and that aria-expanded updates when the menu opens.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested
  
  The test suite includes both a `No Options Message` section that tests rendering with empty options arrays and a dedicated `Select.edge-cases.test.tsx` file that covers scenarios like null options, undefined values, missing labels, and extremely long option labels.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states
  
  The `Loading States` section tests rendering the loading indicator when isLoading is true and rendering a loading message in the menu when both isLoading and menuIsOpen. The Error Handling section tests disabled options and empty input values.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states
  
  The test suite includes tests for disabled states in multiple sections, including `renders as disabled when isDisabled prop is true` in the Basic Rendering section and `handles disabled options correctly` in the Error Handling section.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance
  
  The submission includes a dedicated `Select.performance.test.tsx` file with performance tests that verify the component renders efficiently with large option sets (1000 options) and handles rapid value changes efficiently.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested
  
  Focus management tests are included for keyboard navigation and interaction. Tests like `navigates multi-value with left/right arrows` verify that focus moves correctly between values, and other tests verify focus behavior during menu navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering
  
  The test suite includes tests for placeholder rendering (`renders placeholder when no value is selected`) and value rendering for both single and multi-select modes (`displays selected single value` and `displays multiple selected values`).

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations
  
  While the test suite extensively tests option rendering and selection, it doesn't explicitly test a custom formatOptionLabel function. However, it does test related functionality like getOptionLabel and formatGroupLabel with custom implementations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)
  
  The test suite comprehensively tests all the callback functions mentioned, including onChange when selecting options, onInputChange when typing in search, onMenuOpen when opening the menu through various interactions, and onMenuClose when closing the menu.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)
  
  The test suite includes tests for all indicator components, including rendering and interaction with the clear indicator, dropdown indicator, and loading indicator. Tests like `renders clear indicator when value exists and isClearable` verify this functionality.
