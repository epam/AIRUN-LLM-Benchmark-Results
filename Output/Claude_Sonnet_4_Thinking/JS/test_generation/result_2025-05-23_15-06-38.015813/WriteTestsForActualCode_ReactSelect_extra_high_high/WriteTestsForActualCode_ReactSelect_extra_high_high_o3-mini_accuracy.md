# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up in the test file  
  The provided test files import Jest, React Testing Library functions, and a proper Jest configuration is included (e.g., jest.config.js). This setup ensures that the tests run in a simulated browser environment (jsdom).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test cases are properly isolated and do not have interdependencies  
  Each test suite uses separate describe/it blocks and resets mocks via beforeEach. This isolation reduces the risk of interdependencies between tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that DOM events are simulated using proper React Testing Library methods  
  User interactions such as clicks, keyboard events, and touch events are simulated using userEvent and fireEvent from React Testing Library, ensuring proper event simulation.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that accessibility attributes are being tested appropriately  
  The tests explicitly validate ARIA attributes (e.g., role, aria-expanded, aria-label) and ensure the live region is in the document, conforming to accessibility best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure mocks are used for external dependencies where appropriate  
  Mocks are consistently applied for external dependencies (e.g., IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver, and various module imports via jest.mock), which helps isolate component behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of async/await for asynchronous testing where needed  
  Tests that involve asynchronous operations (e.g., simulating user clicks or keyboard events) properly use async/await to ensure events complete before assertions are made.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all assertions use appropriate Jest matchers  
  Assertions make use of matchers like toBeInTheDocument, toHaveAttribute, toHaveClass, objectContaining, and arrayContaining, which are appropriate for validating component behaviors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that tests include proper cleanup after each test case  
  The tests use beforeEach to clear mocks, and in one case, an unmount function is called to ensure that component cleanup occurs without throwing errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test descriptions clearly indicate what functionality is being tested  
  Each test case is clearly described in the describe/it blocks, specifying the intended behavior (e.g., “opens menu on control click” or “handles null options gracefully”).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the test file follows best practices for organizing test cases (describe/it blocks)  
  Test cases are well organized with nested describe blocks, promoting readability and maintainability.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that all event handlers are tested using appropriate simulation methods  
  Event handlers (clicks, keyboard events, touch events, composition events) are simulated using the correct methods, enabling realistic user interaction modeling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the test environment correctly simulates both mouse and keyboard interactions  
  The tests explicitly simulate mouse interactions with userEvent.click and fireEvent, as well as keyboard interactions using user.keyboard, ensuring comprehensive event simulation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for touch events properly simulate mobile interactions  
  Touch events are simulated using fireEvent.touchEnd on relevant elements (e.g., control and clear indicator), which matches expected mobile interaction patterns.
