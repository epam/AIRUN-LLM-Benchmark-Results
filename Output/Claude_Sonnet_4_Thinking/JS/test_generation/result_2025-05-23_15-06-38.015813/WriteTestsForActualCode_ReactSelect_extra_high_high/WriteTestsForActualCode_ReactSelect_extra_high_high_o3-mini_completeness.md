# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist.  
   The test suite includes a "Basic Rendering" section that verifies the component renders with default props, displaying the select container, control, value container, and input.

2. **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present.  
   The "Keyboard Navigation" section covers navigation using arrow keys, Enter, and Escape; although there is no explicit test for the Tab key, the major keyboard paths are well tested.

3. **Pass** (90%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering).  
   Tests for mouse interactions are present (e.g., clicking on options, clear indicator, and control) but there is no explicit test for hover events. The absence of hover-specific tests reduces the confidence slightly.

4. **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior.  
   There are tests that provide a value and onChange (controlled behavior) and tests that handle undefined or null values (suggesting uncontrolled behavior).

5. **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values.  
   The suite includes tests for selecting options (single/multiple), removing options, and clearing values using the clear indicator.

6. **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented.  
   The "Menu Behavior" section contains multiple tests that simulate opening the menu (via control click, input focus, and keyboard events) and closing it (via clicking outside, selecting/clearing options, or pressing Escape).

7. **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality.  
   The "Search and Filtering" section tests that typing in the search input triggers onInputChange and opens the menu when appropriate.

8. **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist.  
   There is a dedicated "Multi Value Selection" section that tests rendering of multiple selected values and interactions specific to multi-select scenarios.

9. **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility.  
   The "Accessibility" section checks for proper ARIA attributes (like role, aria-autocomplete, aria-expanded) and verifies that the live region and custom aria-label are rendered.

10. **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested.  
    The "Edge Cases" section in the Select.edge-cases.test.tsx file includes tests for null options, undefined values, missing labels, and extremely long labels.

11. **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states.  
    The "Loading States" and "Error Handling" sections test the display of loading indicators/messages and the behavior when disabled options are encountered.

12. **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states.  
    The test "handles disabled options correctly" in the Error Handling section ensures that disabled options do not trigger an onChange event.

13. **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance.  
    The performance test file (Select.performance.test.tsx) includes tests that render large option sets and rapid value changes, with performance thresholds in place.

14. **Pass** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested.  
    Several tests in the Keyboard Navigation section verify focus management (e.g., navigating multi-values with left/right arrows, ensuring the control retains focus).

15. **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering.  
    The test suite includes tests that explicitly check for proper rendering of placeholders and selected values in both single and multi-select modes.

16. **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations.  
    There are no explicit tests that verify the behavior of a custom formatOptionLabel function; while several mocks and default implementations exist, the test suite does not validate custom formatting of option labels.

17. **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose).  
    Multiple tests validate that the appropriate callback functions are called with expected arguments during various interactions.

18. **Fail** (90%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading).  
    While tests exist for the clear and loading indicators, there is no explicit test verifying the rendering or behavior of the dropdown indicator. This omission results in a Fail for this step. The 90% confidence is due to the possibility that the dropdown indicatorâ€™s behavior might be indirectly covered via overall rendering, though not explicitly asserted.
