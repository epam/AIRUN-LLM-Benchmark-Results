# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)
    
    The tests are configured to use Jasmine with Karma as the test runner. This is evident from the karma.conf.js file configuration where 'jasmine' is explicitly listed in the frameworks array.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints
    
    The tests properly mock the $resource service and REST API endpoints. For example, in the REST Factory tests, there are explicit mocks of $httpBackend to intercept and respond to HTTP requests, and in the controller tests, REST methods like REST.content.save, REST.contentRevisions.save, etc. are mocked using jasmine.createSpy().

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation
    
    The tests consistently use beforeEach hooks to set up test environments, reset factories, and configure mocks. For example, in the REST Factory tests, afterEach hooks verify no outstanding expectations or requests remain, ensuring proper cleanup.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls
    
    All HTTP requests are properly mocked using $httpBackend in the REST Factory tests and spy objects in controller tests. For example, REST.content.save is mocked to return predefined responses rather than making real API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection
    
    The tests correctly use AngularJS's dependency injection. For example, in beforeEach blocks, dependencies like _$controller_, _$rootScope_, _REST_, _Page_, etc. are injected with proper underscores to handle minification.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations
    
    Promises and asynchronous operations are handled appropriately. The tests use $q for creating deferred objects, flush $httpBackend expectations, and call $scope.$apply() when needed to resolve promises in controller tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies
    
    The tests make excellent use of Jasmine spies to mock external dependencies. For example, functions like REST.content.save, $rootScope.$broadcast, and $location.path are spied upon to track calls and provide mock implementations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization
    
    All tests follow the describe/it pattern with clear hierarchical organization. For example, "Page Controller - Save Functions" > "savePage function - Update Existing Page" provides a clear structure of what is being tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls
    
    The tests comprehensively cover both success and error scenarios. For example, in the pageCtrl-save.spec.js file, there are dedicated tests for handling save errors and update errors using the error callback.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate
    
    The tests properly simulate user interactions where needed. For example, they simulate user input by setting values on $scope.page and then triggering functions like titleChange(), which would normally respond to user typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage
    
    Tests properly clean up state to prevent leakage between tests. The beforeEach blocks reset factories and clear localStorage, and afterEach blocks in REST Factory tests verify no outstanding HTTP expectations remain.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested
    
    The test names are clear and descriptive, explaining precisely what is being tested. For example, "should auto-generate URL when no URL exists" clearly indicates the functionality under test.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible
    
    The tests appropriately focus on validating function outputs and behavior rather than implementation details. For example, they check that save operations call the right API endpoints with the correct data, without being overly specific about internal implementation.
