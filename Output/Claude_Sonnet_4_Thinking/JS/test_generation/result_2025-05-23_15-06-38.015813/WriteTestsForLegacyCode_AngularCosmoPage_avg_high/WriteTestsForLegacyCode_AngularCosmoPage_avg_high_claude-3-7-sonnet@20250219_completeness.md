# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources
  
  The REST factory tests are comprehensive and thorough in `test/rest.spec.js`. The tests verify all required resources are defined (`blocks`, `blocksRequirements`, `comments`, `content`, etc.), test HTTP methods (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE), verify URL parameter substitution, and include error handling tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly
  
  The Page factory tests in `test/page.spec.js` thoroughly verify initialization of all properties with default values, including `id`, `title`, `description`, `header`, `subheader`, `body`, `url`, `type`, `published`, etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly
  
  The Users factory tests in `test/users.spec.js` comprehensively validate that all properties (`id`, `username`, `name`, `bio`, `email`, `facebook`, `twitter`, `photo`, `role`) initialize with correct default values.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods
  
  Multiple test files (`pageCtrl.spec.js`, `pageCtrl-advanced.spec.js`, `pageCtrl-save.spec.js`) provide extensive coverage of all public methods in the pageCtrl controller. Tests cover initialization, saving, updating, deleting, and various helper functions like titleChange, urlChange, autocompleteTags, etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller
  
  The tests in the "Initialization" describe block in `pageCtrl.spec.js` properly verify that the controller initializes scope variables correctly, sets default schedule dates for new pages, uses existing schedule dates if available, and sets page type correctly based on available options.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation
  
  Tests for the titleChange function in `pageCtrl-advanced.spec.js` verify that URLs are auto-generated for new pages, handle punctuation in titles correctly, and don't auto-generate URLs for existing pages with custom URLs.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction
  
  The `saveLocal` function tests verify that page data is saved to the Page factory and to localStorage, with checks for different property types including title, description, URL, publish status, etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality
  
  Tests for the autocompleteTags function verify that it queries for tag suggestions, sets suggestions from query results, clears suggestions when no tag is found, and handles the case when no tags exist.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)
  
  The tests in `pageCtrl-save.spec.js` thoroughly cover all conditional branches of the savePage function, including new page creation, validation logic, handling of duplicate URLs, and updating existing pages.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types
  
  Tests verify handling of edge cases such as empty URLs, "new" as a URL (which should be rejected), empty page types, and using header as title when title is empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly
  
  The deletePage function tests in `pageCtrl-advanced.spec.js` verify that page content is deleted correctly, related data (revisions, extras, tags) is also deleted, redirection to a new page occurs after deletion, and success notifications are broadcast.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions
  
  Tests verify both the detection of newer versions in localStorage and the restoration of these versions. The `localVersion` and `deleteNewerVersion` functions are thoroughly tested to ensure they handle localStorage interactions correctly.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components
  
  The tests appear comprehensive and cover all major components and functions. While exact coverage metrics aren't visible, the thoroughness of the tests suggests coverage well above 80%. There is testing for initialization, validation, state changes, error cases, and success paths for all components. The only uncertainty is whether there might be some minor conditional branches or edge cases not explicitly tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling
  
  Tests verify event broadcasting and handling, including broadcasting of 'notify' events with appropriate messages, 'contentGet' events, and 'settingsGet' events. They also verify that the controller correctly responds to these events.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality
  
  The "Schedule Date Logic" tests in `pageCtrl-save.spec.js` thoroughly verify date handling, including keeping existing published dates, setting current time when publishing for the first time, handling scheduled publishing in the future, and publishing immediately when the scheduled date is in the past.
