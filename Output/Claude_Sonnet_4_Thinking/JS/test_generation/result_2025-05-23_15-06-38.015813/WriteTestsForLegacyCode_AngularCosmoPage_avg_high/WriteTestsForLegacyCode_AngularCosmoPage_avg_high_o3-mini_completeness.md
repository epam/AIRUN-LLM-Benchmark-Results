# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources  
  The test file (test/rest.spec.js) includes resource configuration tests for all expected resources (blocks, blocksRequirements, comments, content, etc.), as well as HTTP method tests for GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly  
  The test file (test/page.spec.js) covers the initialization of all required properties with their default values and checks object sharing across injections.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly  
  The test file (test/users.spec.js) verifies that each property (id, username, name, bio, etc.) is defined with proper initial values and validates shared object behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods  
  Multiple test files (e.g., test/pageCtrl.spec.js, test/pageCtrl-advanced.spec.js, test/pageCtrl-save.spec.js) provide extensive coverage for the controller's public methods, including CRUD operations, event handling, and utility functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller  
  The “Initialization” describe blocks in the pageCtrl test files check for correct initialization of the page variable, schedule date defaults, and type selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation  
  The tests for titleChange are detailed, checking auto-generation from the title, handling of punctuation, and ensuring existing custom URLs are not overwritten.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction  
  Tests in the pageCtrl controller verify that saveLocal correctly updates the Page factory and sets values into localStorage, including clearing keys once restored.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality  
  The tests validate that REST.contentTags.query is called correctly based on tag input and that suggestions are set or cleared as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)  
  The extensive set of tests for savePage in test/pageCtrl-save.spec.js confirms that new page creation, duplicate URL checks, updates, and error scenarios are fully tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types  
  Several tests check for missing page type selection and invalid or empty URLs, ensuring proper error notifications are broadcasted.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly  
  The deletion functionality is well-covered with tests that confirm deletion of the page content, related revisions, extras, and subsequent redirection and notifications.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions  
  The tests for “Local Storage Version Detection,” localVersion, and deleteNewerVersion functions ensure that version differences are correctly detected and managed via localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components  
  The provided test suite summary indicates 100% function coverage and 85%+ line coverage, meeting the minimum requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling  
  The tests include numerous checks for $broadcast events (such as 'notify', 'contentGet', and 'settingsGet') confirming that event handling works as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality  
  Tests verify that the scheduling logic correctly handles new pages, existing publish dates, and scenarios where the scheduled publish date is in the past or future.
