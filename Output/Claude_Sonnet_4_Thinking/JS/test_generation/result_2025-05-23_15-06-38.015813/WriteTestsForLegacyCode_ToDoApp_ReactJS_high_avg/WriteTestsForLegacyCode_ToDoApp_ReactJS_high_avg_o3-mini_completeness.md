# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering  
  The file "app.test.tsx" contains a "rendering" describe block that verifies the header, main section, and footer are conditionally rendered, confirming component rendering is tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos  
  The "adding todos" section in "app.test.tsx" verifies that pressing the Enter key on the input (with valid input and whitespace conditions) correctly calls "addTodo" on the model.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos  
  The "toggle all functionality" block in "app.test.tsx" checks that changing the toggle-all checkbox calls the "toggleAll" method and properly reflects the checkbox state.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos  
  There is a "todo filtering" section which tests that all todos display when filter is set to ALL_TODOS and attempts to test the active filter. However, one of the tests includes a comment on the difficulty of fully simulating the state change for the active filter. This makes us slightly less than 100% confident in the thoroughness of the filtering tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The tests cover the "clearCompleted" functionality by verifying that the model's "clearCompleted" method is called when the corresponding action is triggered.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering  
  "todoItem.test.tsx" includes a "rendering" describe block that confirms the correct display of the todo item title, checkbox state, destroy button, and edit input.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos  
  Separate tests verify that clicking the checkbox toggles the todo, clicking the destroy button removes the item, and double-clicking the label triggers editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events  
  The "keyboard events" section in "todoItem.test.tsx" tests for Enter and Escape keys, as well as ensuring that other keys produce no action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts  
  "footer.test.tsx" verifies that the footer renders the correct active todo count (singular and plural forms) depending on the count provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation  
  The test file checks that each filter link ("All", "Active", "Completed") is rendered and that the correct link has the "selected" CSS class based on the current filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The tests confirm the presence of the "Clear completed" button when completed todos exist and also test that the appropriate callback is called when the button is clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos  
  "todoModel.test.ts" comprises tests for addTodo, toggle, save, and destroy functionalities, ensuring CRUD operations work as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions  
  The tests verify that subscribers are added via subscribe and that the inform method saves data to localStorage and triggers subscribers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  There is a dedicated block in "todoModel.test.ts" confirming that clearCompleted properly removes completed todos and preserves incomplete ones.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation  
  The "uuid" describe block in "utils.test.ts" verifies that the generated UUID conforms to a valid format and that it is unique with a version 4 marker.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality  
  The tests confirm that the pluralization works correctly for counts of 1, 0, and values greater than 1.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations  
  The "store" describe block tests storing data to localStorage, retrieving data, and handling invalid or null data.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function  
  Tests under the "extend" block confirm that objects are merged correctly, properties are overridden as expected, and that the original objects remain unmodified.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx  
  The test files are named following the convention (e.g., app.test.tsx, todoItem.test.tsx, footer.test.tsx, todoModel.test.ts, utils.test.ts), meeting the naming requirements.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data  
  Multiple test files create sample todo objects (of type ITodo) for testing, ensuring that sample data is consistently available for tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented  
  In "app.test.tsx", the router is mocked and its initialization is verified with the correct routing configuration, confirming that routing tests are implemented.
