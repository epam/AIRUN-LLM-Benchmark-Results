# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies Angular.js as the framework used
  
  The documentation consistently and correctly identifies AngularJS as the framework throughout the document, beginning from the title "AngularJS Page Editor Module Documentation" and consistently referencing Angular-specific concepts like `$resource`, controllers, factories, and other Angular-specific syntax and patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all factories (REST, Page, Users) are accurately documented with their purposes
  
  All three factories are thoroughly documented with their correct purposes:
  - REST Factory: Described as providing "$resource objects configured for each API endpoint" for backend communication
  - Page Factory: Correctly described as a "singleton state holder for the current page being edited"
  - Users Factory: Accurately described as a "singleton for current authenticated user information"

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of the Page controller and its functionality is technically accurate
  
  The documentation provides a technically accurate description of the Page controller, listing its major responsibilities including initialization, localStorage autosave, page deletion, watching/broadcasting, field change handling, and the save flow. The implementation details match AngularJS controller patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the RESTful API endpoints are correctly documented
  
  The documentation provides detailed information about the REST endpoints used by the module, including the URL patterns and available methods (save, get, query, delete, update) for content, contentRevisions, contentExtras, contentTags, and other resources.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of Angular module dependencies ($resource, $location, etc.) is correct
  
  The documentation correctly explains Angular module dependencies such as $resource, $location, $scope, $rootScope, $routeParams, $upload, and $translate, showing the proper dependency injection syntax and explaining how these services are used in the controller.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the page management features (creating, editing, deleting) are accurately described
  
  The documentation accurately describes all page management features:
  - Creating: Details the initialization of new pages via the "/new" route
  - Editing: Explains how existing pages are loaded and populated into the form
  - Deleting: Documents the delete confirmation flow and the cascade delete process

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately explains how the local storage mechanism works
  
  The documentation correctly explains the localStorage auto-save mechanism, including how it detects and offers recovery of unsaved local edits, how it handles per-field keying by URL, and how it manages deletion of localStorage entries for discarded edits.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of form validation logic is technically accurate
  
  The form validation logic is accurately described in the documentation, including URL uniqueness checking, required fields validation (type selection, non-empty URL), and the handling of validation within the save flow.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of publish/schedule date handling is correct
  
  The documentation correctly explains the publish/schedule date handling, including:
  - The three publish states ('Y', 'N', 'schedule') in the radio buttons
  - Setting default schedule date for new pages
  - Determining publish date vs. schedule date during save

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the tag management and autocomplete feature explanation is technically accurate
  
  The tag management and autocomplete features are accurately described, including:
  - How tags are stored and displayed
  - The autocomplete mechanism using REST.contentTags for suggestions
  - The selection logic for tag suggestions
  - The UI elements for tag input and suggestion display

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the relationship between controllers, factories, and templates is accurately explained
  
  The documentation clearly explains how controllers, factories, and templates interact:
  - How Page and Users factories provide state storage across the app
  - How the controller syncs $scope.page with the Page factory
  - How the template binds to $scope values with ng-model and other directives
  - How REST factory is used by the controller to make backend calls

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation correctly identifies and explains the purpose of broadcast events
  
  The documentation correctly identifies and explains broadcast events such as:
  - 'contentGet' for loading the Page factory from a parent loader
  - 'notify' for user notifications via $rootScope.$broadcast
  - Broadcasting settings reload when page type changes
