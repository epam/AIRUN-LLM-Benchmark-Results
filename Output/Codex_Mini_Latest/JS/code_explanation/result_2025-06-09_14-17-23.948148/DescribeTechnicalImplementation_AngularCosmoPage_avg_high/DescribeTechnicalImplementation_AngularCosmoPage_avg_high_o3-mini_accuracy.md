# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies Angular.js as the framework used  
  The documentation clearly demonstrates usage of AngularJS through module definitions (e.g., angular.module(…)) and Angular-specific components like controllers and factories.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all factories (REST, Page, Users) are accurately documented with their purposes  
  Each of the three factories is documented with an explanation of its responsibilities, including their use in handling REST endpoints, state management, and user data, respectively.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of the Page controller and its functionality is technically accurate  
  The documentation details the Page controller’s role in initialization, autosave management, REST interactions, and UI behavior. It accurately explains the controller’s responsibilities and outlines both high-level logic and detailed steps.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the RESTful API endpoints are correctly documented  
  The REST endpoints are listed and explained correctly. Each resource and method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) is appropriately covered along with examples of URL patterns used by the REST factory.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of Angular module dependencies ($resource, $location, etc.) is correct  
  The documentation captures key Angular dependencies such as $resource, $location, $translate, and others. It explains their roles in routing, data binding, and REST communication accurately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the page management features (creating, editing, deleting) are accurately described  
  The documentation thoroughly describes the CRUD operations supported by the module, including creating new pages, editing existing pages, and deleting pages. It mentions the workflow for save actions and deletion confirmation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately explains how the local storage mechanism works  
  The local autosave feature is explained with details on localStorage keying and edit recovery. The explanation covers detection of unsaved edits and the mechanism to discard or use a locally stored version.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of form validation logic is technically accurate  
  The documentation outlines that form validation occurs during the save process by checking URL uniqueness, ensuring required fields are populated, and validating publish state. It accurately reflects common AngularJS practices in form validation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of publish/schedule date handling is correct  
  The description clearly explains how publish, draft, and schedule states are managed, including the role of the publish date and the scheduleDate field when pages are set to "schedule".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the tag management and autocomplete feature explanation is technically accurate  
  Tag management is well-documented, with a description of how tags are input, how autocomplete suggestions are generated via REST queries, and how users can select existing tags.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the relationship between controllers, factories, and templates is accurately explained  
  The interactions between Page/Users factories, pageCtrl, and the HTML template are described clearly, detailing how shared state and UI components interact in an AngularJS application.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation correctly identifies and explains the purpose of broadcast events  
  The usage of $rootScope.$broadcast for notifications is mentioned, with an explanation of how broadcast events integrate with UI notifications and accessibility (aria-live), ensuring that developers understand its purpose.
