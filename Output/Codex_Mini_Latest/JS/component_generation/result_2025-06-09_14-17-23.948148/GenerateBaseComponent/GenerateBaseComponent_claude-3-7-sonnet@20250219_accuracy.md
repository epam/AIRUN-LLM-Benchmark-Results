# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x
  
  The component imports from React and uses React hooks like useState, useRef, and useEffect, which are compatible with React 18. The code specifically mentions "using React 18" in the introductory description.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
  
  The code uses TypeScript with proper type definitions, including interfaces for props (SearchableSelectProps) and data structure (Option). The file extension is .tsx, and all functions properly type their parameters and return values.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling
  
  The submission includes a complete index.css file that styles all aspects of the component, and the component imports this CSS file correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments
  
  The code is clean, well-structured, and contains no TODO comments or placeholder implementations. All features are fully implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility
  
  The component properly uses useState hooks to manage state for isOpen (dropdown visibility), searchTerm (input value), and highlightedIndex (currently highlighted option). It also correctly handles controlled state through props.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props
  
  The component accepts a variety of props through the SearchableSelectProps interface, including options, value, onChange, placeholder, disabled, and className, making it highly customizable and reusable.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection
  
  The component implements comprehensive keyboard event handlers in the handleInputKeyDown function, supporting ArrowDown, ArrowUp, Enter, and Escape keys for navigation and selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions
  
  The component properly uses useRef hooks for DOM references (containerRef, inputRef, listRef) and follows React best practices for manipulating the DOM, such as scrolling elements into view.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques
  
  The component implements proper focus management by focusing the input when the dropdown opens, returning focus to the input when it closes, and maintaining focus during keyboard navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
  
  The component uses appropriate ARIA attributes including role="combobox", aria-haspopup, aria-owns, aria-expanded, aria-autocomplete, aria-controls, aria-disabled, role="listbox", role="option", and aria-selected for accessibility.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  The code appears to be free of potential console errors and warnings, with proper null checks and conditionals. However, there's a minor TypeScript issue in the click outside handler where MouseEvent is imported from React but used as a generic MouseEvent, which could potentially cause type conflicts.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component
  
  The component uses React's useEffect with appropriate dependency arrays to prevent unnecessary re-renders. It correctly separates effects based on their responsibilities. However, it could potentially benefit from memoization of filteredOptions using useMemo to further optimize render performance when options or searchTerm change frequently.
