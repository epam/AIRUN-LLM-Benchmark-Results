# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component conditionally renders a `<ul>` element with the role "listbox" when the dropdown is open, which serves as the dropdown UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  A text `<input>` element is included in the component and is used for filtering (searching) the dropdown options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The component manages a single selected option via props and calls the provided `onChange` when an option is selected, confirming single-select behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The `handleInputKeyDown` function handles 'ArrowDown' and 'ArrowUp' keys to navigate through the filtered list of options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  When the Enter key is pressed while an option is highlighted, the component selects that option via the `handleSelect` function.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  Pressing Enter when the dropdown is closed triggers it to open, and pressing Enter while open selects an option, effectively toggling the dropdown's visibility as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  A useEffect hook ensures that once the dropdown closes, the input regains focus, thereby maintaining proper focus management.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  An onClick handler on each `<li>` triggers the selection and then closes the dropdown by calling `closeDropdown()`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  The Enter key event, when an option is highlighted, selects the item and subsequently calls `closeDropdown()`, ensuring the dropdown is closed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  The Escape key is handled in the keydown event to immediately close the dropdown if it is open.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  An event listener is attached to document mouse events to detect clicks outside the component and close the dropdown accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  When the input is focused and the Enter key is pressed while the dropdown is closed, the component correctly opens the dropdown.
