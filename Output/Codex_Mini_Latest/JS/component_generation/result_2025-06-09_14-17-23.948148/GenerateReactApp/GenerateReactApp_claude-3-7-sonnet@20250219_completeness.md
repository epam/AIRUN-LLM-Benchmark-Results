# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The application fetches characters from the Star Wars API at `https://swapi.dev/api/people` and renders them using the `CharacterList` component. The data fetching occurs in the `App.tsx` file using Axios, and the fetched data is passed to the `CharacterList` component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls

  The application includes a loading state that is initially set to `true`. While loading, the UI displays a "Loading characters..." message, which serves as a loading indicator. The loading state is set to `false` after the API call completes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI

  The `CharacterList` component maps through all characters received from the API and renders each one as a list item, ensuring all fetched characters are displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields

  The application is minimal and focused solely on displaying the list of Star Wars characters. There are no search inputs, filters, or any other user input fields included in the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name

  In the `CharacterList` component, each character is rendered as a list item (`<li>`) showing the character's name property: `<li key={char.url}>{char.name}</li>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App

  The project structure and configuration files align with Create React App standards. The presence of `react-scripts` in the dependencies, the specific `tsconfig.json` extending from React Scripts, and the overall file structure confirm this is a Create React App project.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states

  The application uses React's `useState` hook to manage three distinct states:
  - `characters`: Stores the fetched character data
  - `loading`: Tracks whether the API request is in progress
  - `error`: Captures any error messages if the API call fails
  
  These states are properly updated throughout the API call lifecycle.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering

  Each character list item is assigned a unique key using the character's URL: `<li key={char.url}>`. This ensures React can efficiently update the DOM when the list changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately

  If the API call fails, the application shows an error message. The loading state prevents rendering an empty list before data is available. The code structure ensures that the list is only rendered when data is successfully fetched.
