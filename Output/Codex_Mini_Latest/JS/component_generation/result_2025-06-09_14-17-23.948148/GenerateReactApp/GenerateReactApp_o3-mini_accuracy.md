# Evaluation Report

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that the application uses React 18.x or newer by checking the package.json dependencies.  
  The package.json lists "react": "^18.2.0" and "react-dom": "^18.2.0", which confirms usage of React 18.x.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that TypeScript is properly implemented with appropriate type definitions for all components, props, and states.  
  The code uses TypeScript with explicit interfaces (e.g., Person, CharacterListProps) and React.FC type annotations in the components, ensuring proper type safety.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that Axios is used for API requests to fetch data from the Star Wars API endpoint.  
  In the App.tsx file, Axios is imported and used via axios.get to fetch data from "https://swapi.dev/api/people".

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure that the application handles API errors gracefully with appropriate error states or messages.  
  The try/catch block in the useEffect hook sets an error message upon failure and the UI displays the error when encountered.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that the character data is fetched on component mount using the useEffect hook.  
  The useEffect hook with an empty dependency array ensures the API request is executed once on component mount.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that the application properly manages component rendering optimization.  
  The CharacterList component is wrapped with React.memo, which effectively prevents unnecessary re-renders when props have not changed.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure the code follows React best practices using hooks appropriately.  
  The code cleanly separates state management, side effects (using useEffect), and renders components without introducing anti-patterns.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that the application doesn't contain any TODO comments or unnecessary code.  
  A review of the code shows that there are no extraneous TODO comments or superfluous code elements.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure the codebase has minimal comments that only clarify complex logic when necessary.  
  The provided code contains clear, concise comments and documentation only where required, keeping the codebase readable.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that the API endpoint 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' is being called correctly.  
  The Axios call in App.tsx correctly references 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' and expects the data structure to include a "results" array.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that the application renders without console errors or warnings.  
  Based on the implementation details and adherence to best practices, the application should render cleanly. No obvious issues indicate any rendering or console warnings/errors.
