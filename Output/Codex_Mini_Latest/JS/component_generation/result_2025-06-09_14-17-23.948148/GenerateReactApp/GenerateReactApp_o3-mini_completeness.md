# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The application fetches data from https://swapi.dev/api/people and passes the resulting characters to the CharacterList component, which then renders them in a list.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The App component conditionally renders a div with the text "Loading characters..." when the loading state is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  Once data is fetched, the characters array is passed to the CharacterList component, which maps over them to display each character. This confirms that all fetched characters will be rendered.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  There is no implementation of search controls or user input fields within the provided code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  In the CharacterList component, each list item is rendered using {char.name}, ensuring the character's name is displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The project structure, along with the use of react-scripts and the existence of package.json and tsconfig.json configured for Create React App, confirms this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The App component uses React’s useState hook for managing loading, error, and character data states, and transitions between these states appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  The CharacterList component uses the character’s URL as the key (<li key={char.url}>), which is assumed to be unique for each character.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  The code renders an empty unordered list when the characters array is empty. While it does not display a custom "no data" message, it does not crash or misbehave, which is acceptable for minimal handling.  
  Explanation: A more explicit empty state message could be added to enhance user experience, but the current implementation handles the empty data condition without error.
