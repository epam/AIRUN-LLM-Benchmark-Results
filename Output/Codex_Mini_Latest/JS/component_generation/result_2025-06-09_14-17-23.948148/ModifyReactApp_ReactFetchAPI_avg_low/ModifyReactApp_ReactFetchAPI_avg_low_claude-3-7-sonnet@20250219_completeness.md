# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name
  
  The implementation includes an input field with onChange handler that updates the searchTerm state and triggers a search to filter characters by name.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests
  
  The code includes a loading state that displays "Loading..." text when API requests are in progress:
  ```tsx
  {loading && <div style={loadingStyle}>Loading...</div>}
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query
  
  The useEffect hook that handles API calls is triggered on component mount with an empty debouncedSearch value, which will fetch all characters initially.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type
  
  The implementation includes debouncing logic that updates search results 500ms after the user stops typing, avoiding excessive API calls while maintaining dynamic updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found
  
  The code includes a conditional rendering for when there are no search results:
  ```tsx
  {!loading && !error && characters.length === 0 && (
    <div style={noResultsStyle}>No characters found.</div>
  )}
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design
  
  The implementation uses responsive styling with relative units, fluid widths, and max-width constraints to ensure the component works well across different screen sizes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response
  
  The component maps through the characters state (which is populated from the API response) to render each character in a list item.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed
  
  The implementation includes a complete ErrorBoundary component that catches runtime rendering errors and displays a user-friendly error message.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props
  
  The code defines appropriate TypeScript interfaces for the API data (Character, PeopleResponse) and uses proper typing for all states, event handlers, and function parameters.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities
  
  The implementation enhances the original character list functionality by adding search capabilities without removing any existing features. All requirements have been met while maintaining the core functionality.
