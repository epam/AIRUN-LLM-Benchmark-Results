# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type  
  The input element uses an onChange event handler (handleChange) that updates the searchTerm state using setSearchTerm.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls  
  A useEffect hook implements a debounce using setTimeout with a 500ms delay, which is within the required 300-500ms range.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured  
  The code uses axios.get with the correct generic type (PeopleResponse) and passes search parameters via the params option.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses  
  All components, props, and API responses have been correctly typed using TypeScript interfaces and appropriate type annotations (e.g., for state hooks and event handlers).

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters  
  The API endpoint 'https://swapi.dev/api/people/' is used with the search parameter properly included in the axios request.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate  
  The useCallback hook is applied to memoize the handleChange function to prevent unnecessary re-creations on each render.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback  
  Errors are caught within the try-catch block, logged to the console, and an error message is set in the state, which is then displayed to the user.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing  
  The debouncing effect ensures that API calls are made based on the debouncedSearch state, which updates only after the user has stopped typing for 500ms.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices  
  The component leverages Reactâ€™s useState and useEffect hooks and maintains state updates in a clear and readable format.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code  
  The code provided is clean, with no apparent console errors, unused imports, or commented-out code fragments that would interfere with production-quality code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests  
  The loading state is set correctly before the API call and reset after the API call (both in success and error cases), ensuring that the UI reflects the loading state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns  
  The use of createRoot from 'react-dom/client' for rendering along with modern React hooks and TypeScript indicates a proper adherence to React 18 best practices.
