# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The code includes an `<input>` element with a placeholder "Search characters..." and an `onChange` handler that updates the search term, ensuring users can filter characters by name.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  The component maintains a `loading` state, and when set to true, it displays a "Loading..." message to indicate that an API request is in progress.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  On initial mount, the debounced search value is an empty string, which triggers a fetch for characters, thereby loading initial data seamlessly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  As users type into the search input, the state updates and, through a debouncing mechanism, triggers the API call. This ensures that the displayed search results update promptly with user input.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  The code checks if no characters are returned and, when there is no error or loading, renders a "No characters found." message to provide clear feedback.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The component uses inline CSS styles (e.g., `maxWidth: '600px'`, `width: '100%'`, appropriate padding) to ensure that the UI adapts responsively to various screen sizes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  The component maps over the `characters` array and renders each character's name, ensuring that search results received from the API are properly displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  An `ErrorBoundary` component is defined and used in `index.tsx` to catch any render-time errors, thus providing robust error handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The code defines TypeScript interfaces for API responses (`Character` and `PeopleResponse`) and uses proper type definitions for component props and state, ensuring strong type safety throughout.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  By integrating search input, debouncing, loading indicators, error handling, and responsive styling without removing existing functionality, the revised code enhances the original application while preserving its core behavior.
