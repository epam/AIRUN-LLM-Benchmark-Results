  The documentation explicitly lists these rules and shows code snippets detailing the validation for each field.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation correctly explains the asynchronous validation for checking existing usernames and emails

  The documentation captures the use of Promise.all to run the asynchronous validation checks in parallel, which is accurate.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation accurately describes the user flow from form completion to successful signup  
  The step-by-step user flow covering page loading, form input, submission, and feedback is explained clearly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately explains the error handling during form submission  
  It correctly covers how submission errors are handled by rejecting the promise with error details from the backend.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation correctly identifies the document title management using react-document-title  
  The documentation shows the use of <DocumentTitle> to set the browser title, which verifies this point.
