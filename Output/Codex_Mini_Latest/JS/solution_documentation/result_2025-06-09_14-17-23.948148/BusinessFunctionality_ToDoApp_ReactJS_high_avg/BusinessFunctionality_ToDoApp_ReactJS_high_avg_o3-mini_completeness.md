# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers all main functionality including adding, editing, deleting, and toggling todos  
  The document provides detailed sections listing features such as “Create a new todo item”, “Edit a todo’s text”, “Delete a todo”, and “Toggle completion”. Every core functionality is clearly described with file and code references.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about filtering todos by status (all, active, completed)  
  The analysis explicitly covers filtering functionality in both the business requirements and user interaction sections, including a table with the filter options and relevant code references.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the user workflow for creating new todo items  
  The document contains an entire section (2.3 “UI/UX Patterns” and 2.2 “Expected User Workflow”) that explains how a user creates a new todo item by typing and pressing Enter, with code references and sequential steps outlined.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the editing functionality triggered by double-clicking  
  The document clearly mentions that double‑clicking on a todo label initiates inline editing. It details the edit functionality in both the business requirements section and the overview for the TodoItem component with related code citations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the clear completed functionality  
  The clear completed functionality is documented under both the business requirements and the user interaction sections, with a table row in section 1.1 and code references in TodoFooter.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the toggle all functionality  
  The “Toggle all on/off” feature is described in the business requirements section and referenced in the code citations (e.g., in App.tsx with the toggleAll handler), demonstrating that the functionality is well covered.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the counter for remaining items  
  The counter is described when explaining the TodoFooter component, including details on the count summary and pluralization (item/items) logic along with code reference to Utils.pluralize.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the persistent storage of todos  
  Persistent storage is addressed in the technical overview of the TodoModel and Utils.store with explicit mentions of localStorage, ensuring that todo persistence is clearly documented.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the UI components and their relationships  
  The document lists core components such as TodoApp, TodoModel, TodoItem, and TodoFooter, explaining their responsibilities, interactions, and key props/state. This detailed mapping of relationships satisfies the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the business objectives addressed by the application  
  Business objectives such as task management, ease of use, collaboration, and visibility are mapped out in a dedicated section that relates each objective to its implementation in the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes performance and scalability considerations  
  Performance optimizations (like shouldComponentUpdate and immutable updates), scalability considerations, and potential constraints (like localStorage limits) are clearly described.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes technical constraints and limitations  
  The document outlines technical assumptions, constraints (e.g., use of localStorage, hash routing, browser-only persistence), and architectural presumptions, thereby fulfilling this evaluation step.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the pluralization of item/items text based on count  
  The explanation of the counter in the footer includes the use of the Utils.pluralize method to handle the “item/items” text dynamically, addressing this point fully.
