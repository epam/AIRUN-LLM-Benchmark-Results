# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props
  
  The code consistently uses TypeScript throughout all components with proper typing for variables, functions, props, and state. Examples include:
  - Interfaces for all data models in `src/types/index.ts`
  - Type annotations for props in UI components like `InputProps`, `TextAreaProps`, etc.
  - Return type annotations for API functions, hooks, and selectors
  - Properly typed Redux state, actions, and thunks

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management
  
  Redux Toolkit is properly implemented with:
  - `configureStore` in `src/app/store.ts`
  - `createSlice` for defining reducers and actions in `pageSlice.ts` and `usersSlice.ts`
  - `createAsyncThunk` for handling async operations
  - Custom typed hooks for using Redux in `src/app/hooks.ts`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components
  
  All components are implemented as functional components using the `React.FC<Props>` pattern, including:
  - `PageEditor.tsx`
  - UI components like `Button`, `Input`, `Select`, etc.
  - No class components or lifecycle methods are used

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately
  
  React hooks are used correctly throughout the codebase:
  - `useState` for component-local state (e.g., `confirmDelete`, `newerVersion`)
  - `useEffect` for side effects (data fetching, local storage syncing)
  - `useCallback` for memoized event handlers with proper dependency arrays
  - `useMemo` for derived values (e.g., `titleLength`, `descriptionLength`)

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource
  
  API communication uses axios instead of Angular's $resource:
  - Axios instance is created in `src/api/restService.ts`
  - API methods return Promises with proper typing
  - Error handling is implemented in thunks

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components
  
  All form elements are implemented as controlled components:
  - Input values are bound to Redux state
  - `onChange` handlers dispatch actions to update state
  - No direct DOM manipulation or uncontrolled components are used

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation
  
  React Router v6 is properly implemented:
  - Routes defined in `src/App.tsx`
  - `useParams` and `useNavigate` hooks used in `PageEditor.tsx`
  - Navigation actions triggered programmatically

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization
  
  react-i18next is implemented correctly:
  - Configuration in `src/i18n/index.ts`
  - Translation resources in `src/i18n/resources.ts`
  - `useTranslation` hook used in components
  - Translated text used throughout the UI

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization
  
  Code splitting is implemented using:
  - `React.lazy` for component lazy loading in `src/App.tsx`
  - `Suspense` fallback for loading states
  - Dynamic imports for code splitting

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations
  
  `React.memo` is used appropriately for all UI components:
  - UI components like `Button`, `Input`, `TextArea`, etc.
  - The main `PageEditor` component is also memoized

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks
  
  Dependency arrays are properly implemented in all hooks:
  - `useEffect` hooks include all dependencies they reference
  - `useCallback` memoizes functions with proper dependency arrays
  - No eslint-disable comments or empty dependency arrays where they shouldn't be

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models
  
  TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models:
  - Core data models in `src/types/index.ts`
  - Component-specific interfaces like `PageState`, `UsersState`
  - Props interfaces for all components

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state
  
  Redux selectors are properly implemented:
  - Dedicated selector files (`pageSelectors.ts`, `usersSelectors.ts`)
  - Type-safe selectors using the RootState type
  - Consistent use of selectors in components

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations
  
  Action creators are properly implemented using Redux Toolkit:
  - Actions defined in slices (e.g., `setTitle`, `setDescription`, etc.)
  - Async thunks for API operations (e.g., `fetchPageById`, `createPage`, etc.)
  - Actions exported and used consistently in components

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks
  
  Local storage functionality is implemented using:
  - Custom `useLocalStorage` hook in `src/hooks/useLocalStorage.ts`
  - Proper localStorage handling in `PageEditor.tsx` for detecting unsaved changes
  - Effects for syncing state with localStorage
