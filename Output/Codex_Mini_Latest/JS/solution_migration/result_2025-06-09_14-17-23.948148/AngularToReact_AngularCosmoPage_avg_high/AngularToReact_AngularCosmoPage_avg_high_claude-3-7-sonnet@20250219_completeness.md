# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented

    The code comprehensively implements all page management functionality:
    - Create: Implemented in the `createPage` thunk and handled in the `handleSave` function with `isNew` or `duplicate` flag
    - Update: Implemented in the `updatePage` thunk and handled in the `handleSave` function
    - Delete: Implemented in the `deletePage` thunk and handled in the `handleDelete` function
    - Duplicate: Implemented by calling `handleSave(true)` in the UI buttons section

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present

    Page type selection is fully implemented:
    - The `PageEditor.tsx` component includes a `Select` component for page types
    - The `handleTypeChange` function updates the state when a type is selected
    - Type validation is performed before saving with an error message if no type is selected
    - Type data is properly fetched from theme pages

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists

    URL auto-generation from title is implemented in the `handleTitleChange` function:
    ```tsx
    // auto-URL
    if (!url || url === '/new') {
      const newUrl = val
        .toLowerCase()
        .replace(/ /g, '-')
        .replace(/[\.,\/#!$%\^&\*;:{}=_'~()\?]/g, '');
      dispatch(setUrl(newUrl));
    }
    ```
    This correctly generates a URL slug from the title by converting to lowercase, replacing spaces with hyphens, and removing special characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented

    Tag management with autocomplete is fully implemented:
    - The `handleTagsChange` function processes tags and triggers suggestion fetching
    - The `fetchTagSuggestions` thunk retrieves suggestion data from the API
    - The `TagSuggestions` component displays suggestions
    - The `handleSelectSuggestion` function handles selecting a suggestion
    - The `clearSuggestions` action clears suggestions when needed

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available

    All publish status options are implemented:
    - Radio buttons for "Publish" (Y), "Draft" (N), and "Schedule" (schedule)
    - The `handlePublishChange` function updates the state when an option is selected
    - The publish status is correctly included in the save payload

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented

    Scheduled publishing functionality is correctly implemented:
    - A datetime-local input appears conditionally when "Schedule" is selected
    - The `handleScheduleDateChange` function updates the state
    - The `formatDateTimeLocal` utility function formats dates for the input
    - The `pubDate` calculation in `handleSave` converts the schedule date to a Unix timestamp when "schedule" is selected

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present

    Local storage version comparison and restoration are well-implemented:
    - Auto-save to localStorage on each change using `useEffect`
    - Detection of unsaved localStorage changes using comparison
    - UI notification when newer versions are available
    - Options to discard, compare, or use the newer version
    - The `handleLocalVersion` and `handleDeleteNewer` functions manage these operations

- **Pass** (90%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented

    The notification system is implemented, but uses simple `alert()` calls rather than a more sophisticated component-based notification system:
    ```tsx
    alert(t('page_created'));
    alert(`${t('page_error_saving')}: ${err}`);
    ```
    While functional, this is a basic approach. A more modern approach would use toast notifications or a dedicated notification component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present

    Form validation for required fields is implemented:
    ```tsx
    if (!type) {
      alert(t('page_no_type_selected'));
      return;
    }
    if (!url || url === 'new') {
      alert(t('page_no_url'));
      return;
    }
    ```
    This validation is performed in the `handleSave` function before proceeding with API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled

    All API endpoints are properly handled in the `restService.ts` file, including:
    - Content endpoints for CRUD operations
    - Content tags endpoints
    - Content extras endpoints
    - Content revisions endpoints
    - Content revisions extras endpoints
    - Users endpoints
    - Placeholders for other domain endpoints (blocks, comments, files, etc.)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented

    Extras management is implemented:
    - The Redux state includes an `extras` field
    - Extras are included in the save payload
    - The `contentExtrasApi` and `contentRevisionsExtrasApi` handle the backend operations
    - When saving, extras are correctly processed and sent to the API

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained

    Revision history functionality is maintained:
    - The `contentRevisionsApi` provides methods for working with revisions
    - When creating or updating a page, a new revision is created
    - Revision extras are also handled appropriately
    - The data model includes `ContentRevision` type

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components

    The code is well-organized into feature folders with clean separation:
    - Feature folders (`features/page`, `features/users`)
    - Separation of UI components (`components/`)
    - API services (`api/`)
    - Redux state management (`slices`, `selectors`)
    - Utility functions (`utils/`)
    - Hooks (`hooks/`)
    - Types (`types/`)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved

    Translation functionality is preserved using react-i18next:
    - The `i18n` module is set up with resources
    - The `useTranslation` hook is used in components
    - All UI text uses translation keys with the `t()` function
    - Translation keys from the original Angular app are maintained

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters

    The application maintains the same URL structure:
    - React Router routes for `/new` and `/:slug`
    - The `useParams` hook extracts URL parameters
    - Navigation via `useNavigate` preserves URL structure
    - URL handling in API calls matches the original structure
