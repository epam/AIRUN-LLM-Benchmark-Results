# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props  
  All components, utility functions, and Redux slice files include TypeScript interfaces and type annotations (e.g., React.FC, interface definitions for props, state, and payloads). This indicates a strong adherence to strict typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management  
  The implementation makes extensive use of Redux Toolkitâ€™s createSlice, createAsyncThunk, and proper store configuration via configureStore, which confirms its usage for global state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components  
  All presented components (e.g., PageEditor, Button, Input, TextArea, Select, ConfirmDialog, and TagSuggestions) are implemented as functional components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately  
  The PageEditor and other components make proper use of several React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, and useMemo) to manage state, side-effects, and performance optimizations.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource  
  The API service is implemented in an axios-based service (`restService.ts`), replacing any Angular $resource usage with modern API communication.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components  
  The form inputs in the PageEditor component (e.g., Input, TextArea, Select) are controlled components with proper onChange handlers and state management via Redux.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation  
  Routing is implemented using React Router v6 (Routes, Route, Navigate, useParams, and useNavigate) to manage navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization  
  Internationalization is handled using react-i18next, with clear example usage in components (e.g., translations in ConfirmDialog) and proper resource configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization  
  Code splitting is demonstrated via React.lazy and Suspense in App.tsx, efficiently loading components on demand.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations  
  React.memo is used in multiple components (e.g., Input, TextArea, TagSuggestions, Button) to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks  
  The useEffect and useCallback hooks include appropriate dependency arrays, ensuring that side-effects run only when intended.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models  
  All data models, including those for REST payload types and Redux state slices, have clearly defined TypeScript interfaces.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state  
  Redux selectors (e.g., pageSelectors, usersSelectors) are properly defined and used to access state across the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations  
  State mutations are handled using actions defined in createSlice, with clearly defined action creators and corresponding reducers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks  
  Local storage usage is implemented via a custom hook (useLocalStorage) and additional manual localStorage logic in the PageEditor, ensuring unsaved changes are handled effectively.
