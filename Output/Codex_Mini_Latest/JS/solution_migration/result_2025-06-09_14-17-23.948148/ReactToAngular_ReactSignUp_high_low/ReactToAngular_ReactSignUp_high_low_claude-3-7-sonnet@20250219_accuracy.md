# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling
    
    The `SignupComponent` clearly uses Angular's Reactive Forms approach. It injects `FormBuilder`, creates a `FormGroup` in the `ngOnInit` method, and uses form controls with formControlName directives in the template.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)
    
    The form validation includes all required validations:
    - Name length validation via `nameRangeValidator` which checks for 3-60 characters
    - Email format validation via Angular's built-in `Validators.email`
    - Password length validation via `passwordLengthValidator` which checks for minimum 6 characters

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use
    
    The form setup includes async validators for both name and email uniqueness:
    - `asyncValidators: [this.sv.uniqueName()]` for the name field
    - `asyncValidators: [this.sv.uniqueEmail()]` for the email field
    
    These validators call the API to check if the name or email is already taken.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched
    
    The `FormGroupComponent` applies CSS classes based on control state:
    ```typescript
    [ngClass]="{ 'has-error': control.touched && control.invalid, 'has-success': control.touched && control.valid }"
    ```
    This ensures fields show appropriate styling for success/error states when touched.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions
    
    The submission flow is correctly implemented:
    1. The `onSubmit()` method in `SignupComponent` dispatches the signup action with form data
    2. The auth effects intercept this action and call the API service
    3. Based on API response, success or failure actions are dispatched

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails
    
    The `FormGroupComponent` displays error messages below form fields:
    ```html
    <div *ngIf="control.touched && control.errors" class="help-block">
      {{ firstError }}
    </div>
    ```
    The component also provides appropriate error messages for different validation errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service
    
    The `SignupComponent` sets the page title using Angular's Title service:
    ```typescript
    this.title.setTitle(getTitle('Signup'));
    ```
    This is done in the `ngOnInit` method.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management
    
    The code clearly uses NgRx for state management:
    - It imports and uses Store to dispatch actions and select state
    - It has properly defined actions, a reducer, and effects
    - The auth module imports the necessary NgRx modules

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress
    
    The submit button is disabled during submission:
    ```html
    <button
      type="submit"
      class="btn btn-primary form-control"
      [disabled]="submitting"
    >
    ```
    The `submitting` property is updated based on the loading state from the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses
    
    The `AuthEffects` class properly handles both success and error responses:
    ```typescript
    map(result => AuthActions.signupSuccess({ user: result.data })),
    catchError(err => of(AuthActions.signupFailure({ errors: err.error })))
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management
    
    The component follows best practices:
    - It implements `OnInit` and `OnDestroy` lifecycle hooks
    - It properly manages subscriptions and unsubscribes in `ngOnDestroy`
    - It separates concerns with appropriate component structure
    - It follows Angular's best practices for form handling

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises
    
    The code properly uses Angular's HttpClient for API calls:
    ```typescript
    return this.http.post<ApiResponse<any>>('/api/signup', { name, email, password });
    ```
    The service returns Observables, not Promises, as expected with HttpClient.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements
    
    The `FormGroupComponent` has a `firstError` getter that returns appropriate error messages for all validation cases:
    - Required fields: "This field is required"
    - Email format: "A valid email address is required"
    - Name length: "Name must be between 3 and 60 characters in length"
    - Password length: "Password must be at least 6 characters"
    - Unique name: "This name is already in use"
    - Unique email: "This email is already in use"
    - Server errors: The error message from the server
