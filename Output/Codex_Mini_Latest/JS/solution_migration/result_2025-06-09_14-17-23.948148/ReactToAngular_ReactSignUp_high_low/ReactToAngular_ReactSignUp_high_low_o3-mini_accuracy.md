# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The SignupComponent imports FormBuilder to create the form group and uses ReactiveFormsModule in the module.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The form uses Validators.required along with custom synchronous validators (nameRangeValidator ensuring 3–60 characters and passwordLengthValidator ensuring a minimum of 6 characters) as well as Validators.email to check proper email format.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  The component applies asyncValidators using SignupValidators.uniqueName() and SignupValidators.uniqueEmail(), which call the API endpoints to verify name and email uniqueness.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The FormGroupComponent template conditionally applies CSS classes "has-error" and "has-success" based on the control’s touched and validity states, ensuring proper visual feedback.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  The onSubmit() method dispatches a signup action via @ngrx/store when the form is valid. This action is handled in AuthEffects which in turn calls the API service.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  Error messages are rendered in the FormGroupComponent using the "firstError" getter which maps the control's errors to human-friendly messages (e.g., required, email, nameRange, etc.).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  In ngOnInit(), the title is set with this.title.setTitle(getTitle('Signup')), ensuring the browser title is appropriately updated.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The component dispatches actions via the Store and subscribes to store selectors for loading and error state. Additionally, the AuthModule is configured with StoreModule.forFeature and EffectsModule.forFeature.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button’s disabled property is bound to the “submitting” flag, which is updated from the store’s loading state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  In AuthEffects, the API call on signup is managed with a switchMap. It dispatches signupSuccess on a successful API response and signupFailure (via catchError) in case of an error.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The SignupComponent implements OnInit and OnDestroy, correctly sets up and tears down subscriptions, reflecting good Angular lifecycle management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The AuthApiService utilizes Angular’s HttpClient to perform HTTP calls (post and get) ensuring proper use of Angular’s services instead of handling promises directly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The error messages in the FormGroupComponent for various validation error keys (e.g., required, email, nameRange, passwordLength, nameTaken, emailTaken) clearly map to the requirements.
