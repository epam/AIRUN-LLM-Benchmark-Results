# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The code clearly uses Angular framework syntax and patterns throughout, with specific Angular decorators like `@Component`, `@NgModule`, `@Injectable`, etc. The structure follows Angular conventions with modules, components, and services organized appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
  
  The implementation includes proper NgRx store integration with imports from `@ngrx/store` and store being injected into components. The app.module.ts file shows `StoreModule.forRoot(reducers)` being imported.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
  
  Effects are implemented using `@ngrx/effects` with a `TodoEffects` class that handles side effects like loading todos from localStorage and persisting state changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
  
  The implementation includes a complete set of actions (in todo.actions.ts), reducers (in todo.reducer.ts), and selectors (in todo.selectors.ts) for the todo functionality. The actions include operations like add, toggle, delete, update, etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
  
  All components use the `@Component` decorator with appropriate metadata. Child components like TodoItemComponent use `@Input()` and `@Output()` decorators for data flow.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators
  
  The TodoItemComponent uses `@ViewChild('editInput')` to access the edit input element, which is the Angular equivalent of React refs.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
  
  The components properly use `@Input()` for passing data down and `@Output() EventEmitter` for communicating events up the component hierarchy. For example, TodoItemComponent receives a todo via `@Input()` and emits events like toggle, delete, etc. via `@Output()`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
  
  The code includes services like TodoStorageService that handle business logic like loading from and saving to localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
  
  Dependency injection is used throughout the application. Services are provided with `@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })` and components inject services and store in their constructors.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
  
  All components use `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` for optimal performance, which is specified in their `@Component` decorators.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
  
  The code implements Angular Router with both app-level routing (AppRoutingModule) and feature-level routing (TodosRoutingModule). It's configured to use hash-style URLs with `useHash: true` to match the original React app's routing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code follows Angular style guide conventions with proper file naming, component structure, feature modules, and separation of concerns (presentational vs container components).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
  
  TypeScript interfaces like `Todo` and types like `Filter` are defined and used consistently throughout the application, with proper typing on all methods and properties.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
  
  All JSX templates have been converted to Angular HTML templates with appropriate Angular-specific syntax like `*ngFor`, `*ngIf`, and property/event binding using square and parenthesis notation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
  
  React event handlers like `onClick` have been replaced with Angular event bindings like `(click)`. The event handling logic has been appropriately adapted to Angular's approach.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs
  
  There are no TODO comments or incomplete implementations in the provided code. The code appears to be fully implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules
  
  Lazy loading is implemented for the TodosModule in the app-routing.module.ts file using the standard Angular pattern: `loadChildren: () => import('./todos/todos.module').then(m => m.TodosModule)`.
