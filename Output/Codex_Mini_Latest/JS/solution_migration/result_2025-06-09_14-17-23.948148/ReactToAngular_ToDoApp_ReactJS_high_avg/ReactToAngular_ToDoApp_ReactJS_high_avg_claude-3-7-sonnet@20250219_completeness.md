# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items
  
  The application includes a TodoListComponent that properly displays todo items through the `*ngFor="let todo of todos"` directive in the todo-list.component.html template. The todos are obtained from the NgRx store via selectors and passed to the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented
  
  Adding new todo items is implemented in the TodoAppComponent through the `addTodo()` method which dispatches the TodoActions.addTodo action. The input field is bound to the newTodoTitle property and uses the (keyup.enter) event to call addTodo().

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works
  
  The toggling functionality is implemented with the `toggleTodo(id)` method in TodoAppComponent which dispatches the TodoActions.toggleTodo action. The TodoItemComponent emits toggle events that are captured by the parent component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented
  
  Editing is implemented through the editTodo(), cancelEdit(), and saveTodo() methods in TodoAppComponent. The TodoItemComponent properly handles editing state and uses ViewChild to focus the input element during editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented
  
  Deletion is implemented with the `deleteTodo(id)` method in TodoAppComponent which dispatches the TodoActions.deleteTodo action. The TodoItemComponent provides a delete button that emits events to the parent component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented
  
  The 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented via the `toggleAll(checked)` method in TodoAppComponent which dispatches the TodoActions.toggleAll action when the toggle-all checkbox is changed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works
  
  Filtering is implemented using Angular Router with routes for each filter state. The filter$ observable in TodoAppComponent captures the current filter from the route params, and the todos$ observable combines filter$ with allTodos$ to filter the displayed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The TodoFooterComponent displays the count of active items through the `count` @Input property and uses a getter method `activeTodoWord` to properly pluralize "item" based on the count.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items
  
  The 'Clear completed' button is implemented in TodoFooterComponent and only appears when there are completed items (`*ngIf="completedCount > 0"`). It emits an event that is handled by the `clearCompleted()` method in TodoAppComponent, which dispatches the TodoActions.clearCompleted action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage
  
  Persistence to localStorage is implemented through the TodoStorageService and the persistTodos$ effect in TodoEffects, which listens for various action types and saves the updated todos to localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation
  
  The application uses hash-based routing with `useHash: true` in the AppRoutingModule to maintain the same URL structure (#/all, #/active, #/completed) as the original application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states
  
  Empty states are handled with proper conditionals in the templates, such as `*ngIf="(todos$ | async)?.length"` in todo-app.component.html to only show the main section when there are todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly
  
  Form submissions are handled correctly for both adding new todos and editing existing ones. The application prevents empty submissions and properly handles keyboard events (Enter to submit, Escape to cancel).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships
  
  The application follows Angular best practices with a container component (TodoAppComponent) that manages state and child presentational components that receive inputs and emit events. Components use OnPush change detection for better performance.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved
  
  All the business logic from the original application is preserved and properly migrated to Angular concepts. This includes todo creation, editing, deletion, toggling, filtering, and persistence. The application uses NgRx for state management instead of React's state management.
