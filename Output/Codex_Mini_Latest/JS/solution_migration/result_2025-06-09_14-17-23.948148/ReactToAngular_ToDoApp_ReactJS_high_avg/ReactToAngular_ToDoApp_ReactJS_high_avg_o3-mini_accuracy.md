# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The provided code and module structure are clearly created for Angular and reference Angular 14.x best practices. No legacy or mismatched Angular versions are evident.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The application imports and configures @ngrx/store with a proper reducer map, indicating clear use of the state management library.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  The code includes a dedicated effects class (TodoEffects) with several createEffect definitions to handle side effects such as localStorage persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  The repository contains well-defined actions, reducers (using NgRx Entity), and selectors that clearly manage state for todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  All components are annotated with @Component and use @Input() and @Output() for data and event communications.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  The TodoItemComponent replaces React refs with Angular’s @ViewChild (see the editInput reference), successfully mapping the behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  Component communication is correctly implemented via @Input for data binding and @Output EventEmitter for events across the container and presentational components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  Angular services such as TodoStorageService and Utils encapsulate business logic and data persistence tasks.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  Services and other dependencies are injected using Angular's DI system in components and effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  All components use ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush, which provides performance benefits and follows best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  Angular Router is properly configured using AppRoutingModule and TodosRoutingModule, including hash-style URLs and lazy loading.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code is modular, adheres to separation of concerns (smart/dumb component pattern), and uses Angular CLI-generated file structuring consistent with the style guide.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  Interfaces such as Todo and type definitions for Filter are consistently used, ensuring type safety.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  All JSX elements from the original React application have been successfully replaced with Angular HTML templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  Event handling is managed with Angular’s (click), (keydown), (blur), etc., replacing any React-specific patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  There are no TODO comments or placeholder code left in the implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  The TodosModule is lazy-loaded via the loadChildren syntax in the routing module, satisfying the lazy-loading requirement.
