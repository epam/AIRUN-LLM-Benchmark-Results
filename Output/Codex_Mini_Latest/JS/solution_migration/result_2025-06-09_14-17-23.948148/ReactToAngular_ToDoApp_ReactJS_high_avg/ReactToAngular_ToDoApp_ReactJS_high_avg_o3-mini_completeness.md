# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The application uses the TodoAppComponent and TodoListComponent to display the list of todo items. The combination of the NgRx selector (selectAllTodos) with filtering in the component ensures all items are rendered as appropriate.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoAppComponent includes an addTodo() method that dispatches an action to add a todo when the input field is used (triggered on keyup.enter). This confirms that new todo items are added to the list.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  Both the TodoItemComponent and TodoAppComponent include mechanisms to toggle the completed status of an item. The toggleTodo() method dispatches the related NgRx action, and the effect toggles the state accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  The code provides editTodo(), saveTodo(), and cancelEdit() methods in the container component, and the TodoItemComponent handles key events (ENTER and ESCAPE) during editing. This confirms that the editing functionality is fully supported.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  The application includes a delete button in the TodoItemComponent that triggers the deleteTodo() method which dispatches the deletion action. This confirms the deletion functionality works as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  The TodoAppComponent contains a toggleAll() method bound to the "Mark all as complete" checkbox. This method dispatches the appropriate action, ensuring the functionality is implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  The component retrieves the current filter from the Angular Router and uses it to filter the todos appropriately. The implementation in both the component and the NgRx selector confirms that filtering is correctly handled.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooterComponent receives the active count through an @Input property and displays it, thereby providing clear feedback on the number of active items.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The footer component provides a "Clear completed" button that dispatches the clearCompleted action. In the reducer, completed todos are properly filtered out, confirming the removal works.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  The TodoEffects class includes an effect (persistTodos$) that listens for state changes and uses the TodoStorageService to save todos to local storage, ensuring persistence across sessions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The Angular Router is configured with hash-style URLs (useHash: true) and appropriate routes for filters (e.g., #/active, #/completed), meeting the requirement for URL structure.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  The implementation uses an *ngIf condition on the main section of the TodoAppComponent to display content only when there are todos. While this approach aligns with TodoMVC behavior, explicit empty-state messaging isnâ€™t visible; however, the component behavior is consistent with the original design.  
  (Explanation: The UI hides the main list when there are no todo items, which is conventionally acceptable for TodoMVC, but could be enhanced with an explicit empty-state message.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  The addTodo() method processes input on keyup.enter and the editing forms use blur and keydown events to trigger submissions. This confirms that form submissions are managed correctly across the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The application distinguishes between container (TodoAppComponent) and presentation components (TodoListComponent, TodoItemComponent, TodoFooterComponent). Data flow via @Input and @Output fosters proper component relationships and communication.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  All core functionalities (filtering, adding, toggling, editing, deleting, bulk actions, persistence) have been carefully mapped from the original React/TypeScript TodoMVC app to Angular with NgRx. This confirms that the business logic remains intact.
