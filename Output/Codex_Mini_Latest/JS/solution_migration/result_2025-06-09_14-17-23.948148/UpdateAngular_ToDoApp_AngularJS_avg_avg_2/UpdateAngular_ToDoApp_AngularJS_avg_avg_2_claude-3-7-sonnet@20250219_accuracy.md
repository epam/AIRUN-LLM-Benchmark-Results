# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])
- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed

    Only `ngOnChanges` is explicitly implemented in the TodoFocusDirective. Other components might benefit from explicit lifecycle hooks, but none are strictly required in this implementation as they handle their logic without them.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions
- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings

    Based on the code review, there are no explicit console errors. However, without running the application, I can't be 100% certain there wouldn't be any runtime errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design
