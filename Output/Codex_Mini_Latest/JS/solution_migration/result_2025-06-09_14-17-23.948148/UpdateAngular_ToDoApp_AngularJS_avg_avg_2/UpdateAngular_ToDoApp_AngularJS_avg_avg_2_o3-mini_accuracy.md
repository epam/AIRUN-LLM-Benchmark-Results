# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The scaffold command and explicit mention in the migration details confirm Angular 14.x is used.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
  The entire codebase uses ES module syntax (import/export) and explicitly states that RequireJS is removed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
  The application includes StoreModule configuration (both forRoot and forFeature) and utilizes selectors and dispatches actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
  Effects are clearly defined using createEffect, and EffectsModule is configured for both root and feature modules.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
  The code contains defined actions, reducers, selectors, and effects handling todo operations, ensuring a complete NgRx cycle.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
  The TodoStorageService is decorated with @Injectable using providedIn: 'root', making it globally injectable.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
  The TodoStorageService correctly uses localStorage’s getItem/JSON.parse and setItem/JSON.stringify to persist todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
  All components (e.g., AppComponent, TodoFormComponent, TodoListComponent) include @Component metadata with template and style references.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
  The custom directives (TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective) are correctly defined with the @Directive decorator.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
  Templates make use of Angular structural directives like *ngIf and *ngFor appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
  Event binding is consistently applied in templates with correct syntax such as (click), (ngSubmit), and (blur).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
  The code utilizes property binding, for example, [ngClass] for CSS classes and [checked] for checkbox state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
  The TodoFocusDirective uses ngOnChanges appropriately. Other components do not require additional lifecycle hooks given their responsibilities.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
  Data models are defined through the Todo interface and the FilterType type.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
  Components and services correctly declare dependencies via constructor parameters and Angular’s DI system.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The project structure (core vs. feature modules), use of OnPush change detection, and separation of concerns adhere well to Angular’s style guidelines.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
  Based on a static analysis of the code, no erroneous patterns or warnings are apparent. (Note: Actual runtime errors cannot be ruled out without executing the code, but the static structure is solid.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
  TypeScript features like explicit types, interfaces for models, and appropriate use of type inference are applied correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
  The provided code is clean with no lingering TODO comments or blocks of commented-out code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design  
  Components, directives, and services each have focused responsibilities, clearly separating concerns (e.g., state management, view rendering, and data persistence).
