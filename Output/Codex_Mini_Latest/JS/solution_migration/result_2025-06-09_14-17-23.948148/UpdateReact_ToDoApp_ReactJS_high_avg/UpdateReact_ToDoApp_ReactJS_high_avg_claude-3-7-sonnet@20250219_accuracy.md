- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all React imports use React 18.x compatible syntax
  
  The code uses React 18.x compatible syntax throughout, including `createRoot` from `react-dom/client` and imports of React hooks.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all components use functional component syntax with hooks instead of class components
  
  All components (App, TodoList, TodoItem, TodoFooter) are implemented as functional components using hooks like useState, useEffect, useCallback, and useRef.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Redux Toolkit's createSlice is used for state management
  
  Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` is properly used in the `todosSlice.ts` file for state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for all props, state, and Redux store
  
  TypeScript interfaces are defined for all components props, Todo item structure, TodosState, and Redux store with proper typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses immutable state updates in reducers
  
  The Redux Toolkit slice uses Immer-powered reducers for immutable state updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that nanoid is used for ID generation instead of custom UUID implementation
  
  The code uses `nanoid` from the nanoid package for ID generation as specified in the `todosSlice.ts` file.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application uses React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate
  
  React.memo is applied to TodoList, TodoItem, and TodoFooter components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that useCallback is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  
  The useCallback hook is appropriately used for event handlers in App.tsx and TodoList.tsx.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage handling is implemented in a modern way
  
  Modern localStorage handling is implemented using a dedicated Redux middleware and proper JSON parsing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows consistent naming conventions throughout the application
  
  The code follows consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper error handling is implemented where necessary
  
  Proper error handling is implemented, including checking for a missing root element in index.tsx and input validation in form handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware
  
  The Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware, including a custom localStorage persistence middleware.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React.lazy is used for code splitting where appropriate
  
  React.lazy and Suspense are used for code splitting TodoList and TodoFooter components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the codebase has no TODOs remaining
  
  There are no TODOs remaining in the codebase as explicitly mentioned in the summary of changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux Provider wraps the application entry point
  
  The Redux Provider properly wraps the application entry point in index.tsx.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure strict TypeScript type checking is implemented throughout the application
  
  Strict TypeScript type checking is enabled in tsconfig.json with the "strict": true option, and all components have proper type annotations.
