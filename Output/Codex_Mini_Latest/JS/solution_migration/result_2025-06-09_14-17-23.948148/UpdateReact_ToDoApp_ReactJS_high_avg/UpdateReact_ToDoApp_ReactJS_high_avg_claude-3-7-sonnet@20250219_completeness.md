# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed
  
  The code in `App.tsx` handles the key press event correctly with the `handleNewKeyDown` function that checks for the Enter key and dispatches the `addTodo` action when triggered.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter
  
  The `TodoList.tsx` component properly filters todos based on the current filter value (all, active, completed) before rendering them.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos
  
  The toggle all functionality is implemented in `App.tsx` with the `handleToggleAll` function and the corresponding checkbox input that dispatches the `toggleAll` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted
  
  The `TodoItem.tsx` component includes the necessary functionality to toggle, edit, and delete individual todos through the provided handler props.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode
  
  The `TodoItem.tsx` component implements the `handleDoubleClick` function that sets the component into editing mode when a double-click occurs.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo
  
  The `handleKeyDown` function in `TodoItem.tsx` checks for the Enter key and calls the `commitEdit` function to submit the edited todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value
  
  The `handleKeyDown` function in `TodoItem.tsx` also checks for the Escape key, resets the edited title to the original value, and exits editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The `TodoFooter.tsx` component displays the active count with proper pluralization of "item" or "items".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The `TodoFooter.tsx` component includes links for all three filter types (All, Active, Completed) with proper URL hash links.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos
  
  A "Clear completed" button is implemented in the `TodoFooter.tsx` component that calls the `onClearCompleted` handler when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence
  
  The application uses a middleware in `store.ts` to persist todos to localStorage whenever a todos-related action is dispatched, and loads from localStorage during initialization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state
  
  The application conditionally renders the main section and footer based on the presence of todos, and the "Clear completed" button is only shown when there are completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count
  
  The `TodoFooter.tsx` component correctly pluralizes "item" based on the active count with the line: `const itemWord = activeCount === 1 ? "item" : "items";`

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components
  
  The application is well-structured with separate components for `App`, `TodoList`, `TodoItem`, and `TodoFooter`, each with focused responsibilities.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality
  
  The code is organized by feature with a clear directory structure, including a `features/todos` directory containing all todo-related components and logic.
