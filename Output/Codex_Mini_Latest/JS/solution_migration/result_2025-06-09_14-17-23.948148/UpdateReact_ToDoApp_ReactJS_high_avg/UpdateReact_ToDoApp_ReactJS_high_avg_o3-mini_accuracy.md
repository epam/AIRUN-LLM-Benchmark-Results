# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all React imports use React 18.x compatible syntax  
  The code uses "react-dom/client" with createRoot, which is the correct React 18 approach.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all components use functional component syntax with hooks instead of class components  
  All provided components are written as functional components and make use of hooks like useState, useEffect, and useCallback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Redux Toolkit's createSlice is used for state management  
  The todosSlice is created using createSlice from Redux Toolkit, confirming modern state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for all props, state, and Redux store  
  Interfaces such as Todo, TodosState, and explicit types for Redux hooks (RootState, AppDispatch) are defined.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses immutable state updates in reducers  
  Redux Toolkitâ€™s built-in Immer ensures immutability, and the reducers are written accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that nanoid is used for ID generation instead of custom UUID implementation  
  The todosSlice uses the nanoid function for generating unique IDs.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application uses React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate  
  Components like TodoList, TodoItem, and TodoFooter are wrapped with React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that useCallback is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders  
  Event handlers such as handleNewKeyDown and handleToggleAll are wrapped in useCallback hooks.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage handling is implemented in a modern way  
  Local storage is handled via middleware in the Redux store and state is hydrated from localStorage at initialization.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows consistent naming conventions throughout the application  
  The code displays consistent naming for files, variables, and components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper error handling is implemented where necessary  
  The index.tsx file includes error handling to throw an error if the root container is missing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware  
  The Redux store is configured using getDefaultMiddleware and the custom localStorageMiddleware is concatenated appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React.lazy is used for code splitting where appropriate  
  Both TodoList and TodoFooter are code-split using React.lazy and wrapped in React.Suspense.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the codebase has no TODOs remaining  
  The provided code does not contain any TODO comments.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux Provider wraps the application entry point  
  The index.tsx file wraps the App component with <Provider store={store}>.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure strict TypeScript type checking is implemented throughout the application  
  The tsconfig.json file has strict mode enabled, and the code uses strong TypeScript typing throughout.
