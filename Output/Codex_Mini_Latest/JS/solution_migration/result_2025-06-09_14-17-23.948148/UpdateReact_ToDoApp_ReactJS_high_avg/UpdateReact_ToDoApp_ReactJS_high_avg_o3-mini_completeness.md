# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The input in App.tsx listens for the Enter key in the handleNewKeyDown callback and dispatches addTodo when pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The TodoList component filters todos based on the current filter ("all", "active", or "completed") and maps them correctly to TodoItem components.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  The App.tsx component includes an input checkbox (with id "toggle-all") that dispatches the toggleAll action to update the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  The TodoItem component implements onToggle, onEdit, and onDelete callbacks, which are properly supplied from the parent components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  The TodoItem component sets its editing state to true on a double-click event on the label, enabling the input for edit.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  Within the TodoItem’s handleKeyDown function, pressing Enter calls the commitEdit function, which submits the updated todo title.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  In the TodoItem component, if the Escape key is pressed, it resets the editing state and restores the todo title from the original state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooter component correctly renders the activeCount as part of its display, showing the number of items left.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The TodoFooter component provides three links (All, Active, and Completed) that update the filter state when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  A clear-completed button is conditionally rendered in the TodoFooter if there are any completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  The store.ts file includes a middleware that saves the todos slice to localStorage on every todos-related action, and the initial state is hydrated from localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  Elements such as the main section and footer are only rendered when there are todos or when the counts indicate visibility (active or completed todos).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  The TodoFooter component dynamically determines the singular “item” or plural “items” based on the activeCount value.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The application is broken down into distinct components such as App, TodoList, TodoItem, and TodoFooter, which each manage a single aspect of the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The project uses a structured folder layout (e.g., a dedicated features/todos folder) and separates concerns with specific files for the store, hooks, and components.
