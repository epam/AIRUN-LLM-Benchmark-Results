# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration
  
  The code shows clear evidence of React 18 with TypeScript setup, including the use of `create-react-app --template typescript` in the scaffolding instructions, import of React types (`React.FC`, `MouseEvent`), and use of TypeScript-specific files with `.tsx` and `.ts` extensions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure
  
  The code defines clear TypeScript interfaces in `soundMapper.ts`, including:
  - A `Note` type using a union type for all possible piano notes
  - A `SoundMapper` interface that properly types the audio mapping object
  - Proper typing of the `HTMLAudioElement` for each note

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks
  
  All components are implemented as functional components using the React.FC type:
  - `App` uses useState and useCallback hooks
  - `Piano` is a functional component with useState and useCallback
  - `PianoKey` is a functional component (wrapped in React.memo)
  - `ToggleSwitch` and `FullscreenButton` are functional components

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)
  
  The application uses React hooks correctly:
  - `useState` for tracking active notes and display preferences (`showLetter`)
  - `useCallback` for memoizing event handlers
  - `useEffect` for setting up and cleaning up keyboard event listeners

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels
  
  Keyboard event handlers are implemented at the App level (the appropriate high level) using:
  - `keyDownHandler` and `keyUpHandler` functions
  - Proper event listener registration/cleanup in useEffect
  - Appropriate delegation to find piano keys based on keyboard input

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions are implemented using React synthetic events
  
  The implementation properly uses React synthetic events:
  - `onMouseDown`, `onMouseUp`, `onMouseOut` in PianoKey component
  - `onMouseMove` in Piano component for drag-and-play functionality
  - Event handlers use React's synthetic event system correctly

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment
  
  Audio resources are correctly implemented:
  - Audio files are properly placed in the public directory
  - Audio elements are initialized once using the `soundMapper` object
  - Audio playback uses proper methods (play, reset currentTime)
  - Uses `process.env.PUBLIC_URL` to correctly reference audio files

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility
  
  The FullscreenButton component:
  - Uses optional chaining (`?.`) for browser compatibility
  - Checks for `document.fullscreenElement` before toggling
  - Uses `requestFullscreen` and `exitFullscreen` methods
  - Is implemented as a memoized functional component

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns
  
  The code follows React patterns for conditional class names:
  - Uses array filtering and joining in PianoKey: `classNames = ['piano-key', isSharp ? 'sharp' : '', ...].filter(Boolean).join(' ')`
  - Uses template literals for conditional classes: `` `piano${showLetter ? ' letters' : ''}` ``
  - Uses template literals with ternary operators for button active states

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate
  
  The code uses React.memo appropriately:
  - `PianoKey` component is memoized to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - `Piano` component is memoized
  - `FullscreenButton` is memoized
  - `useCallback` is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary rerenders

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations
  
  Audio playback is handled correctly:
  - Audio elements are initialized once in the `soundMapper.ts` file
  - `currentTime` is reset before playback to allow re-triggering of notes
  - Active notes state management handles multiple simultaneous notes
  - Note release is properly implemented

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application
  
  The code demonstrates strict TypeScript typing:
  - Explicit interfaces for all component props (`PianoKeyProps`, `PianoProps`, etc.)
  - Union type for `Note` to restrict values to valid notes
  - Explicit return types for functional components (`React.FC<PropType>`)
  - Type assertions where needed (`as Note`, `as HTMLElement`)
  - Generic type parameters for React hooks (`useState<Note[]>`)
