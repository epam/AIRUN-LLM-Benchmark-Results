# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration  
  The solution clearly shows instructions to create a React 18 + TypeScript app using Create React App and specifies the corresponding project scaffolding steps.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure  
  The provided code includes a "soundMapper.ts" module with a defined "SoundMapper" interface and a "Note" union type to ensure strict typing for audio resources.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks  
  Each component (App, Piano, PianoKey, ToggleSwitch, FullscreenButton) is implemented as a functional component. Hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useCallback are properly used throughout.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)  
  The application manages state effectively via hooks. For instance, "activeNotes" and "showLetter" are managed in App using useState, and event listeners are setup and cleaned up with useEffect.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels  
  Global keyboard handlers are correctly implemented in the App component and attached using useEffect, ensuring that the appropriate note is played or released based on key events.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events  
  The PianoKey and Piano components correctly utilize React's synthetic event system for handling mouse events such as onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseOut, and onMouseMove.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment  
  Audio elements are instantiated only once in the "soundMapper.ts" module and reused throughout the application, ensuring proper resource management in a React context.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility  
  The FullscreenButton component handles full screen toggling using standard browser API methods (requestFullscreen and exitFullscreen) with appropriate checks, encapsulated within a React.memo component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns  
  Conditional classes in the PianoKey component are built via JavaScript array filtering and joining, which is an appropriate React pattern for managing dynamic class names.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate  
  The solution employs React.memo on components such as PianoKey, Piano, and FullscreenButton to prevent unnecessary re-renders, showcasing a good attention to performance.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations  
  Audio playback is managed correctly with event handlers and proper state updates. The playNote function resets the audio time and plays the clip while the releaseNote function updates state appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application  
  The entire codebase adheres to strict TypeScript typing, from component props interfaces to a strongly typed audio mapping, ensuring type safety.
