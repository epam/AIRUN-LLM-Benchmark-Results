# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'  
  The App component includes a header with an h1 element whose text is "Virtual Piano".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons  
  The ToggleSwitch component renders two buttons—one for "Notes" and one for "Letters"—within a container.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)  
  The Piano component maps over defined arrays for WHITE_KEYS and BLACK_KEYS, rendering both natural and sharp keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes  
  Each PianoKey component is rendered with the corresponding data attributes (data-note and data-letter), ensuring proper identification.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked  
  The onMouseDown event in PianoKey triggers the onPlay callback, and the App component uses the soundMapper to play the correct audio associated with each note.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)  
  Active piano keys receive the "piano-key-active" CSS class when pressed, as managed by the active state in the App component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes  
  Keyboard event listeners in the App component (keydown and keyup) query for elements using the data-letter attribute and trigger the correct play/release actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked  
  The ToggleSwitch component updates the showLetter state, and the Piano component conditionally adds the "letters" class based on that state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes  
  The FullscreenButton component uses the browser’s fullscreen API (requestFullscreen/exitFullscreen) to toggle the view appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly  
  The state management in the App component (maintaining an array of activeNotes) allows for multiple keys to be pressed at the same time.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys  
  The Piano component tracks the mouseDown state and uses onMouseMove events to detect and play keys as the pointer moves across them.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information  
  The footer element in the App component includes a container that displays the year "2020".
