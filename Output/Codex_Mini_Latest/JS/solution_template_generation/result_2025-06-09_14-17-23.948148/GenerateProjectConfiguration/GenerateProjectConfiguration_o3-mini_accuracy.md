# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Vite is configured as the build tool with appropriate configuration files  
  The answer provides a clear vite.config.ts file with proper configuration for plugins and testing using Vitest.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm TypeScript is properly configured with a tsconfig.json file containing correct compiler options  
  The provided tsconfig.json includes modern compiler options and is correctly set up for a React + TypeScript project.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the React setup includes necessary entry points and proper component structure  
  The project includes src/main.tsx as the entry point, an App component, and route-based components for Home and About, indicating a correct React setup.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that Redux is implemented with appropriate store configuration, reducers, and actions  
  Redux is configured using Redux Toolkit with a dedicated store in src/store and a counterSlice in src/features/counter, meeting the required implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify React Router is correctly configured with defined routes and navigation components  
  The App component uses BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route to define paths ("/" and "/about") along with proper navigation links, satisfying this step.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure testing libraries are properly configured with appropriate test setup files  
  The testing setup includes Vitest configuration in vite.config.ts, a setupTests.ts file that imports the necessary testing-library extensions, and tests in src/App.test.tsx.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate package.json includes correct dependencies with compatible version specifications  
  The package.json correctly lists essential dependencies (React, Redux Toolkit, React Router, etc.) alongside accurate devDependencies for TypeScript, Vite, and testing libraries.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm package.json contains scripts for development, building, and testing operations  
  Multiple scripts (dev, build, preview, test, test:watch, coverage) are provided in package.json, ensuring the project can be built, developed, and tested efficiently.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the project structure follows modern React development conventions  
  The project structure, including separate folders for components, features, routes, and store, reflects best practices in modern React development.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that configuration files are production‑ready with appropriate optimization settings  
  Both vite.config.ts and tsconfig.json appear production‑ready, featuring proper settings for code compilation, testing, and build optimization.
