# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist
  
  The test suite includes a dedicated "Basic rendering and props" section with tests for rendering with default props, placeholder visibility, and proper attribute application.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present
  
  The test suite includes a "Keyboard interaction" section that tests arrow key navigation, Enter key selection, Escape key for closing the menu, Space key to open the menu, and Backspace/Delete keys for clearing values.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)
  
  Tests for mouse interactions are present, including clicking on the control to open the menu, clicking on options to select them, and clicking on the clear indicator to remove values.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior
  
  The test suite only tests the component in controlled mode by explicitly providing value, inputValue, and callback handlers. There are no tests for uncontrolled behavior (where the component manages its own state).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values
  
  Tests for selecting values (via clicking and keyboard), removing values (via backspace and clear button), and clearing all values are present in the test suite.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented
  
  The "Opening/closing menu" section thoroughly tests menu opening via click, closing via Escape key, and closing via outside clicks (touch simulation).

- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality
  
  The test suite includes filtering functionality in the "Option selection & filtering" section, testing input-based filtering of options.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist
  
  A dedicated "Multi-select behavior" section tests selecting multiple values and removing values in multi-select mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility
  
  The "Accessibility attributes" section tests aria-activedescendant, aria-controls, aria-expanded attributes, and the presence of a live region for screen reader updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested
  
  The "Edge cases" section tests scenarios like no matching options and handling of loadingMessage returning null.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states
  
  Loading state is tested in the "Edge cases" section with the isLoading prop and loadingMessage handler.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states
  
  Tests for both disabled component state (isDisabled prop) and disabled options are present in the test suite.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance
  
  A "Performance smoke test" section tests rendering 1000 options and verifies that it happens in under 100ms.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested
  
  While there are some tests that involve focus (focusing the combobox before keyboard events), comprehensive focus management testing throughout user interactions is not fully covered. For example, there's no explicit test for focus behavior after selection or tab navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering
  
  The test suite verifies placeholder rendering in the basic rendering tests and implicitly tests value rendering when setting up tests with initial values.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations
  
  The "Customization hooks" section specifically tests the formatOptionLabel custom prop with a mock formatter.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)
  
  All callback functions are mocked and tested throughout the test suite to verify they're called at the appropriate times with the expected arguments.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)
  
  The test suite includes tests for the clear indicator, but doesn't explicitly test the dropdown indicator and loading indicator rendering or behavior.
