# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up in the test file  
  The answer includes a proper Jest configuration file (jest.config.js), a setup file (jest.setup.ts) for importing Testing Library matchers, and the installation of required dev‑dependencies via npm. This setup confirms that both Jest and React Testing Library are correctly integrated into the testing environment.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test cases are properly isolated and do not have interdependencies  
  The test suite uses multiple describe and it blocks with clear isolation of test cases. The use of afterEach for clearing mocks (jest.clearAllMocks()) further ensures that tests are independent of each other.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that DOM events are simulated using proper React Testing Library methods  
  The tests simulate events using React Testing Library’s userEvent and fireEvent. These methods are appropriately used to mimic user interactions, such as clicks, key presses, and touch events.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that accessibility attributes are being tested appropriately  
  Accessibility is tested by verifying attributes like aria-label, aria-labelledby, aria-controls, and aria-expanded. Additionally, a live region (role="status" with hidden attribute) is checked to ensure proper feedback for assistive technologies.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure mocks are used for external dependencies where appropriate  
  The code makes effective use of jest.fn() to create mock functions for external callbacks (e.g., onChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose, onInputChange) to verify interactions without invoking real implementations.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify proper use of async/await for asynchronous testing where needed  
  Although the test suite does not explicitly use async/await constructs, none of the component interactions appear to require asynchronous handling. This seems acceptable given the synchronous behavior under test. A slight deduction in confidence is due to the absence of any explicit asynchronous behavior testing, but in this context it does not impact the validity of the tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all assertions use appropriate Jest matchers  
  The test cases employ proper Jest matchers such as toBeInTheDocument, toHaveAttribute, toBeDisabled, and toHaveBeenCalledWith. These matchers effectively validate the UI states and behaviors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that tests include proper cleanup after each test case  
  The utilization of afterEach with jest.clearAllMocks() ensures that any side effects from one test do not leak into another. Additionally, React Testing Library performs automatic DOM cleanup between tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test descriptions clearly indicate what functionality is being tested  
  Each test and describe block is named descriptively (e.g., “Basic rendering and props”, “Opening/closing menu”, “Keyboard interaction”) which clearly indicates the intent and functionality being tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the test file follows best practices for organizing test cases (describe/it blocks)  
  The test suite is well-organized using nested describe and it blocks which group related tests logically. This structure adheres to standard testing best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that all event handlers are tested using appropriate simulation methods  
  Event handlers are tested using the appropriate simulation methods such as userEvent.click for mouse interactions and fireEvent.keyDown for keyboard events, ensuring that all behaviors are correctly triggered and validated.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the test environment correctly simulates both mouse and keyboard interactions  
  The tests adequately cover both mouse interactions (e.g., clicking on options and clear indicators) and keyboard interactions (e.g., navigating with Arrow keys, selecting with Enter, and triggering actions with Space, Backspace, and Escape).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for touch events properly simulate mobile interactions  
  The test suite simulates mobile touch interactions using act() with a new TouchEvent for touchend, thereby correctly validating mobile-specific event handling.
