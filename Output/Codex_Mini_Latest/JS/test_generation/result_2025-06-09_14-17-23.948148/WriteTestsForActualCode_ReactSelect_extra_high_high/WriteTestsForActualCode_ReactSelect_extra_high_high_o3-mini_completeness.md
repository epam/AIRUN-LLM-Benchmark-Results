# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist  
  The test suite includes a "Basic rendering and props" section that verifies the component renders without crashing, displays the placeholder, applies ARIA attributes, and handles the disabled state.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present  
  While the tests cover ArrowDown, ArrowUp, Enter, Escape, Backspace, and Space key interactions, there is no explicit test for Tab navigation. This omission prevents full coverage of the keyboard navigation functionality based on the evaluation criteria.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)  
  The test suite covers mouse clicks on controls and options, but there are no tests addressing mouse hover interactions.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior  
  The tests consistently use controlled behavior by providing props (e.g., state via props, controlled open/close). There is no explicit test demonstrating uncontrolled behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values  
  The tests verify that selecting an option, clearing a selection (via clear icon or key events), and removing values correctly trigger the corresponding state changes and callbacks.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented  
  The suite tests menu opening on clicking the control and closing the menu via Escape key and touch event simulations.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality  
  There is a test that verifies input-based filtering, which confirms that typing filters the options appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist  
  The "Multi‑select behavior" section includes tests for selecting multiple values and clearing them via the clear icon.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility  
  Tests are present that check for ARIA attributes (such as aria-label, aria-labelledby, aria-controls, aria-expanded) and a live region for screen readers.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested  
  A test checks that when no matching options are found (using an input value of 'zzz'), a no-options message ("Nada") is rendered.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states  
  The suite tests loading behavior by checking that the menu is hidden when the loadingMessage returns null; however, there are no tests that cover error states.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states  
  The test suite verifies that the component renders as disabled when the "isDisabled" prop is true and that clicking on a disabled option does not trigger an onChange callback.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance  
  A performance smoke test is implemented that renders 1000 options and asserts that rendering completes in under 100ms.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested  
  Several tests ensure that focus is appropriately managed – for instance, setting focus on the combobox before key events and verifying that certain interactions (like selection on key press) occur when focus is active.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering  
  The placeholder is explicitly tested in the basic rendering section, confirming its presence in the document.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations  
  A test confirms that when a custom formatOptionLabel function is provided, it is called and its output is rendered correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)  
  The tests properly mock and assert the callback functions for various interactions across the test suite.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)  
  While there is a test verifying the clear indicator and a loading state (via loadingMessage), there is no explicit test for the dropdown indicator component.
