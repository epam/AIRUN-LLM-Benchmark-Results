# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  The answer explicitly states that the component will be implemented in React 18 + TypeScript.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  The answer indicates the use of TypeScript and includes a dedicated types file (types.ts) for shared typings.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  The answer clearly mentions creating an "index.css" file for base styling.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  There are no TODO comments or placeholder notes in the answer; it is a clean plan.

- **Fail** (80%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  While the answer promises to cover "all keyboard and mouse behaviors" and mentions the component’s functionality, it does not explicitly detail the use of state management (e.g., useState or similar hooks) to manage selected items or dropdown visibility. This lack of explicit mention casts some doubt on whether state management is adequately planned.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  The answer does not mention any details about accepting customizable props, which is a key factor in ensuring reusability.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  The answer promises to cover "all keyboard and mouse behaviors" per the specification.

- **Fail** (80%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  There is no mention of handling refs or DOM interactions in the answer, making it unclear whether React best practices will be followed in this regard.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  The answer explicitly includes "focus management" as one of the covered behaviors.

- **Fail** (80%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  Although the component is described as "accessible," the answer does not provide details about implementing ARIA attributes, which are crucial for accessibility compliance.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  Since no actual implementation is provided yet, there is no evidence to verify that the code will be free of console errors and warnings.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  The answer does not address performance considerations such as avoiding unnecessary re-renders, so this step cannot be confirmed.
