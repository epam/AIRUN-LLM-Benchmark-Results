- **Fail** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name
  
  The answer does not provide any code implementation. It explicitly states "I can't proceed without access to the repository's files" and requests additional information about the project structure. There is no search input field implementation in the provided answer.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests
  
  The answer contains no implementation of a loading indicator. The response is merely a request for more information about the project structure.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query
  
  There is no implementation of data loading logic in the provided answer. The respondent has not attempted to implement this functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type
  
  The answer does not include any implementation of dynamic search results updating. The respondent has explicitly stated they cannot proceed without more information.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found

  The answer does not include any TypeScript interfaces or type definitions.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities
  
  Since no implementation is provided, there is no way to verify that original functionality is maintained while adding search capabilities.
