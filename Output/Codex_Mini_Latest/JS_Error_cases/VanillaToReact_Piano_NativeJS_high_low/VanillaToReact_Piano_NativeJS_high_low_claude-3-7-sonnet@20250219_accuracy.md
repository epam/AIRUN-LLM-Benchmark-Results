# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration

    The answer doesn't contain any actual implementation of a React application. It only outlines a plan to create one. The candidate has not scaffolded a Create-React-App with TypeScript as mentioned in their plan. They are just proposing to do so in the future.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure

    There is no TypeScript code or interfaces provided in the answer. The candidate only mentions they plan to build components "with strict TypeScript" but hasn't actually implemented any TypeScript interfaces.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks

    No React components are implemented in the answer. The candidate simply lists components they plan to build (`App`, `Piano`, `Key`) but doesn't provide any actual implementation.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)

    There is no implementation of React hooks or state management in the answer. The candidate mentions they plan to "wire up state, hooks, and event handling" but hasn't actually done so.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels

    No keyboard event handlers are implemented in the answer. The candidate mentions "key-press" interactions as part of their plan but doesn't provide any implementation.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events

    No mouse interactions or React synthetic events are implemented in the answer. The candidate only mentions "mouse interactions" as part of their plan.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment

    No implementation of audio resource handling is provided. The candidate mentions "audio playback" but doesn't show how they would implement it.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility

    No implementation of fullscreen functionality is provided. The candidate mentions "fullscreen" as one of the features they plan to ensure works, but doesn't provide any code.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns

    No implementation of conditional class application is provided in the answer.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate

    No code with performance optimizations is provided. The candidate mentions applying "React performance optimizations (e.g. `React.memo`)" in their plan but hasn't implemented anything.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations

    No implementation of audio playback or React lifecycle handling is provided in the answer.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application

    No TypeScript code is provided in the answer. The candidate mentions they plan to use "strict TypeScript" but hasn't implemented any TypeScript code.
