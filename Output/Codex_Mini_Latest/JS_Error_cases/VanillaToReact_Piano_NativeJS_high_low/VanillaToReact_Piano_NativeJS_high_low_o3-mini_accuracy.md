# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (80%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration  
  Although the plan states that a Create‑React‑App with TypeScript will be scaffolded, it does not mention using React 18 explicitly. Without an explicit reference, we cannot be certain that React 18 is being targeted.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure  
  The answer does not mention using TypeScript interfaces to define or enforce the structure for audio mapping. The plan mainly concentrates on asset conversion and migration, without details concerning interfaces for audio.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks  
  The plan indicates that components such as `App`, `Piano`, `Key`, etc. will be built out with strict TypeScript and that hooks (state and event handling) will be wired up. Although it does not explicitly state “functional components,” the intended use of hooks implies a functional component approach. The slight ambiguity prevents a full 100% confidence.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)  
  The answer mentions “wire up state, hooks, and event handling” which implies that the state management using React patterns (likely including `useState` and `useEffect`) is intended. However, no explicit details are provided, so there is a small uncertainty.

- **Fail** (70%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels  
  The plan mentions ensuring key‑press interactions behave identically to the vanilla JS version, but it lacks specifics on how keyboard events will be managed at the correct component levels. This vagueness causes some doubt.

- **Fail** (70%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events  
  Although the plan refers to “mouse interactions” alongside key‑press interactions, it does not provide any details about leveraging React synthetic events for mouse events. The lack of specifics implies a likely issue in meeting the requirement.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment  
  The answer indicates that audio playback should behave identically and that audio assets will be copied/converting, implying that audio is considered. However, it does not detail how these resources will be managed within React (e.g., via refs or dedicated components), hence the confidence is slightly less than complete.

- **Fail** (70%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility  
  The plan simply states to “ensure fullscreen” but does not elaborate on how React patterns or browser compatibility concerns will be addressed for fullscreen functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns  
  There is no mention of any conditional class application using React patterns in the provided plan.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate  
  The answer explicitly mentions applying React performance optimizations (e.g. `React.memo`), satisfying this step.

- **Fail** (70%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations  
  Although the plan states that visual and functional equivalence to the vanilla JS version is desired for audio playback, it does not provide details on managing playback using React lifecycle methods. This omission raises concerns about meeting this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application  
  The plan clearly mentions building components with “strict TypeScript,” which indicates an intention to follow TypeScript strict typing guidelines throughout the application.
