# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title "Virtual Piano"  
  The provided answer does not mention rendering any header or ensuring that the header contains the title "Virtual Piano". This omission indicates that this requirement was not addressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with "Notes" and "Letters" toggle buttons  
  The answer explicitly states that there will be a notes/letters toggle, which implies that these toggle buttons will exist even if the container is not elaborated upon.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)  
  The answer mentions building out the Piano and Key components to match the vanilla JS version. Although it does not explicitly state that all keys (both natural and sharps) will be rendered, it is reasonable to assume that the migration will preserve this behavior. Confidence is a bit lower because the plan does not detail the key configuration explicitly.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes  
  There is no mention of adding or managing data attributes for letters and notes on each piano key. The plan is high-level and does not address this specific detail.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked  
  The answer states that audio playback will behave identically to the vanilla JS version. While the plan is high-level, it does signal that correct audio playback is a requirement. The 90% confidence reflects that the plan might lack concrete implementation details.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)  
  There is no explicit reference to visual feedback such as key highlighting when pressed, despite the mention of wiring up interactions. This specific behavior is not clearly addressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes  
  The answer implies that keyboard input will be wired up to mimic the vanilla JS version. This suggests that keyboard interactions, including playing the corresponding notes, are intended.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked  
  The plan clearly includes a notes/letters toggle, which covers this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes  
  The plan explicitly mentions ensuring fullscreen behavior. This indicates there is an intention to support toggling between normal and fullscreen modes.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly  
  The answer does not address the handling of multiple simultaneous key presses. This specific interaction requirement is omitted in the plan.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys  
  There is a generic mention of mouse interactions, but there is no specific reference to handling mouse drag functionality across keys. Therefore, this requirement is not clearly satisfied.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information  
  The plan makes no mention of adding a footer containing year information. This functionality is completely absent.
