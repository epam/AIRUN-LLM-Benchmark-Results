# Evaluation Report

## Readability

### 1. Inconsistent Naming Convention
**Pass**: The code uses different naming styles for promises, and the suggestion to use more descriptive names is valid.

### 2. Ambiguous Variable Names
**Pass**: The variable 'data' is too generic, and the suggestion to use more specific names like 'deleteResponse' is appropriate.

## Maintainability

### 1. Duplicated Code in Save Logic
**Pass**: The code contains repetitive logic for handling new and existing pages, and the suggestion to unify the save handler is valid.

### 2. Tight Coupling with REST Services
**Pass**: The controller directly uses REST services, and the suggestion to create a service layer is appropriate.

## Performance

### 1. Multiple Sequential API Calls
**Pass**: The deletePage() function makes several independent DELETE calls, and the suggestion to parallelize them using $q.all() is valid.

### 2. Unbounded Tag Suggestions
**Pass**: The autocompleteTags() function makes API calls on every keystroke without debouncing, and the suggestion to add debouncing is appropriate.

## Accessibility

### 1. Improper Form Label Association
**Pass**: The input elements use 'value' attribute instead of 'id' for label association, and the suggestion to fix this is valid.

### 2. Missing ARIA Attributes for Dynamic Content
**Pass**: The tag suggestions popup lacks ARIA attributes, and the suggestion to add them is appropriate.

## Best Practices

### 1. AngularJS Resource Promise Handling
**Pass**: The code uses callback functions instead of proper promise chaining, and the suggestion to use $promise is valid.

### 2. State Management in Factories
**Pass**: The Page and Users factories use mutable objects, and the suggestion to use constructor functions is appropriate.

## Testing

### 1. Tight Coupling to REST Services
**Pass**: Direct REST service usage in the controller makes testing difficult, and the suggestion to use a mockable service is valid.

### 2. Complex Controller Logic
**Pass**: The controller has multiple responsibilities, and the suggestion to split it into components is appropriate.

## Documentation

### 1. Missing JSDoc Comments
**Pass**: Most functions lack documentation, and the suggestion to add JSDoc comments is valid.

### 2. Unclear Commented Code
**Pass**: There's dead code related to date formatting, and the suggestion to either remove or explain it is appropriate.
