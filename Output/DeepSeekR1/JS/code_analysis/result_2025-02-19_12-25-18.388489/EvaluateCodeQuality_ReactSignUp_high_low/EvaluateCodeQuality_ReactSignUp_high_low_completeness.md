# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### 1. Check if the `PropTypes` import from `react` is updated to import from the `prop-types` package.
**Pass**: The code correctly updates the `PropTypes` import from `react` to the `prop-types` package.
```js
import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
```

### 2. Verify that props are destructured in the `render` method to improve readability.
**Fail**: The provided code snippets do not show the `render` method with destructured props for readability.

### 3. Confirm that the code uses clear and concise variable names.
**Pass**: The code uses clear and concise variable names such as `errors`, `VALIDATION_RULES`, and `handleSubmit`.

### 4. Ensure that complex code blocks have explanatory comments for better understanding.
**Pass**: The code includes explanatory comments, especially in the documentation section with JSDoc comments.
```js
/**
 * Performs synchronous form validation
 * @param {Object} values - Form field values
 * @returns {Object} Validation errors object
 */
const validate = values => {
  // Validation logic
};
```

### 5. Check if functions are defined outside of the `render` method to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
**Pass**: The code defines functions outside of the `render` method, such as `handleSubmit` in the class property.
```js
class Signup extends React.Component {
  handleSubmit = (values) => {
    // handler logic
  }

  render() {
    const onSubmit = handleSubmit(this.handleSubmit);
    // ...
  }
}
```

### 6. Verify that validation logic is moved to a separate file to keep the component clean and maintainable.
**Fail**: The provided code snippets do not show the validation logic being moved to a separate file.

### 7. Ensure that repetitive code is refactored into reusable functions or components.
**Pass**: The code refactors repetitive validation rules into constants.
```js
const VALIDATION_RULES = {
  NAME_MIN: 3,
  NAME_MAX: 60,
  PASSWORD_MIN: 6
};
```

### 8. Confirm that the code adheres to a consistent coding style and conventions.
**Pass**: The code adheres to a consistent coding style and conventions, such as using camelCase for variable names and consistent indentation.

### 9. Ensure that functions are bound in the constructor instead of inline in the `render` method to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
**Pass**: The code uses class properties to avoid binding functions inline in the `render` method.
```js
class Signup extends React.Component {
  handleSubmit = (values) => {
    // handler logic
  }
}
```

### 10. Verify that any potential performance bottlenecks, such as unnecessary re-renders or heavy computations in the render method, are optimized.
**Pass**: The code optimizes performance by avoiding unnecessary promise wrapping and using async/await for better readability and performance.
```js
return api.signup(name, email, password)
  .then(result => this.actions.signupComplete(result.data))
  .catch(error => Promise.reject(error.data));
```

### 11. Check for the use of memoization techniques where applicable to improve performance.
**Fail**: The provided code snippets do not show the use of memoization techniques.
