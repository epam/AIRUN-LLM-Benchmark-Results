# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation includes a comprehensive component overview explaining the purpose and architecture
  
  The documentation starts with a clear component overview in section 1, including an introduction, architectural role description, and key features. It explains that this is an Angular.js module for content management with capabilities like page creation/editing, version control, content persistence, REST API integration, and user collaboration.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all major components (REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and Page controller) are documented
  
  All major components are documented in section 1.2 Architectural Role, with a table explaining the responsibilities of each component: REST Factory (API communication layer), Page Factory (Page state management), Users Factory (User session management), and pageCtrl (Presentation layer and business logic).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure all significant features of the page management system are described
  
  The documentation comprehensively describes the significant features of the page management system in sections 1.3 and 2.1, including draft autosaving, content versioning, tag management, publishing workflow, conflict detection, and multi-format content support.

- **Pass** (90%): Check that all form inputs and their behavior are documented
  
  The documentation covers the main page controller interface properties in section 3.2, including page.title, page.description, page.tags, and page.publish. While these are the primary inputs, I'm not 100% confident that all possible form inputs are documented, as there could be other implementation-specific inputs not covered.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page versioning and revision system
  
  The documentation thoroughly explains the page versioning and revision system in section 2.1.1, including code examples, implementation details about automatic revision creation, independent revision extras storage, atomic operations for data consistency, and revision chain maintenance.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation covers the tag system and autocomplete functionality
  
  The tag system and autocomplete functionality are covered in sections 1.3 (Key Features), 3.1 (REST Factory API), 3.2 (Page Controller Interface), and 5.1 (ARIA Implementation) which specifically mentions tag-suggestions with aria-live="polite" for dynamic content updates.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the documentation includes explanation of error handling and user notifications
  
  Error handling is mentioned in section 4.2 with a code example showing `.catch(handleError)` in the save process. Conflict detection and resolution are described in the draft management section (2.1.2) and in the conflict resolution example. However, comprehensive details about all notification types are not explicitly provided, which reduces my confidence slightly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page publishing workflow including scheduling
  
  The page publishing workflow including scheduling is explained in section 3.2, which shows that the page.publish property can have values 'Y'/'N'/'schedule' for different publication states. This is further supported by section 1.3 which mentions "Publishing workflow (immediate/scheduled)" as a key feature.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the documentation details how content extras and additional metadata are managed
  
  The documentation mentions "Independent revision extras storage" in section 2.1.1 and the "Flexible content modeling via extras system" in section 6.2. Additionally, section 6.1 references content compression for large extras. However, I'm not 100% confident that all aspects of extras management are fully detailed.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation explains how the UI interacts with the backend APIs
  
  Section 3.1 provides detailed information about the REST Factory API, including endpoints, methods, parameters, and return values. Section 4.2 provides code examples showing how the UI interacts with these APIs through the REST factory. The documentation also includes an architectural diagram reference showing these relationships.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes sample usage examples or patterns
  
  The documentation includes multiple code examples and common patterns throughout, particularly in sections 2.1.1 (revision creation example), 2.1.2 (localStorage integration), 4.1 (initialization), and 4.2 (saving content and conflict resolution patterns).

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the documentation explains all significant event broadcasting and inter-component communication
  
  The documentation includes information about inter-component communication in the architectural role section (1.2) and the m
