# Evaluation Report

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Confirm the component includes a search feature in the dropdown.**
   - **Pass**: The component filters options based on the `searchQuery` state, which is updated as the user types in the input field.

2. **Check that the component is navigable via keyboard.**
   - **Pass**: The component handles `ArrowDown`, `ArrowUp`, `Enter`, and `Escape` keys in the `handleInputKeyDown` function, allowing keyboard navigation.

3. **Verify items in the dropdown can be selected by pressing the Enter key.**
   - **Pass**: The `handleInputKeyDown` function checks for the `Enter` key and calls `handleSelect` to select the highlighted item.

4. **Confirm the dropdown list opens when Enter is pressed.**
   - **Pass**: The `handleInputKeyDown` function opens the dropdown if it is not already open when the `Enter` key is pressed.

5. **Ensure the focus returns to the select component after the dropdown is closed.**
   - **Pass**: The `handleSelect` function sets the focus back to the input field after an item is selected and the dropdown is closed.

6. **Verify the dropdown closes upon selecting an item via keyboard.**
   - **Pass**: The `handleSelect` function sets `isOpen` to `false`, closing the dropdown after an item is selected.

7. **Verify the dropdown closes upon selecting an item via mouse.**
   - **Pass**: The `onClick` event on the list item (`li`) calls `handleSelect`, which closes the dropdown.

8. **Confirm the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed.**
   - **Pass**: The `handleInputKeyDown` function sets `isOpen` to `false` when the `Escape` key is pressed.

9. **Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component.**
   - **Pass**: The `handleClickOutside` function, added as an event listener in the `useEffect` hook, closes the dropdown when a click is detected outside the component.
