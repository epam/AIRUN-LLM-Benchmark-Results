# Evaluation Report

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Ensure that the API call to https://swapi.dev/api/people is made using axios.**
    - **Pass**: The code uses `axios.get` to fetch data from `https://swapi.dev/api/people/`.

2. **Make sure the data is fetched initially without any input fields.**
    - **Pass**: The data is fetched on component mount using the `useEffect` hook without any input fields.

3. **Ensure a loader or loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.**
    - **Pass**: The code sets `isLoading` to `true` before the API call and displays a loader (`<div className="loader">Loading...</div>`) while data is being fetched.

4. **Verify that errors are logged to the console if the API call fails.**
    - **Fail**: The code sets an error message in the state (`setErrorMessage('Error fetching characters')`) and displays it in the UI, but it does not log the error to the console.

5. **Ensure that the fetched characters are displayed in a list format.**
    - **Pass**: The fetched characters are displayed in an unordered list (`<ul className="character-list">`), with each character rendered as a list item (`<li>`).

6. **Make sure each list item has a unique key derived from the character URL.**
    - **Pass**: Each list item has a unique key derived from the character URL (`<li key={character.url}>`).

### Summary

- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 6
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 5
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 1

### Conclusion

The implementation is mostly correct, with one minor issue: errors are not logged to the console. This can be easily fixed by adding a `console.error` statement in the catch block of the API call.

```typescript
catch (error) {
  if (!axios.isCancel(error)) {
    setErrorMessage('Error fetching characters');
    console.error('Error fetching characters:', error); // Add this line
  }
}
```

Overall, the code meets the requirements and follows best practices for React and TypeScript.
