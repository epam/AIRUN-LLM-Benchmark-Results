Your task is to create an application on React 18.x that can utilize the SWAPI open API to fetch characters and display them in a list.

When completing the task, ensure to follow the instructions below:
- Use Create React App, TypeScript, and axios.
- Display a loader while loading.
- Do not include any input fields; only load the data initially and display it.
- Optimize the code where possible.
- The generated code should not contain any TODOs.
- Return the codebase without additional comments.

API Description:
GET https://swapi.dev/api/people?search={search}
Response:
{ results: Array<{ name: string, url: string }> }

Okay, I need to create a React app using TypeScript and Axios to fetch and display Star Wars characters from the SWAPI. Let's start by setting up the project with Create React App and TypeScript. The user specified React 18.x, so I'll make sure the dependencies are correct.

First, the main component will fetch data on mount. Since there's no input field, the initial load should fetch all characters. Wait, the API endpoint includes a search parameter, but without an input, maybe we just omit the search query. So the URL would be 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' without the ?search= part. That makes sense because the example response shows results as an array.

Next, I'll need to manage state for the characters, loading status, and any errors. Using useState hooks for characters, isLoading, and errorMessage. The useEffect hook will trigger the data fetching when the component mounts.

Axios will handle the HTTP request. I'll create an async function inside useEffect, but since useEffect doesn't support async directly, I'll define the function inside and call it. Also, to handle potential component unmounting, I'll use a cleanup function with a cancel token from Axios to abort pending requests.

For optimization, maybe use useCallback to memoize the fetch function, but since it's inside useEffect and the dependencies are empty, it should only run once. Wait, the effect has no dependencies, so it runs once on mount. That's correct.

Displaying a loader while loadingâ€”so when isLoading is true, show a loading message. Once data is fetched, display the list. If there's an error, show the error message.

TypeScript interfaces are needed for the API response. The response has a results array where each item has name and url. So I'll define a Character interface with those properties and a ApiResponse interface for the response structure.

Styling-wise, the user didn't specify, but I'll keep it simple with a centered container, list items with some padding, and basic error styling. Maybe add a class for the loading message and error message.

Testing: Since the user mentioned unit testing, but didn't ask for tests, maybe not required here. But the code should be testable.

Putting it all together:

- Create the functional component using FC type.
- State variables for characters, isLoading, error.
- useEffect to fetch data on mount.
- Axios GET request with cancel token.
- Handle loading states and errors.
- Render the list or messages accordingly.

Wait, the API might return a lot of characters, but the problem doesn't mention pagination. So just display all results from the first page. The SWAPI's people endpoint paginates, but without a search query, the default is page 1. So the app will display the first page of characters.

Edge cases: What if there are no results? The SWAPI should always return some, but maybe handle it. However, the user didn't mention that, so perhaps not necessary.

Optimizations: React.memo for the list items? Since the list is simple, maybe not needed. But using a key from the URL, which is unique, is important.

Error handling: Catch any Axios errors and set the error message. Check for cancellation errors to avoid state updates on unmounted components.

Now, code structure:

- App component with state.
- useEffect for fetching.
- Axios call with try/catch.
- Conditional rendering based on loading and error states.
- Styling via App.css.

I'll create the necessary interfaces, use functional components with hooks, and ensure the code is clean without TODOs or comments as specified.

I'll create the React application with TypeScript and Axios integration. Here's the complete codebase:

1. First, install required dependencies:
```bash
npx create-react-app swapi-list --template typescript
cd swapi-list
npm install axios
```

2. Replace the contents of `src/App.tsx` with:

```typescript
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import axios, { CancelTokenSource } from 'axios';
import './App.css';

interface Character {
  name: string;
  url: string;
}

interface ApiResponse {
  results: Character[];
}

function App() {
  const [characters, setCharacters] = useState<Character[]>([]);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  const [errorMessage, setErrorMessage] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    const source = axios.CancelToken.source();
    const fetchCharacters = async (cancelToken: CancelTokenSource) => {
      setIsLoading(true);
      try {
        const { data } = await axios.get<ApiResponse>(
          'https://swapi.dev/api/people/',
          { cancelToken: cancelToken.token }
        );
        setCharacters(data.results);
        setErrorMessage('');
      } catch (error) {
        if (!axios.isCancel(error)) {
          setErrorMessage('Error fetching characters');
        }
      } finally {
        setIsLoading(false);
      }
    };

    fetchCharacters(source);

    return () => source.cancel();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="container">
      <h1>Star Wars Characters</h1>
      {isLoading && <div className="loader">Loading...</div>}
      {errorMessage && <div className="error">{errorMessage}</div>}
      <ul className="character-list">
        {characters.map((character) => (
          <li key={character.url} className="character-item">
            {character.name}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

3. Replace the contents of `src/App.css` with:

```css
.container {
  max-width: 800px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 20px;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

.loader, .error {
  text-align: center;
  padding: 20px;
  font-size: 18px;
}

.error {
  color: #dc3545;
  background-color: #f8d7da;
  border-radius: 4px;
}

.character-list {
  list-style: none;
  padding: 0;
  margin: 20px 0;
}

.character-item {
  padding: 10px 15px;
  margin: 5px 0;
  background-color: #f8f9fa;
  border-radius: 4px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
}

h1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: #2c3e50;
}
```

This implementation:
- Fetches characters from SWAPI on component mount
- Shows loading state during API request
- Handles errors appropriately
- Displays characters in a styled list
- Uses TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Implements request cancellation on component unmount
- Follows best practices for React 18 with proper hooks usage
- Includes optimized CSS for a clean presentation

The code is properly typed, uses functional components with hooks, and includes proper cleanup in the useEffect hook. The styling provides a clean, responsive layout with appropriate visual feedback for different states.
