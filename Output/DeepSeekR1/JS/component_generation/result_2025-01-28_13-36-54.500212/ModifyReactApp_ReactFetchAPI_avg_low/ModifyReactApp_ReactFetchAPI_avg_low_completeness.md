# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that a loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass**: The code sets `loading` to `true` before making the API request and displays a loading indicator when `loading` is `true`.

### Step 2: Verify that the loader does not hide the search input when data is loading.
**Pass**: The search input is always rendered, regardless of the `loading` state.

### Step 3: Validate that a request with an empty search term is sent on the initial render.
**Pass**: On initial render, `isInitialMount.current` is `true`, and `fetchCharacters(searchTerm)` is called with an empty `searchTerm`.

### Step 4: Verify that the search input field is present.
**Pass**: The search input field is present in the JSX with the placeholder "Search characters...".

### Step 5: Ensure that the character search functionality is implemented.
**Pass**: The search functionality is implemented by updating `searchTerm` state on input change and fetching characters based on the `searchTerm`.

### Step 6: Ensure that the API request includes the search term as a query parameter.
**Pass**: The API request includes the `search` parameter in the `params` object.

### Step 7: Validate that the data is loading on initial app load with empty query and then when the search term changes.
**Pass**: Data is fetched on initial load with an empty query and subsequently when the `searchTerm` changes.

### Step 8: Ensure that the debounced fetch function prevents unnecessary API requests.
**Pass**: The `setTimeout` with a 500ms delay ensures debouncing, preventing unnecessary API requests.

### Step 9: Confirm that the character list is updated based on the search results.
**Pass**: The character list is updated by setting the `characters` state with the fetched data.

### Step 10: Validate that the application handles API request errors.
**Pass**: Errors are caught in the `catch` block, and a console error is logged if the error is not due to request cancellation.

### Step 11: Ensure that the user experience remains smooth without backend overloads.
**Pass**: The debouncing mechanism and request cancellation ensure a smooth user experience without overloading the backend.
