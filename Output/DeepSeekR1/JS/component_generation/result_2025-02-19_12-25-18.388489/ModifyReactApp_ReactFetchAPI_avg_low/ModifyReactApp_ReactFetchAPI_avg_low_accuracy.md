# Evaluation Report

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.**
   - **Pass**: All imports (`React`, `useEffect`, `useState`, `axios`) are used in the code.

2. **Ensure the codebase is structured and follows React best practices (state, hooks, effects).**
   - **Pass**: The code is well-structured, using `useState` for state management and `useEffect` for side effects.

3. **Check that a debounced function is used to optimize the search requests.**
   - **Pass**: A debounced function is implemented using `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout`.

4. **Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.**
   - **Pass**: The use of `AbortController` and cleanup functions in `useEffect` helps prevent memory leaks.

5. **Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.**
   - **Pass**: The code uses modern React hooks and TypeScript features.

6. **Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.**
   - **Pass**: The code includes error handling for API requests and logs errors appropriately.

7. **Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.**
   - **Pass**: The input value is managed using React state (`searchTerm`).

8. **Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React virtual DOM.**
   - **Pass**: There is no direct DOM manipulation; all updates are handled through React state and props.

9. **Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React state and props.**
   - **Pass**: The code does not use refs unnecessarily; state and props are used appropriately.

10. **Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.**
    - **Pass**: The code is concise and does not contain duplicate logic.

11. **Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.**
    - **Pass**: The use of debounced search term helps minimize unnecessary re-renders.

12. **Confirm that the useState is used to capture the search input value.**
    - **Pass**: `useState` is used to capture and manage the search input value (`searchTerm`).

13. **Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs.**
    - **Pass**: There are no TODO comments in the code.

14. **Verify the inclusion of TypeScript in the React application.**
    - **Pass**: The code is written in TypeScript, as indicated by the use of type annotations.

15. **Ensure that `axios` is used for making API requests.**
    - **Pass**: `axios` is used for making API requests to the Star Wars API.

16. **Validate that the `useEffect` hooks are used correctly for data loading.**
    - **Pass**: `useEffect` hooks are used correctly to handle data loading and cleanup.
