# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that a loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass**: The code includes a loading state (`loading`) and conditionally renders a loading indicator (`<div>Loading...</div>`) when `loading` is `true`.

### Step 2: Verify that the loader does not hide the search input when data is loading.
**Pass**: The search input (`<input type="text" placeholder="Search characters..." />`) is always rendered regardless of the loading state.

### Step 3: Validate that a request with an empty search term is sent on the initial render.
**Pass**: On initial render, `searchTerm` and `debouncedSearchTerm` are empty strings, triggering a fetch request with an empty search term.

### Step 4: Verify that the search input field is present.
**Pass**: The search input field is present in the JSX (`<input type="text" placeholder="Search characters..." />`).

### Step 5: Ensure that the character search functionality is implemented.
**Pass**: The character search functionality is implemented using the `searchTerm` state and the `axios.get` request with the search term as a query parameter.

### Step 6: Ensure that the API request includes the search term as a query parameter.
**Pass**: The API request includes the search term as a query parameter (`params: { search: debouncedSearchTerm }`).

### Step 7: Validate that the data is loading on initial app load with empty query and then when the search term changes.
**Pass**: The data is fetched on initial load with an empty query and again whenever `debouncedSearchTerm` changes.

### Step 8: Ensure that the debounced fetch function prevents unnecessary API requests.
**Pass**: The use of `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout` in the first `useEffect` hook debounces the search term, preventing unnecessary API requests.

### Step 9: Confirm that the character list is updated based on the search results.
**Pass**: The character list is updated based on the search results and rendered in the `<ul>` element.

### Step 10: Validate that the application handles API request errors.
**Pass**: The application handles API request errors using a `try-catch` block and logs errors to the console.

### Step 11: Ensure that the user experience remains smooth without backend overloads.
**Pass**: The debouncing mechanism and the use of `AbortController` to cancel previous requests ensure a smooth user experience without overloading the backend.
