# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x
  
  The code imports React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` which are compatible with React 18.x. The component is implemented as a functional component using React hooks, which is the modern approach used in React 18.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
  
  The code uses TypeScript with proper type definitions, including:
  - Interface definitions for `SelectOption` and `SearchableSelectProps`
  - Type annotations for state variables, refs, and function parameters
  - Event type annotations (KeyboardEvent)
  - React.FC type annotation for the functional component
  - Proper typing for all hooks and callbacks

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling
  
  The implementation includes a separate index.css file with comprehensive styling for the select component, including styles for the container, input, dropdown list, and dropdown items.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments
  
  The code is well-structured, properly formatted, and does not contain any TODO comments or debugging statements. It demonstrates production-ready quality with proper organization and consistent formatting.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility
  
  The component uses appropriate React state hooks:
  - `useState` for managing dropdown open state (`isOpen`)
  - `useState` for search query
  - `useState` for tracking highlighted index
  - Proper state updates using functional form where needed
  - Uses `useMemo` for derived state (filteredOptions, selectedOption)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props
  
  The component accepts custom props through the `SearchableSelectProps` interface:
  - `options`: Array of selectable options
  - `value`: Currently selected value
  - `onChange`: Callback for selection changes
  - `placeholder`: Optional customizable placeholder text

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection
  
  The component implements comprehensive keyboard navigation through the `handleKeyDown` function:
  - Arrow Up/Down for navigating options
  - Enter for selecting the highlighted option
  - Escape for closing the dropdown
  - The keyboard event handlers are properly memoized with useCallback

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions
  
  The component follows best practices:
  - Uses `useRef` for DOM references (containerRef, inputRef)
  - Properly accesses DOM elements through refs
  - Uses event listeners cleanly with proper cleanup in useEffect
  - Performs focus management through refs

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques
  
  The component manages focus appropriately:
  - Focuses the input when dropdown opens
  - Maintains focus after selection/closing
  - Tracks highlighted options with state
  - Uses aria-activedescendant for accessibility

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
  
  The component includes comprehensive ARIA attributes:
  - `role="combobox"` for the input
  - `aria-autocomplete="list"`
  - `aria-expanded` for dropdown state
  - `aria-controls` linking to the dropdown list
  - `aria-activedescendant` for tracking active option
  - `role="listbox"` for the options container
  - `role="option"` for individual options
  - `aria-selected` for showing selected state

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  There are no console.log, console.error, or other debugging statements in the code that would produce errors or warnings in the browser console.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component
  
  The component uses performance optimization techniques to prevent unnecessary re-renders:
  - `useMemo` for filtered options and selected option
  - `useCallback` for event handlers
  - Proper dependency arrays in hooks
  - State updates only when necessary
  - Efficient event handling
