# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  Although the code does not explicitly state "React 18.x" (e.g., through version-specific features or version numbers), it uses modern React hooks and patterns that are fully compatible with React 18. I am 90% confident it implies React 18 usage based on current best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  The file uses a .tsx extension, TypeScript interfaces, and proper event typings, which confirms that the code is written in TypeScript with precise type definitions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  An index.css file is provided, containing the CSS rules for the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  The code is well-organized, commented for clarity where necessary, and does not include any TODO comments or placeholders that would indicate incomplete sections.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  The component employs useState to manage the dropdown visibility (isOpen) and search query, as well as handles the selection state correctly, demonstrating proper state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  The component accepts props such as options, value, onChange, and placeholder. These props allow it to be reused and customized for different use cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  The provided onKeyDown handler covers Escape, ArrowUp, ArrowDown, and Enter for both opening/closing the dropdown and making selections, fulfilling the keyboard navigation requirements.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  The use of useRef for managing container and input focus, along with useCallback for event handlers, aligns well with React best practices for handling DOM interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  The code actively manages focus by calling inputRef.current?.focus() within various component interactions (e.g., when toggling the dropdown and after closing it), ensuring users have a smooth experience.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  The component applies ARIA roles (combobox, listbox, option) and related properties (e.g., aria-expanded, aria-controls, aria-activedescendant) appropriately to support accessibility.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  There are no apparent issues in the code structure that would trigger console warnings or errors. However, without a runtime environment or testing in a live application, I am 90% confident that the code is free from such issues.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  The use of useMemo to memoize filtered options and selected option, along with useCallback for event handlers, suggests that the component minimizes unnecessary re-renders. I am 95% confident in this assessment as the techniques employed align with React performance best practices.
