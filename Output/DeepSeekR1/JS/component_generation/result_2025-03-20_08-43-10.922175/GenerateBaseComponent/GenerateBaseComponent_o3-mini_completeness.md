# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component renders a container that conditionally displays a <ul> (with class "dropdown-list") as the dropdown when open.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  The component uses an <input> element inside the "select-input" div that acts as both a display and search field. Although the input always appears, its behavior changes (readOnly when closed and editable when open), effectively serving as a search input. The slight ambiguity regarding the input’s location relative to the dropdown (as it is always visible rather than embedded in the dropdown list) gives a 95% confidence level.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The implementation handles selection via both mouse clicks and keyboard interaction, calling the onChange callback with the selected option’s value.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The onKeyDown handler explicitly manages ArrowDown (to increase) and ArrowUp (to decrease) the highlighted index, supporting navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  The onKeyDown function detects the Enter key when the dropdown is open and selects the highlighted option, confirming this functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  When the dropdown is closed, pressing Enter opens it and focuses the input, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  When the Escape key is pressed, the code explicitly calls inputRef.current?.focus() after closing the dropdown. However, for selections (via Enter or mouse click), the focus return is implicitly maintained rather than explicitly set. This behavior is acceptable in most cases but would be slightly more robust if managed uniformly, hence a 90% confidence level.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  The onClick handler on each dropdown list item calls setIsOpen(false) and clears search input, ensuring the dropdown closes on mouse selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  The keyboard Enter key selection flow closes the dropdown by calling setIsOpen(false) after selecting an item.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  The Escape key event case in the onKeyDown handler properly closes the dropdown and refocuses the input.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  A document-level click listener is implemented that checks if the click is outside the component’s container, and if so, closes the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  When not open, the Enter key in the onKeyDown handler sets the dropdown’s open state to true and focuses the input.
