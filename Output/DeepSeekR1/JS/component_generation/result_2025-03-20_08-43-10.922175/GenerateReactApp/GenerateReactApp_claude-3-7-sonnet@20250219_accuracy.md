# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses React 18.x or newer by checking the package.json dependencies
  
  The package.json shows `"react": "^18.2.0"` which confirms React 18.x is being used.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that TypeScript is properly implemented with appropriate type definitions for all components, props, and states
  
  TypeScript is properly implemented with interfaces for `Character` and `SwapiResponse`, and proper typing for state variables (`useState<Character[]>`, `useState<string | null>`).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Axios is used for API requests to fetch data from the Star Wars API endpoint
  
  Axios is properly imported and used for the API request with `axios.get<SwapiResponse>('https://swapi.dev/api/people')`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles API errors gracefully with appropriate error states or messages
  
  Error handling is implemented with try/catch block, setting error state, and displaying an error message to the user when an error occurs.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the character data is fetched on component mount using useEffect hook
  
  The `useEffect` hook is correctly used to fetch data on component mount with the `fetchCharacters` function as a dependency.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application properly manages component rendering optimization
  
  Rendering optimization is implemented using `useCallback` for the fetch function and proper dependency array in `useEffect`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows React best practices using hooks appropriately
  
  The code uses React hooks appropriately (useState, useEffect, useCallback) and follows best practices like conditional rendering based on state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't contain any TODO comments or unnecessary code
  
  The code is clean without any TODO comments or unnecessary code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the codebase has minimal comments that only clarify complex logic when necessary
  
  The code doesn't contain unnecessary comments and is self-explanatory.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the API endpoint 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' is being called correctly
  
  The API endpoint is called correctly using Axios in the fetchCharacters function.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application renders without console errors or warnings
  
  Based on the implementation, there are no obvious issues that would cause console errors or warnings. The code properly handles loading states, error states, and implements proper key usage in the list rendering.
