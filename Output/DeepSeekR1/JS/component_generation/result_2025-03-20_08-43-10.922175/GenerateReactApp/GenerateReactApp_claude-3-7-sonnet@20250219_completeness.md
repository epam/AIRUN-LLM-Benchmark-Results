# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The code properly fetches Star Wars characters from the SWAPI API using axios and displays them in a list. The data fetching is implemented in the `fetchCharacters` function which makes a GET request to 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' and sets the characters state with the response data.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The application correctly implements a loading state. It sets `isLoading` to true initially, then to false when the API call completes. While loading, it renders a div with "Loading characters..." text as shown in the conditional rendering: `if (isLoading) { return <div className="loading">Loading characters...</div>; }`

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The application maps over all characters in the response and displays each one in a list item: `{characters.map((character) => (<li key={character.url} className="character-item">{character.name}</li>))}`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  The code doesn't contain any search functionality or user input fields. It's a simple list display without any filtering or search capabilities.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character is displayed with its name in a list item element: `<li key={character.url} className="character-item">{character.name}</li>`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The solution begins with instructions to create the application using Create React App with TypeScript: `npx create-react-app swapi-character-list --template typescript`

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The application has proper state management:
  - `const [characters, setCharacters] = useState<Character[]>([]);` for character data
  - `const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);` for loading state
  - `const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);` for error state

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each character list item has a unique key derived from the character URL: `<li key={character.url} className="character-item">`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  If the API returns an empty array of characters, the map function would simply not render any items but the list structure would still be displayed correctly. The application also handles loading and error states appropriately with dedicated UI components.
