# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The provided code calls the SWAPI (https://swapi.dev/api/people) and renders the character names from the fetched results.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The component conditionally renders a div with the message "Loading characters..." when isLoading is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  The code maps over the characters array (populated from the API call) and displays each character’s name in a list element.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  The implementation does not include any search bars or input elements; it purely fetches and displays the data.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each list item renders the character's name using {character.name} while using the unique URL as a key.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The instructions include using "npx create-react-app swapi-character-list --template typescript", confirming the use of Create React App.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The code uses useState for managing loading, error, and the characters’ data, ensuring proper state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  The key for each list item is set to the character's URL, ensuring uniquely identifiable keys for React’s list rendering.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  Although the code does not explicitly render a message when no characters are returned, it gracefully displays an empty list. This is acceptable behavior; however, a dedicated empty state message could improve user feedback. The evaluation is marked with a slightly lower confidence (95%) to acknowledge this minor potential improvement.
