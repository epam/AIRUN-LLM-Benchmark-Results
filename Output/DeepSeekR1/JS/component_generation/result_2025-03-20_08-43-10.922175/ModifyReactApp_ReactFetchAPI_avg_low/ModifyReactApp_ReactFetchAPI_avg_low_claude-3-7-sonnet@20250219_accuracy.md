# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type
  
  The code correctly implements state update for the search field with `onChange` event handler:
  ```tsx
  onChange={(e) => setSearchTerm(e.target.value)}
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls
  
  The code implements a custom `useDebounce` hook with a 500ms delay:
  ```tsx
  const debouncedSearchTerm = useDebounce(searchTerm, 500);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured
  
  Axios is correctly imported and used for API requests with proper configuration including cancel tokens and parameters:
  ```tsx
  const response = await axios.get<SWAPIResponse>('https://swapi.dev/api/people/', {
    params: { search },
    cancelToken: cancelToken.token,
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses
  
  TypeScript interfaces are properly defined for Character, SWAPIResponse, and the component is typed as React.FC.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters
  
  The API endpoint is correctly constructed with search parameters:
  ```tsx
  const response = await axios.get<SWAPIResponse>('https://swapi.dev/api/people/', {
    params: { search },
    cancelToken: cancelToken.token,
  });
  ```

- **Fail** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate
  
  The code does not implement `useMemo` or `useCallback` for functions like the fetch function that could benefit from memoization to prevent unnecessary recreations on each render.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback
  
  Error handling is properly implemented with try/catch blocks, error state management, and user feedback:
  ```tsx
  catch (error) {
    if (!axios.isCancel(error)) {
      setError('Failed to fetch characters. Please try again later.');
      console.error('API Error:', error);
    }
  }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing
  
  API calls are triggered by changes to `debouncedSearchTerm`, which only updates after the debounce delay:
  ```tsx
  useEffect(() => {
    // API call logic
  }, [debouncedSearchTerm]);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices
  
  The code follows React best practices with separate state variables for different concerns (characters, loading, searchTerm, error) and proper state updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code
  
  The code appears clean without commented-out code or unused imports. The only console statement is for error logging which is appropriate.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests
  
  Loading state is properly managed with setLoading(true) at the beginning of fetch and setLoading(false) after completion in the finally block.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns
  
  The component uses functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect) which aligns with React 18.x patterns. No deprecated patterns are used.
