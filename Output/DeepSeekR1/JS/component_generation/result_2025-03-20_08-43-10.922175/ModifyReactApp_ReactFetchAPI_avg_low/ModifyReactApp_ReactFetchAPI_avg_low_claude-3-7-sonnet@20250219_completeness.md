# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name
  
  The code includes a clearly defined search input field with appropriate placeholder text, styling, and functionality to filter characters by name:
  ```tsx
  <input
    type="text"
    placeholder="Search Star Wars characters..."
    value={searchTerm}
    onChange={(e) => setSearchTerm(e.target.value)}
    style={{...}}
  />
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests
  
  The code includes a loading indicator that displays during API requests:
  ```tsx
  {loading && <div style={{ padding: '12px', textAlign: 'center' }}>Loading characters...</div>}
  ```
  The loading state is properly set to true during fetch operations and false when they complete.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query
  
  The component uses a useEffect hook that triggers when the component mounts and when the debounced search term changes. The initial state of searchTerm is an empty string, ensuring that all characters will be loaded when the component first mounts:
  ```tsx
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
  // ...
  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch logic here
  }, [debouncedSearchTerm]);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type
  
  The code implements a debounce mechanism that waits for the user to stop typing before making API requests, and updates the character list when new results are received:
  ```tsx
  const debouncedSearchTerm = useDebounce(searchTerm, 500);
  // ...
  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch logic that gets called when debouncedSearchTerm changes
  }, [debouncedSearchTerm]);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found
  
  The code includes specific UI feedback when searches return no results:
  ```tsx
  {!loading && !error && characters.length === 0 && (
    <div style={{ padding: '12px', textAlign: 'center' }}>No characters found matching your search.</div>
  )}
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design
  
  The component includes responsive design elements with appropriate styling:
  ```tsx
  <div style={{ maxWidth: '600px', margin: '0 auto', padding: '20px' }}>
  ```
  The input field has width: '100%' which adapts to the container size, making it responsive.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response
  
  After the API response is received, the characters state is updated with the results, and the component renders the list of characters:
  ```tsx
  {!loading && !error && characters.length > 0 && (
    <ul style={{ listStyle: 'none', padding: 0, margin: 0 }}>
      {characters.map((character) => (
        <li key={character.url} style={{...}}>
          {character.name}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )}
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed
  
  The code implements error handling within the API request logic and displays error messages to the user:
  ```tsx
  try {
    // Fetch logic
  } catch (error) {
    if (!axios.isCancel(error)) {
      setError('Failed to fetch characters. Please try again later.');
      console.error('API Error:', error);
    }
  }
  ```
  ```tsx
  {error && (
    <div style={{ color: '#dc3545', padding: '12px', border: '1px solid #dc3545', borderRadius: '4px', marginBottom: '20px' }}>
      {error}
    </div>
  )}
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props
  
  The code defines TypeScript interfaces
