# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The code includes an input element with type "text", a placeholder "Search Star Wars characters...", and the value is controlled by state (searchTerm). This confirms that the search field is present and set to filter characters by name.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  The code uses a "loading" state, rendering a div with "Loading characters..." when loading is true. This clearly indicates the search operation displays a loading message during API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  The component initializes searchTerm as an empty string; then debouncedSearchTerm remains empty initially, triggering the useEffect call to fetch characters from SWAPI. This confirms correct fetching of initial data.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  The combination of setting searchTerm on input change and utilizing a debounced value ensures that API calls are triggered dynamically as the user types. The component properly updates the character results dynamically.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  The code conditionally shows a message ("No characters found matching your search.") when the API response returns an empty characters array, providing clear feedback to the user.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The container div includes inline styling with a max-width of 600px, centered margins, and padding, which contributes to a basic responsive layout. Although the approach is simple, it meets the requirement.  
  Explanation: More advanced responsive design might involve media queries or styled components, yet the current implementation provides basic responsiveness.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  The code maps over the fetched characters array and renders a list item for each character. This ensures that search results are displayed when data is available.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  The asynchronous API call is wrapped in a try-catch block. Errors are logged and displayed via the error state, thus providing the necessary error handling.  
  Explanation: While the component does not use a dedicated React Error Boundary component (which would catch rendering errors), the API error handling logic is appropriately implemented for its purpose.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The code defines TypeScript interfaces for the API response (SWAPIResponse) and each character (Character). The component itself is typed as React.FC. All necessary types for API data are present.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The solution integrates search functionality with debouncing and request cancellation without removing the original data fetching and rendering features. The component continues to load data initially and update dynamically as the search term changes.
