### Evaluation Report

#### Pass: Confirm that constraints related to local storage limitations are noted.
- The report mentions that `localStorage` has size limits (~5MB) and a synchronous API that blocks the main thread.

#### Fail: Verify that assumptions about the application being designed for a single user are mentioned.
- The report does not explicitly mention that the application is designed for a single user.

#### Pass: Ensure that browser compatibility assumptions are included.
- The report notes that the application relies on `localStorage`, which is unsupported in environments like SSR (Server-Side Rendering).

#### Pass: Check that performance-related constraints are noted.
- The report discusses performance constraints, such as the lack of pagination/virtualization and the synchronous nature of `localStorage`.

#### Pass: Confirm that performance optimizations, such as the use of `shouldComponentUpdate`, are identified.
- The report identifies the use of `shouldComponentUpdate` in `TodoItem` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

#### Pass: Verify that considerations for using immutable data structures for performance are mentioned.
- The report mentions the use of immutable operations (e.g., `map`, `filter`) in `TodoModel` to ensure predictable state changes.

#### Pass: Ensure scalability considerations related to local storage limitations are discussed.
- The report discusses the size limits of `localStorage` and its synchronous API as scalability constraints.

#### Fail: Check that the potential need for a backend service for better scalability is mentioned.
- The report does not mention the potential need for a backend service for better scalability.

#### Pass: Confirm that the evaluation steps are unambiguous and concise.
- The evaluation steps are clear and concise.

#### Pass: Ensure that each step allows the evaluator to assess the output based solely on the provided code.
- Each step allows the evaluator to assess the output based on the provided code and report.

#### Pass: Verify that the steps are clearly articulated and cover all main points of the task.
- The steps are clearly articulated and cover the main points of the task.
