# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Confirm that constraints related to local storage limitations are noted.**
   - **Pass**: The document mentions that localStorage is suitable for small-scale data and that browser storage limits apply.

2. **Verify that assumptions about the application being designed for a single user are mentioned.**
   - **Pass**: The document clearly states that the application has no multi-user/auth support and that data is device-specific.

3. **Ensure that browser compatibility assumptions are included.**
   - **Pass**: The document notes that the application relies on localStorage and modern JavaScript, with no fallback for older browsers.

4. **Check that performance-related constraints are noted.**
   - **Pass**: The document discusses synchronous operations potentially blocking the main thread for large datasets and mentions the lack of pagination or lazy loading.

5. **Confirm that performance optimizations, such as the use of `shouldComponentUpdate`, are identified.**
   - **Pass**: The document highlights the use of `shouldComponentUpdate` in `TodoItem` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

6. **Verify that considerations for using immutable data structures for performance are mentioned.**
   - **Pass**: The document mentions the use of immutable operations like `concat` and `map` for efficient state updates.

7. **Ensure scalability considerations related to local storage limitations are discussed.**
   - **Pass**: The document discusses the limitations of localStorage for large datasets and the potential performance issues.

8. **Check that the potential need for a backend service for better scalability is mentioned.**
   - **Pass**: The document recommends adding sync with a REST/GraphQL API for cross-device access in future iterations.

9. **Confirm that the evaluation steps are unambiguous and concise.**
   - **Pass**: The evaluation steps are clear and concise, allowing for straightforward assessment.

10. **Ensure that each step allows the evaluator to assess the output based solely on the provided code.**
    - **Pass**: Each step is designed to be assessed based on the provided document, without requiring additional context.

11. **Verify that the steps are clearly articulated and cover all main points of the task.**
    - **Pass**: The steps are well-articulated and cover all the main points of the task, including constraints, assumptions, performance, and scalability.
