# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document identifies the application as a Todo list management application  
  The answer clearly describes the core features as a "Todo management system with CRUD operations" and specifies todo-related functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the component structure (TodoApp, TodoItem, TodoFooter)  
  The component hierarchy is explicitly detailed with TodoApp as the root, TodoItem for individual items, and TodoFooter for controls.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of local storage for data persistence  
  The answer mentions "Persistent storage using localStorage" and details its implementation via `Utils.store`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the state management approach using the TodoModel  
  The state is described as managed via React component state and the TodoModel, with clear explanations in both the "Data Flow" and "State Management" sections.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the routing mechanism for filtering todos  
  The provided text explains filtering by statuses and notes the architectural decision of using "Manual routing instead of React Router" for the filtering functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the event handling for user interactions  
  The answer details key user journeys and interaction patterns such as adding, toggling, editing, and filtering todos, including keyboard shortcuts and instant feedback.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of immutable data structures for state management  
  Although the document mentions the use of efficient array operations (map/filter vs mutation), it does not explicitly indicate or discuss the use of immutable data structures for state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the performance optimization using shouldComponentUpdate  
  The answer clearly indicates that performance optimizations are achieved with selective re-rendering through shouldComponentUpdate in TodoItem.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of the Utils class for helper functions  
  The answer mentions both `Utils.store` for localStorage interactions and `Utils.uuid` for UUID generation, clearly identifying the role of the Utils class.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the data flow between components  
  The answer describes a unidirectional data flow from TodoModel to TodoApp and its child components, effectively detailing the interaction between components.
