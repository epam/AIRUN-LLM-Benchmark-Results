# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers all main functionality including adding, editing, deleting, and toggling todos  
  The answer outlines a todo management system with CRUD operations, mentions adding new todos, inline editing, and toggling of statuses. Although deletion is not explicitly described as a separate “delete” action, the mention of CRUD and the "clear completed" functionality implies deletion is covered.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about filtering todos by status (all, active, completed)  
  The answer explicitly mentions filtering operations by all/active/completed statuses and provides details on the filtering controls in the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the user workflow for creating new todo items  
  It includes a clear user journey starting with "Add new todo via header input" which maps directly to the creation workflow.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the editing functionality triggered by double-clicking  
  The answer fully addresses editing by noting that todos can be edited via a double-click on the item.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the clear completed functionality  
  The functionality to "clear completed" items is directly mentioned among the bulk actions provided by the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the toggle all functionality  
  The answer references bulk actions, including a "mark all complete" action, which covers the toggle all functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the counter for remaining items  
  The discussion includes a mention of a memoized derived counter “activeTodoCount”, indicating that the remaining items are tracked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the persistent storage of todos  
  Persistent storage is discussed in depth, citing localStorage use and the Utils.store abstraction.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the UI components and their relationships  
  The component hierarchy with TodoApp (root), TodoItem, and TodoFooter is clearly detailed along with the data flow and interaction patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the business objectives addressed by the application  
  The answer contains a dedicated section outlining primary and secondary business objectives, including reliability and user experience.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes performance and scalability considerations  
  There is detailed commentary on performance optimization (e.g., shouldComponentUpdate) and scalability concerns linked to localStorage limits.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes technical constraints and limitations  
  Technical constraints and assumptions are well covered, including client-only storage limitations and architectural decisions like using class-based components.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the document covers the pluralization of item/items text based on count  
  There is no explicit mention of the UI handling pluralization (e.g., “item” vs “items”) based on the todo count. While the counter is discussed via "activeTodoCount," the specific UI text behavior regarding pluralization is missing.
