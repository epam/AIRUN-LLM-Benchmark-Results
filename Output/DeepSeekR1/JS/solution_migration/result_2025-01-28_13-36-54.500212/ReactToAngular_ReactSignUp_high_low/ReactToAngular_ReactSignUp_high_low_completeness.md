# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Verify that all React components and their functionalities are correctly translated into Angular components.
- **Pass**: The provided code includes Angular components (`SignupComponent`, `FormControlComponent`) that replicate the functionalities of the React components.

### Step 2: Ensure that the form validation logic is implemented using Angular reactive forms.
- **Pass**: The form validation logic is implemented using Angular reactive forms (`FormBuilder`, `FormGroup`, `Validators`, `AsyncValidatorFn`).

### Step 3: Check that the application includes the necessary form controls and validation rules.
- **Pass**: The application includes form controls for `name`, `email`, and `password` with appropriate validation rules (e.g., required, minlength, maxlength, custom email validator).

### Step 4: Confirm that the application correctly binds the form controls and handles form submission.
- **Pass**: The form controls are correctly bound using `formControlName` and the form submission is handled by the `onSubmit` method in `SignupComponent`.

### Step 5: Ensure the application correctly displays form validation errors.
- **Pass**: The `FormControlComponent` is used to display validation errors, and the `errorMessage` getter provides appropriate error messages based on the validation errors.

### Step 6: Verify that the application contains actions for signup, signup success, and signup failure.
- **Pass**: The `signupComplete` action is dispatched on successful signup. The error handling in the `onSubmit` method sets form errors on failure.

### Step 7: Ensure that the auth.effects.ts file correctly handles side effects using @ngrx/effects, including calling the API and dispatching success or failure actions.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include the `auth.effects.ts` file, so it cannot be verified if side effects are handled using `@ngrx/effects`.

### Step 8: Validate that the API call to signup is correctly integrated and that the response is handled properly.
- **Pass**: The `AuthService` includes the `signup` method which makes an API call to `/api/signup`. The response is handled in the `onSubmit` method of `SignupComponent`.

### Step 9: Confirm that the application navigates to the login page correctly when the link is clicked.
- **Pass**: The `routerLink` directive in the template correctly navigates to the login page when the link is clicked.
