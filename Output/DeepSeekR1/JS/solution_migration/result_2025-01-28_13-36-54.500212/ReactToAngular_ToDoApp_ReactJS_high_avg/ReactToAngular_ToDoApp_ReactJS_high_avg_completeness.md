# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Check that the main component displays the header with input for new todos.
- **Pass**: The `AppComponent` template includes a header with an input field for new todos.

### Step 2: Ensure that adding a new todo item works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `handleNewTodoKeyDown` method in `AppComponent` dispatches the `addTodo` action, which is handled in the `todoReducer` to add a new todo item.

### Step 3: Verify that the todo list displays all added todo items.
- **Pass**: The `AppComponent` template uses `*ngFor` to iterate over `filteredTodos$` and display each todo item using the `app-todo-item` component.

### Step 4: Confirm that toggle functionality works for marking todos as completed.
- **Pass**: The `toggle` method in `AppComponent` dispatches the `toggle` action, which is handled in the `todoReducer` to toggle the completed state of a todo item.

### Step 5: Check that editing a todo item works and updates the todo item correctly.
- **Pass**: The `edit` method in `AppComponent` dispatches the `setEditing` action, and the `save` method dispatches the `save` action, both of which are handled in the `todoReducer`.

### Step 6: Ensure that deleting a todo item removes it from the list.
- **Pass**: The `destroy` method in `AppComponent` dispatches the `destroy` action, which is handled in the `todoReducer` to remove the todo item.

### Step 7: Verify that the footer correctly displays the count of active items.
- **Pass**: The `AppComponent` template includes the `app-todo-footer` component, which receives `activeTodoCount$` as an input and displays the count.

### Step 8: Confirm that the footer's clear completed button works and removes completed items.
- **Pass**: The `clearCompleted` method in `AppComponent` dispatches the `clearCompleted` action, which is handled in the `todoReducer` to remove completed items.

### Step 9: Check that filtering todos by "all", "active", and "completed" works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `setFilter` action is dispatched in `ngOnInit` of `AppComponent` and handled in the `todoReducer` to filter todos based on the selected filter.

### Step 10: Ensure that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `toggleAll` method in `AppComponent` dispatches the `toggleAll` action, which is handled in the `todoReducer` to mark all todos as complete or incomplete.

### Step 11: Check that the application persists todos to local storage and reloads them correctly.
- **Fail**: The `TodoEffects` class attempts to persist todos to local storage, but the `tap` operator does not have access to the current state to retrieve the todos. The `Utils.store` method is called with `action.todos`, which does not exist in the action payload.

## Summary

- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 11
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 10
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 1

Overall, the application meets most of the requirements, but there is an issue with persisting todos to local storage. The `TodoEffects` class needs to be updated to correctly access the current state and persist the todos.
