# Evaluation Report

## Step-by-Step Evaluation

### Step 1: Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.
- **Pass**: All imports in the provided code are used.

### Step 2: Ensure the codebase is structured and follows Angular style guidelines and best practices.
- **Pass**: The codebase is well-structured, with components, directives, and state management separated appropriately.

### Step 3: Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of Angular and TypeScript.
- **Pass**: The code appears to be compatible with Angular 14.x and TypeScript, as it uses modern Angular features and syntax.

### Step 4: Verify the application works correctly across modern browsers.
- **Not Evaluated**: This step requires running the application in different browsers, which is not possible in this static code review.

### Step 5: Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.
- **Not Evaluated**: This step requires running the application and checking the console, which is not possible in this static code review.

### Step 6: Ensure the code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility.
- **Pass**: The code is decomposed into multiple components, each handling a specific part of the application.

### Step 7: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
- **Pass**: The code does not contain any obvious duplicates and follows DRY principles.

### Step 8: Check that @ngrx/store is used for state management.
- **Pass**: @ngrx/store is used for state management.

### Step 9: Check that @ngrx/effects is used for handling side effects.
- **Pass**: @ngrx/effects is used for handling side effects.

### Step 10: Confirm that the code is split into separate components.
- **Pass**: The code is split into separate components.

### Step 11: Ensure that localStorage is used for persisting todos via a service.
- **Fail**: localStorage is used directly in the effects file instead of via a service.

### Step 12: Check that state management actions and reducers are correctly implemented.
- **Pass**: State management actions and reducers are correctly implemented.

### Step 13: Verify that effects are correctly implemented to handle side effects.
- **Pass**: Effects are correctly implemented to handle side effects.

### Step 14: Ensure that the converted code does not contain any TODOs.
- **Pass**: The code does not contain any TODOs.

### Step 15: Verify that all AngularJS-specific elements and syntax are removed.
- **Pass**: The code does not contain any AngularJS-specific elements or syntax.

### Step 16: Confirm that the application structure adheres to Angular style guidelines.
- **Pass**: The application structure adheres to Angular style guidelines.

### Step 17: Verify App does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.
- **Pass**: The application uses Angular's two-way data binding to retrieve the values of text fields.

### Step 18: Verify App does not make API calls.
- **Pass**: The application does not make any API calls.

### Step 19: Verify App has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.
- **Not Evaluated**: This step requires comparing the DOM tree structure and classes with the original application, which is not possible in this static code review.

### Step 20: Verify that the code is migrated to Angular 14.x.
- **Pass**: The code appears to be compatible with Angular 14.x.
