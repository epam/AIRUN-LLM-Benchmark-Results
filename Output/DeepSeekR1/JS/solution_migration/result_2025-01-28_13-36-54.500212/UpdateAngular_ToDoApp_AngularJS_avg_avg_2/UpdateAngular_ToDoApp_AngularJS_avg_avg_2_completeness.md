# Evaluation Report

## Step-by-Step Evaluation

### Step 1: Confirm that the application initializes correctly and loads persisted todos.
- **Pass**: The `ngOnInit` method in `AppComponent` dispatches the `loadTodos` action, and the `TodoEffects` class handles loading todos from local storage.

### Step 2: Ensure that the todo list displays correctly and is interactive.
- **Pass**: The `AppComponent` template correctly uses the `app-todo-list` component to display the list of todos. The `TodoListComponent` handles the display and interaction of the todo items.

### Step 3: Verify that adding a new todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `onAddTodo` method in `AppComponent` dispatches the `addTodo` action, and the `todoReducer` handles adding the new todo to the state.

### Step 4: Check that editing a todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `onEditTodo` method in `AppComponent` dispatches the `updateTodo` action, and the `todoReducer` handles updating the todo in the state. The `TodoItemComponent` handles the UI for editing a todo.

### Step 5: Confirm that toggling a todo item completion status works correctly.
- **Fail**: The `onToggleTodo` method in `AppComponent` dispatches the `updateTodo` action, but the `changes` object incorrectly references `this.todos` instead of the specific todo's completion status.

### Step 6: Ensure that removing a todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `onRemoveTodo` method in `AppComponent` dispatches the `removeTodo` action, and the `todoReducer` handles removing the todo from the state.

### Step 7: Verify that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works.
- **Pass**: The `onMarkAll` method in `AppComponent` dispatches the `markAll` action, and the `todoReducer` handles updating the completion status of all todos.

### Step 8: Check that the filter functionality (All, Active, Completed) works.
- **Fail**: The `selectFilteredTodos` selector in `todo.selectors.ts` does not correctly handle the `props` parameter, which is necessary for filtering todos based on the selected filter.

### Step 9: Confirm that the "Clear completed" button works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `onClearCompleted` method in `AppComponent` dispatches the `clearCompleted` action, and the `todoReducer` handles removing completed todos from the state.

### Step 10: Ensure that the application is responsive and functions correctly on different screen sizes.
- **Pass**: The application uses standard Angular components and CSS classes, which should ensure responsiveness. However, a detailed CSS review is not included in the provided code.
