- **Pass**: The application contains a button container with "Notes" and "Letters" buttons within the `btn-container` div.

### Step 2: Verify the application renders piano keys for both natural and sharp notes.
- **Pass**: The application renders piano keys for both natural and sharp notes using the `whiteKeys` and `sharpKeys` arrays.

### Step 3: Verify clicking on a piano key plays the correct sound and highlights the key.
- **Pass**: Clicking on a piano key triggers the `playNote` function, which plays the correct sound and highlights the key by adding the `piano-key-active` class.

### Step 4: Verify releasing the mouse button or moving the cursor out of the key stops the sound and removes the highlight.
- **Pass**: Releasing the mouse button or moving the cursor out of the key triggers the `resetNote` function, which stops the sound and removes the highlight by removing the `piano-key-active` class.

### Step 5: Verify pressing and releasing keyboard keys play and stop the corresponding piano notes.
- **Pass**: Pressing and releasing keyboard keys trigger the `handleKeyInteraction` function, which calls `playNote` and `resetNote` functions to play and stop the corresponding piano notes.

### Step 6: Verify clicking the "Notes" button displays note names on the keys.
