# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Confirm that the state slices for page and user are correctly defined and managed.
- **Pass**: The `pageSlice` and `userSlice` are correctly defined using `createSlice` from `@reduxjs/toolkit`. The initial states and reducers are properly set up.

### Step 2: Verify that API service functions are correctly defined and used.
- **Pass**: The API service functions in `api/client.ts` are correctly defined using `axios.create`. The functions for `contentAPI`, `contentTagsAPI`, and `contentExtrasAPI` cover the necessary CRUD operations.

### Step 3: Ensure that the application correctly handles all the functionalities from the original Angular code.
- **Pass**: The application appears to handle the functionalities such as setting page details, updating page type, and managing tags. The `PageEditor` and `PublishControls` components are designed to handle these functionalities.

### Step 4: Verify that all functionalities like save, delete, update, and tag management are working correctly.
- **Pass**: The `PageContainer` component handles the save and duplicate functionalities correctly. The `handleSave` function manages the creation and updating of pages, including setting the author and published date.

### Step 5: Ensure that the application performs all CRUD operations correctly.
- **Pass**: The CRUD operations are covered by the API service functions and the `PageContainer` component. The `contentAPI` functions are used to get, create, update, and delete content.

### Step 6: Verify that the application handles local storage and state persistence correctly.
- **Fail**: There is no explicit handling of local storage or state persistence in the provided code. This step is not addressed in the current implementation.

## Summary
- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 6
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 5
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 1

Overall, the migrated React code is well-structured and covers most of the required functionalities. However, it lacks explicit handling of local storage and state persistence.
