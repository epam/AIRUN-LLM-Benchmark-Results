### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.**
   - **Pass**: All imports are used in the code.

2. **Ensure the codebase is structured and follows React best practices (state, hooks, effects).**
   - **Pass**: The codebase follows React best practices, using state, hooks, and effects appropriately.

3. **Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.**
   - **Pass**: The use of `React.memo` in `TodoItem` and `TodoFooter` helps prevent unnecessary re-renders.

4. **Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.**
   - **Pass**: The application uses React 18.2.0 and TypeScript 5.1.6, which are the latest versions.

5. **Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.**
   - **Pass**: There are no apparent console errors or warnings in the provided code.

6. **Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.**
   - **Pass**: The app uses React state to manage text field values.

7. **Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React virtual DOM.**
   - **Pass**: The app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React's virtual DOM.

8. **Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React state and props.**
   - **Pass**: Refs are used appropriately, mainly for focusing input fields.

9. **Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.**
   - **Pass**: The use of `React.memo` and proper state management minimizes unnecessary re-renders.

10. **Ensure the code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility.**
    - **Pass**: The code is well-decomposed into components, each with a single responsibility.

11. **Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.**
    - **Pass**: The code follows DRY principles and does not contain duplicates.

12. **Verify app does not make API calls.**
    - **Pass**: The app does not make any API calls.

13. **Verify that the codebase does not contain any TODOs.**
    - **Pass**: There are no TODO comments in the codebase.

14. **Verify app does clean up timers, subscriptions, or event listeners in `useEffect`.**
    - **Pass**: The provided code does not use timers, subscriptions, or event listeners that require cleanup.

15. **App has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.**
    - **Pass**: The DOM structure and classes appear consistent with a typical TODO application.

16. **Ensure that the code is split into separate components.**
    - **Pass**: The code is split into separate components like `App`, `TodoItem`, and `TodoFooter`.

17. **Verify that the codebase is written in TypeScript.**
    - **Pass**: The codebase is written in TypeScript.

18. **Ensure that TypeScript types are correctly defined and used throughout the code.**
    - **Pass**: TypeScript types are correctly defined and used.

19. **Confirm that the codebase does not contain any syntax errors.**
    - **Pass**: There are no syntax errors in the codebase.

20. **Ensure that the `package.json` file is present.**
    - **Pass**: The `package.json` file is present.

21. **Verify the presence of a store configuration file.**
    - **Pass**: The `store.ts` file is present.

22. **Confirm that the store configuration file uses Redux Toolkit.**
    - **Pass**: The store configuration uses Redux Toolkit.

23. **Verify that the application uses `createSlice` from Redux Toolkit to define actions and reducers for adding, toggling one and all, editing, deleting, clearing completed, and filtering TODO items.**
    - **Pass**: The application uses `createSlice` to define actions and reducers.

24. **Confirm the use of `nanoid` for generating unique IDs.**
    - **Pass**: The application uses `nanoid` for generating unique IDs.

25. **Check that the code includes a `Provider` wrapping the entire application.**
    - **Pass**: The `Provider` wraps the entire application.

26. **Confirm that the `Provider` is supplied with the store.**
    - **Pass**: The `Provider` is supplied with the store.
