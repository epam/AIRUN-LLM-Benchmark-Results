# Evaluation Report

## Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
**Pass**: The `Header` component contains an input field with the class `new-todo`. The `handleSubmit` function listens for the Enter key press and dispatches the `addTodo` action with the trimmed text value from the state.

## Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
**Pass**: The `Main` component uses the `filter` prop to determine which todos to display. It uses selectors `selectTodos`, `selectActiveTodos`, and `selectCompletedTodos` to filter the todos accordingly.

## Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
**Pass**: The `Main` component includes a checkbox with the class `toggle-all`. The `onChange` event of this checkbox dispatches the `toggleAll` action to toggle the completion status of all todos.

## Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
**Pass**: The `TodoItem` component includes functionality to toggle (`toggleTodo`), edit (`editTodo`), and delete (`deleteTodo`) each todo item. The corresponding actions are dispatched appropriately.

## Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
**Pass**: The `TodoItem` component handles editing with a double click on the label. The `handleKeyUp` function listens for the Enter key to submit the edit and the Escape key to reset the edit text to the initial value.

## Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
**Pass**: The `Footer` component displays the count of active items using the `activeTodos` selector. It includes filter links for "All", "Active", and "Completed" todos. It also includes a button to clear completed items, which dispatches the `clearCompleted` action.

## Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
**Pass**: The `Footer` component includes a button with the class `clear-completed`. This button dispatches the `clearCompleted` action when clicked.
