# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components
  
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately
  
- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation
  
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization
  
- **Fail** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization
  
  The provided code does not demonstrate any implementation of code splitting for performance optimization. There are no examples of lazy loading components or dynamic imports using React.lazy() or import() functions.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations
  
  The code does not show any usage of React.memo for component memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders of expensive components.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks
  
  The code shows proper dependency arrays in the provided hooks like useEffect in useLocalStorageSync.ts. However, I cannot verify all instances of useEffect throughout the entire codebase, which is why my confidence is not 100%.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models
  
- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks
