# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented
  
  The code shows implementation for updating a page with the `updatePage` reducer action and saving content with the `useSaveContentMutation` hook. The `handleSave` function in PageEditor.tsx appears to handle saving functionality. However, I'm not 100% confident because explicit delete and duplicate functions aren't clearly visible in the snippets provided, though the `handleSave` function has a `duplicate` parameter which suggests duplicate functionality exists.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present
  
  The Page interface includes a `type` field, and the store initializes it. The ContentPayload also contains a `type` field for API requests. However, I don't see explicit UI components for type selection in the snippets, though the structure suggests it would be implemented similarly to other fields.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists
  
  This is clearly implemented in the `usePageForm` hook, which includes logic to generate a URL from the title by converting it to lowercase, replacing spaces with hyphens, and removing non-word characters.

- **Fail** (90%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented
  
  While the Page interface includes a `tags` array and there's a `suggestions` array with a `setSuggestions` action, I don't see specific autocomplete UI components or logic for tag management in the provided code snippets.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available
  
  The Page interface clearly defines a `publish` field with the type `'Y' | 'N' | 'schedule'`, which corresponds to publish, draft, and schedule options respectively.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented
  
  The Page interface includes a `scheduleDate` field of type Date, and the initial state sets it to a new Date object, indicating that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present
  
  The `useLocalStorageSync` hook explicitly handles storing page data in localStorage and provides a `restoreLocalVersion` function to restore data from localStorage.

- **Fail** (80%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented
  
  The code handles errors in the `handleSave` function with `console.error`, but I don't see explicit UI notification components or toast messages for success/error feedback to users.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present
  
  The `validateForm` function in the `usePageForm` hook specifically checks if URL is missing or set to 'new' and returns an error message if so, demonstrating form validation for required fields.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled
  
  The code includes RTK Query API service with endpoints for getting and saving content. The comment "Add other endpoints similarly" suggests more endpoints would be added. Without seeing the original code's endpoints, I can't be 100% certain all are covered.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented
  
  There is no clear indication of extras management functionality in the provided code snippets. The interfaces and components shown don't explicitly handle extras.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained
  
  The provided code snippets do not include any functionality related to revision history. There are no interfaces, reducers, or components that would handle tracking or displaying revision history.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components
  
  The code appears well-organized with separate files for models, store, API, components, and hooks (business logic). The separation between PageEditor.tsx (UI) and hooks like usePageForm (logic) demonstrates good separation of concerns.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved
  
  The code imports and uses the `useTranslation` hook from react-i18next, and uses the `t` function for translating strings like `t('page_details')` and `t('title_placeholder')`, showing that translation functionality is preserved.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that
