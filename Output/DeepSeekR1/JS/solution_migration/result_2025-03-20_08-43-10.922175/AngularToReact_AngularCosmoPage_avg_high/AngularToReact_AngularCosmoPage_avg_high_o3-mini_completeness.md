# Evaluation Report

1. **Fail** (90%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
   The answer implements updating (via the updatePage action) and hints at duplication in the handleSave function (through the duplicate parameter), but there is no explicit implementation for creating a new page, deleting an existing one, or a complete duplicate operation. This partial implementation leads to a failure in covering the full spectrum of page management functionalities.

2. **Fail** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
   Although the Page interface contains a 'type' field, there is no evidence of UI elements (e.g., dropdowns or selectors) or logic that enable the user to select or change the page type. The functionality for page type selection is missing.

3. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
   The usePageForm hook contains a handleTitleChange function that automatically generates the URL from the title if it is missing or set to 'new'. This satisfies the requirement for auto-generation of the URL based on the title.

4. **Fail** (90%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
   While the Page interface defines a 'tags' array and the state includes a suggestions field, the provided code does not demonstrate any UI component or logic for managing tags with autocomplete suggestions. The implementation for tag management is therefore incomplete.

5. **Fail** (80%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
   The Page interface has a 'publish' field defined as 'Y' | 'N' | 'schedule', which hints at options for publishing status. However, there is no corresponding UI or explicit business logic in the code to allow the user to select between these statuses. Hence, the functionality is only partially implemented.

6. **Fail** (90%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
   The interface and initial state include a scheduleDate field; however, there is no visible mechanism (such as a date picker or scheduling UI) in the component to manage or update a scheduled publishing date. This omission causes the scheduled publishing functionality to fall short.

7. **Fail** (85%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
   The useLocalStorageSync hook demonstrates saving and restoring page properties from local storage. Although it provides basic restoration, there is no explicit comparison of version numbers or logic to decide when to restore local data based on version changes. This partial implementation leads to a failure in fully meeting the requirement.

8. **Fail** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
   The PageEditor component logs errors via console.error but does not provide any UI-based notification system (such as toasts or alerts) that would inform the user of success or error states. This absence is critical for proper user feedback.

9. **Fail** (85%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
   The usePageForm hook implements basic validation for the URL field by checking if it exists or equals 'new'. However, there is no validation for other required fields like the page type, causing this functionality to be incomplete.

10. **Fail** (90%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
    The API service (api.ts) defines endpoints for fetching and saving content, but not all endpoints (e.g., delete, duplicate, and possibly others from the original code) are implemented. Hence, the API handling is partial.

11. **Fail** (90%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
    While the code touches on suggestions (as seen with the setSuggestions reducer and suggestions field in the Page model), there is no comprehensive implementation for managing extras or additional features (like theme pages) that might be expected from a full migration.

12. **Fail** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
    There is no implementation in the provided code for maintaining any form of revision history. This functionality is completely missing.

13. **Pass** (90%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
    The code is modularized into different files (e.g., models.ts, store.ts, api.ts, PageEditor.tsx, and custom hooks) suggesting a separation between business logic and UI components. While this organization appears clean, absolute separation might be slightly less clear in some parts (e.g., the usePageForm hook’s integration with translations), but overall the organization meets the requirement.

14. **Fail** (80%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
    The PageEditor component uses the useTranslation hook, indicating that translation functionality is present. However, the usePageForm hook calls t('page_no_url') without having imported or defined the t function, suggesting an oversight in translation integration. This discrepancy results in a failure to fully preserve the translation functionality.

15. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
    The PageEditor component makes use of React Router’s useParams and useNavigate hooks to handle URL parameters and navigation. The URL structure appears to be maintained by using these mechanisms, fulfilling the requirement.
