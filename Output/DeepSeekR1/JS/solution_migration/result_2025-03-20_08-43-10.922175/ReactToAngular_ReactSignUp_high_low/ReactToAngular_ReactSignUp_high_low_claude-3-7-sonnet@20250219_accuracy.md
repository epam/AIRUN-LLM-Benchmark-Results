# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling
  
  The SignupComponent clearly uses Angular's Reactive Forms. This is evident from the imported FormBuilder, FormGroup, Validators, and AbstractControl from '@angular/forms'. The form is created using the FormBuilder service in the constructor with `this.signupForm = this.fb.group({...})` and the form is bound to the template using the `[formGroup]` directive.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)
  
  The form validation includes the required synchronous validations:
  - Name: `[Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3), Validators.maxLength(60)]`
  - Email: `[Validators.required, Validators.email]`
  - Password: `[Validators.required, Validators.minLength(6)]`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use
  
  The component implements asynchronous validators for both name and email:
  - Name uses `[this.asyncNameValidator()]` which calls `authService.isNameAvailable()`
  - Email uses `[this.asyncEmailValidator()]` which calls `authService.isEmailAvailable()`
  
  Both validator methods properly implement the AsyncValidatorFn interface with debounce time, distinct checks, and return validation errors when the name or email is already in use.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched
  
  The form fields use the FormControlValidationComponent to display validation feedback. This component checks if the control is touched (`control.touched`) and displays error messages accordingly. The error messages are displayed conditionally based on the control's state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions
  
  The `onSubmit()` method properly:
  1. Checks if the form is valid before proceeding
  2. Sets submitting flag to true
  3. Extracts form values
  4. Calls the authService.signup method
  5. On success, dispatches the signupComplete action to the store
  6. Navigates to the home page on success
  7. Handles errors and resets the submitting flag

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails
  
  The FormControlValidationComponent is responsible for displaying error messages. It is included below each form field in the template and generates appropriate error messages based on the specific validation errors present in the control.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service
  
  The component injects Angular's Title service and sets the page title in the ngOnInit lifecycle hook using `this.title.setTitle(this.getTitle('Signup'))`, which correctly sets the title to "Signup - PodBaby".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management
  
  The component injects the Store service from '@ngrx/store' and dispatches actions using `this.store.dispatch(AuthActions.signupComplete({ user }))`. The AuthEffects class is also properly implemented with '@ngrx/effects'.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress
  
  The submit button has the `[disabled]="submitting || signupForm.invalid"` attribute, which disables the button when the form is being submitted or when it's invalid.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses
  
  The `onSubmit()` method uses the Observable subscribe method with a complete handler object that includes next, error, and complete callbacks. It properly handles success by dispatching an action and navigating, and handles errors by resetting the submitting flag.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management
  
  The component follows Angular best practices:
  - Uses OnInit lifecycle hook appropriately
  - Properly injects dependencies
  - Separates form creation from initialization
  - Uses appropriate access modifiers for methods
