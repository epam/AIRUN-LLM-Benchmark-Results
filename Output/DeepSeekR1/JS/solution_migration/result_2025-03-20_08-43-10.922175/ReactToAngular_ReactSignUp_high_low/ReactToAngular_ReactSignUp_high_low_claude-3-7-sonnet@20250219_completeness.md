# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component includes all three required form fields: name, email, and password
  
  The signup component clearly includes all three required form fields in both the component class definition and the HTML template. The FormGroup setup in the component defines controls for name, email, and password, and the HTML template renders input fields for each of these with appropriate labels and validation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page includes a heading 'Join PodBaby today.'
  
  The HTML template includes the exact heading `<h2>Join PodBaby today.</h2>` at the top of the form.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a lead paragraph about membership benefits
  
  The template includes a paragraph with the class "lead" that states "As a member you can subscribe to podcast feeds and keep track of your favorite episodes."

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form includes a submit button with appropriate styling and icon
  
  The form includes a submit button with the classes "btn btn-primary form-control" and contains a Font Awesome icon `<i class="fa fa-sign-in"></i>` followed by the text "Signup".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a link to the login page with appropriate text
  
  At the bottom of the form, there is a link `<a routerLink="/login">Already a member? Log in here.</a>` which properly links to the login page with appropriate text.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the FormGroup component or equivalent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display
  
  The code implements a custom FormControlValidationComponent that displays validation errors. This component is used for each form field to show appropriate error messages when validation fails.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Icon component or equivalent is implemented for the signup button
  
  The signup button includes a Font Awesome icon with the class "fa fa-sign-in" which represents a sign-in icon.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all validation rules are implemented (name length, email format, password length)
  
  The signup form implements all required validation rules:
  - Name: required, minLength(3), maxLength(60)
  - Email: required, email format validation
  - Password: required, minLength(6)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure asynchronous validation for both name and email uniqueness is implemented
  
  The component implements custom AsyncValidatorFn for both name and email fields that check if the values are available (not already in use) using the AuthService. These async validators debounce the input, make API calls to check availability, and return appropriate validation errors if the values are already in use.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API integration is complete with proper error handling
  
  The onSubmit method makes an API call using the AuthService's signup method and properly handles the response using RxJS subscribe with next, error, and complete handlers. It also updates the UI state (submitting flag) accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form layout matches the horizontal form structure specified
  
  The form has the class "form-horizontal" and each form field is properly structured with labels and inputs in a consistent layout, matching the horizontal form structure specification.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page has proper document title setting functionality
  
  In the ngOnInit method, the component sets the document title using the Title service with `this.title.setTitle(this.getTitle('Signup'))`, which calls a helper method to format the title as "Signup - PodBaby".
