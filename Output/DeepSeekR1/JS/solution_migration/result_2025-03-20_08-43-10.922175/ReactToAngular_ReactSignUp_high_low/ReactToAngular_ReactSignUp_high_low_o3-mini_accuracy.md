# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The component imports FormBuilder, creates a FormGroup in the constructor, and uses Angular form directives in the template.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The signup form sets Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3), Validators.maxLength(60) for the name, Validators.required and Validators.email for the email, and Validators.required with Validators.minLength(6) for the password.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  Both asyncNameValidator and asyncEmailValidator functions use the authService methods (isNameAvailable and isEmailAvailable) and incorporate debounceTime, distinctUntilChanged, and proper mapping of the response.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The FormControlValidationComponent displays error messages when controls are touched and invalid. However, while error feedback is well-handled (via a help-block div), explicit success styling isnâ€™t apparent. This might be acceptable depending on the requirements, but the component focuses primarily on error messaging.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  The onSubmit() method calls authService.signup and dispatches AuthActions.signupComplete on success, and handles error scenarios by resetting the submitting flag.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The form-control-validation.component.html shows errors using an *ngIf construct that checks for touched and invalid states of controls.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  In ngOnInit(), the component sets the page title via this.title.setTitle(this.getTitle('Signup')), resulting in "Signup - PodBaby".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The component dispatches actions to the store, and the provided auth.effects.ts uses @ngrx/effects to handle signup-related side effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button is disabled when "submitting" is true or the signupForm is invalid, preventing multiple submissions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  The API call in onSubmit() subscribes to the signup observable and handles next, error, and complete scenarios appropriately.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The code organizes dependency injections, utilizes ngOnInit for initialization, and separates concerns (validation, service calls, state management). There is minor room for discussion regarding the implementation of async validators, but overall the structure adheres to best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The AuthService uses HttpClient to make GET and POST requests with RxJS operators, which is the proper idiomatic usage in Angular.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  Error messages, such as "Name is required", "A valid email address is required", or custom messages like "This name is already in use", are appropriately generated via the FormControlValidationComponent.
