# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The code shows Angular-specific imports and decorators like `@Component`, `@Injectable`, which are consistent with Angular 14.x syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
  
  The code includes imports from '@ngrx/store' and properly implements store-related constructs like actions, reducers, and the Store service.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects

  There is no implementation of NgRx Effects in the provided code. The code should include imports from '@ngrx/effects', effect classes decorated with @Effect(), and registration of effects in the NgModule.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store

  Actions and reducers are properly implemented. Actions are defined using createAction() with appropriate props. The reducer is defined using createReducer() with on() handlers. However, selectors are not explicitly shown in the code snippets provided, though there are references to observables in the components that might be using selectors.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)

  The components correctly use @Component, @Input, and @Output decorators. For example, TodoItemComponent uses @Input for todo and editing properties, and @Output for toggle, delete, and save events.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators

  While the code shows Angular components, there is no implementation of @ViewChild decorator to replace React refs. In the TodoItemComponent, there's a reference to 'editInput' that would need @ViewChild, but the declaration is missing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling

  The components properly implement @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling, as demonstrated in the TodoItemComponent and TodoFooterComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic

  The code includes an Angular service (TodoService) for handling data persistence, demonstrating proper use of services for business logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented

  Dependency injection is correctly implemented with constructor injection for services like Store and TodoService in the AppComponent.

- **Fail** (80%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate

  There's no explicit mention of change detection strategies (like ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush) in the provided components, which would be appropriate for optimizing performance, especially in a todo list application. The evaluation mentions "Implemented change detection with OnPush strategy" but the actual code doesn't show this implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation

  Angular Router is implemented through the AppRoutingModule with proper route configuration for different todo filters.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions

  The code generally follows Angular style guide conventions with proper component structure, service implementation, and modular organization. Component names follow the [name].[type].ts pattern.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application

  TypeScript interfaces and types are well-maintained throughout the application, with proper typing for Todo models, state interfaces, and method parameters/returns.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates

  JSX templates have been correctly converted to Angular template syntax using Angular's binding syntax, structural directives, and event bindings.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings

  React event handlers have been appropriately replaced with Angular event binding syntax, such as (click), (change), and (keydown.enter).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs

  There are no TODO comments or incomplete code sections in the provided solution.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules

  The code does not implement lazy loading for feature modules. There is no evidence of loadChildren being used in the routing configuration for lazy loading modules.
