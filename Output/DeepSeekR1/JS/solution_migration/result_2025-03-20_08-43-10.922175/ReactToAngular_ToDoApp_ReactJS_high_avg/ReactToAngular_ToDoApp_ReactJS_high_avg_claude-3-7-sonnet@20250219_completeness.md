# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items

    The answer provides the code for the Angular components, but there's an issue with the TodoList component. While the AppComponent references it with `<app-todo-list>`, the actual TodoList component implementation is missing from the provided code. This component is essential for displaying the todo items.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented

    The add todo functionality is properly implemented in the AppComponent with the keydown.enter event handler that calls the addTodo method, which dispatches the appropriate NgRx action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works

    The toggle functionality is implemented in the TodoItemComponent with the appropriate output event emitter and in the todo reducer's actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented

    The editing functionality is properly implemented in the TodoItemComponent with methods for startEditing, saveEdit, and cancelEdit.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented

    The delete functionality is implemented in the TodoItemComponent with the delete output event emitter, which is triggered by the destroy button click.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented

    The toggleAll action is defined in the actions file, but the UI implementation for this feature isn't clearly shown in the provided templates. However, the action structure suggests the functionality is available.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works

    The filtering functionality is implemented with proper routing and filter constants (ALL_TODOS, ACTIVE_TODOS, COMPLETED_TODOS).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items

    The TodoFooterComponent properly displays the active count with appropriate pluralization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items

    The clear completed functionality is implemented in the TodoFooterComponent with the appropriate output event emitter and the clearCompleted action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage

    The TodoService properly handles persistence to local storage with the Utils service.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation

    The routing module correctly sets up routes that match the expected URL structure.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states

    While the component structure is in place, there's no explicit code provided for handling empty states in the UI. However, the reactive approach with observables would likely handle this automatically.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly

    Form submissions are properly handled with event binding and actions dispatched to the store.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships

    The answer is missing a key component - the TodoListComponent that would tie together the individual TodoItemComponents. Without this component, the component relationship hierarchy is incomplete.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved

    The business logic appears to be preserved in the NgRx actions and reducers, but the todoReducer implementation is incomplete, showing only a few of the needed reducer cases.
