# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The answer explicitly states that it is a migration “to Angular 14.x” and the code uses Angular modules, components, and dependency injection which are in line with Angular 14.x practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The code imports and uses @ngrx/store in actions, reducers, and services. This confirms that state management is handled by NgRx.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  The provided migration code does not show any use of @ngrx/effects. No effects modules or associated logic are present despite the evaluation step requiring it.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  While actions and reducers are defined, there is no evidence of selectors being implemented. Selectors are key to accessing store slices in NgRx, and their absence means this requirement is not fully met.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  All components (e.g., AppComponent, TodoItemComponent, TodoFooterComponent) correctly use the Angular decorators @Component, @Input, and @Output, which are required for proper component definition and communication.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  In the TodoItemComponent template, a template reference variable (#editInput) is used; however, the component code does not declare a corresponding @ViewChild to access it. This indicates that the migration did not fully replace React refs with Angular’s @ViewChild.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  The components properly receive inputs and emit outputs using @Input() and @Output() with EventEmitter, ensuring proper communication among components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  The migration includes Angular services (e.g., TodoService and Utils) that handle persistence and utility functions, demonstrating a proper use of services.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  Dependency injection is correctly implemented in the constructors of components and services (e.g., injecting Store and TodoService), fulfilling this requirement.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  Although the explanation mentions the OnPush strategy, none of the component decorators specify a changeDetection strategy (e.g., ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush), so this optimization is missing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  The migration includes a routing module (app-routing.module.ts) that sets up routes using RouterModule, confirming that Angular Router is employed.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code is modularized and adheres to many Angular style guidelines. However, a few advanced patterns (such as lazy loading or explicit change detection configurations) are missing, thus a slight deduction in confidence.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  The migration defines interfaces (e.g., TodoState) and makes use of types across actions, reducers, and components, indicating strong type safety.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  The provided UI is written using Angular template syntax, with proper HTML templates embedded in component decorators.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  The code replaces React-style event handlers (e.g., onClick) with Angular event bindings (e.g., (click), (keydown.enter)), fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  There are no “TODO” comments in the provided code. Other inline comments exist for guidance, but no outstanding tasks are indicated.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  The migration does not demonstrate the use of Angular lazy loading for feature modules. All modules appear to be loaded eagerly.
