# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The provided migration uses an <code>app-todo-list</code> component and binds an observable named <code>filteredTodos$</code>, but the implementation details of the todo list (including the rendering of all items) are missing. Without the full implementation of the list component and its selectors, we cannot be sure that all todo items are actually displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The <code>AppComponent</code> defines an <code>addTodo</code> method triggered on the Enter key press, which dispatches the appropriate <code>addTodo</code> action. This indicates that adding new items is handled.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  In the <code>TodoItemComponent</code>, a checkbox is used to emit a <code>toggle</code> event upon change. While the component wiring is correct, complete integration with state management (and handling of the <code>toggleTodo</code> action) is not fully shown.  
  Explanation: The event emission is implemented, but the processing of that event in the broader application context is not detailed.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  The migration provides an editing interface in <code>TodoItemComponent</code> with methods <code>startEditing</code>, <code>saveEdit</code>, and <code>cancelEdit</code>. However, the code attempts to call <code>this.editInput.nativeElement.focus()</code> without defining or capturing <code>editInput</code> via a <code>@ViewChild</code> or similar mechanism. This oversight means that the editing functionality is incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  The <code>TodoItemComponent</code> includes a delete button that emits a <code>delete</code> event to remove the item. Additionally, a corresponding <code>deleteTodo</code> action is defined in the NgRx actions. This suggests that deletion functionality is present.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  Although a <code>toggleAll</code> action is defined in the NgRx actions, there is no visible UI control or related handling in the components to mark all todos as complete/incomplete.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  The migration defines routes in the <code>AppRoutingModule</code> for different filters and the <code>TodoFooterComponent</code> includes links that compare the current filter. However, detailed implementation of filter logic and state selectors (e.g., computing <code>filteredTodos$</code>) is omitted, so while the intent is present, the completeness is uncertain.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The <code>TodoFooterComponent</code> accepts an <code>activeCount</code> input and displays it inside a <code>strong</code> element. This demonstrates that the footer is set up to show the count of active items.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The footer includes a button that emits a <code>clearCompleted</code> event, and a corresponding action <code>clearCompleted</code> is defined. However, the reducer logic to handle that action (and thus actually remove completed todos) is not implemented in the provided code. This leaves the functionality incomplete.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  The <code>TodoService</code> contains a method to load todos from local storage and one to save todos. Nonetheless, only the loading function is used (in <code>ngOnInit</code>), and there is no mechanism shown that calls <code>saveToStorage</code> (for example, after adding or updating a todo). Therefore, persistence is only half-implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The <code>AppRoutingModule</code> sets up routes for the default path as well as for active and completed filters using well-defined constants. This indicates that the URL structure is maintained properly across navigational states.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  There is no explicit handling or messaging for empty states, such as when there are no todos, in the provided templates. This is a missing aspect of user experience.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  The <code>AppComponent</code> listens for the <code>keydown.enter</code> event on the input field to trigger the <code>addTodo</code> method, which handles and sanitizes the user input before dispatching an action. This indicates correct form submission handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The migration clearly segments responsibilities across components (AppComponent, TodoItemComponent, TodoFooterComponent) and utilizes Angularâ€™s dependency injection and data binding mechanisms appropriately. Although the <code>app-todo-list</code> component is referenced but not fully shown, the visible components exhibit proper relationships.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  While many core aspects (adding, deleting, toggling, filtering) are addressed, several functionalities (such as complete editing, marking all as complete, properly clearing completed items, and full persistence logic) are either partially implemented or missing. This suggests that not all original business logic is fully preserved in the migration.
