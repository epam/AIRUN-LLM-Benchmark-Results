# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The code appears to be designed for Angular 14, implementing Angular components, services, NgRx, etc. However, there's no explicit version declaration in the code (like in package.json), which is why I'm not 100% confident.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS
  
  The code consistently uses ES modules with import/export syntax throughout all the components, services, and store files.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management
  
  NgRx store is clearly implemented with proper imports from '@ngrx/store' and the StoreModule is included in the app.module.ts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects
  
  NgRx effects are implemented correctly with imports from '@ngrx/effects' and the EffectsModule is included in the app.module.ts. The TodoEffects class is also properly defined.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management
  
  The code includes proper actions (addTodo, toggleTodo, etc.), reducers, and effects for todo management. Though selectors aren't explicitly defined in a separate file, they are implied through the store.select usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator
  
  The TodoStorageService uses the @Injectable decorator with providedIn: 'root', which is the recommended approach in Angular.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service
  
  The TodoStorageService properly implements localStorage for data persistence with methods to get and save todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators
  
  All component classes correctly use the @Component decorator with appropriate metadata like selector and template.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators
  
  The TodoFocusDirective correctly uses the @Directive decorator with a selector.

- **Fail** (80%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)
  
  While the components use Angular template syntax for binding and events, I don't see explicit examples of structural directives like *ngFor or *ngIf in the provided code snippets. The main component and item components would likely use these, but they're not shown in the templates provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))
  
  The code correctly uses Angular event binding syntax like (click), (change), (blur), and (keydown.enter).

- **Fail** (80%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])
  
  While the code does use property binding like [checked] and [todoFocus], I don't see specific class bindings like [class.completed] which would be expected in a todo application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed
  
  The TodoFocusDirective implements ngAfterViewInit lifecycle hook correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models
  
  The Todo interface is properly defined in the todo.reducer.ts file.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services
  
  Dependency injection is correctly implemented in components and services using constructor injection.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code generally follows Angular style guide conventions with proper naming, file organization, and structure. Not 100% confident without seeing all the files.

- **Fail** (70%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings
  
  Since this is just code without an actual running application, it's not possible to verify console errors or warnings. The code structure looks solid, but there might be runtime issues.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)
  
  The code makes appropriate use of TypeScript features including interfaces, typing parameters, an
