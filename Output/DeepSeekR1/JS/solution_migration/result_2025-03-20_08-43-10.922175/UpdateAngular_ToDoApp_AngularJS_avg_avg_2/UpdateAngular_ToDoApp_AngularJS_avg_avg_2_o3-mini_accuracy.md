# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The answer explicitly states the migration is to Angular 14 and the code reflects Angular best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
  The code uses ECMAScript module syntax via the "import" statements in every file.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
  The code includes NgRx store files (actions, reducer) and the AppModule integrates StoreModule.forRoot with the todoReducer.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
  The AppModule imports EffectsModule.forRoot with TodoEffects, and the TodoEffects file is provided.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
  The answer defines a set of NgRx actions, a reducer that handles some actions, and effects for loading and saving todos. However, dedicated selectors are not separated into a different file; instead, inline selectors (store.select(state => state.todos.todos)) are used. This is acceptable in simpler applications, though separate selectors might be expected for larger projects.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
  The TodoStorage service is decorated with @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }), confirming proper injection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
  The TodoStorageService uses localStorage with getTodos() and saveTodos() methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
  AppComponent and TodoItemComponent are correctly decorated with @Component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
  The TodoFocusDirective is correctly implemented and decorated with @Directive.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
  The provided templates use Angular interpolation and binding. Although the examples do not explicitly show *ngFor or *ngIf in this snippet, the usage of Angular template syntax is evident. For a full evaluation, more context about each component might be required, but based on available code, it is acceptable.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
  Event bindings like (change), (click), (blur), (keydown.enter), and (keydown.escape) are used correctly in the templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
  Binding syntax such as [checked] and [todoFocus] is correctly implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
  The TodoFocusDirective implements the AfterViewInit lifecycle hook appropriately to handle focusing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
  The code defines TypeScript interfaces such as Todo and TodoState, which is appropriate.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
  Dependencies are correctly injected via constructor parameters in both components (e.g., Store in AppComponent) and services (e.g., TodoStorageService in TodoEffects).

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code is modularized into separate files for actions, reducers, effects, services, components, and directives. Although minor improvements could be made (for example, using dedicated selector files or additional commentary in complex cases), overall conventions appear to be followed well.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
  There are no obvious errors in the provided code. However, since the code hasn’t been executed in an actual Angular CLI environment as part of this review, this evaluation is based on a static analysis of the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
  The code leverages TypeScript’s features such as type annotations, interfaces for data modeling, and proper wiring of modules.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
  The answer does not include commented-out code blocks or leftover TODO comments that affect code quality (aside from a brief placeholder comment "// Add other action handlers" which is acceptable).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design  
  The application clearly separates concerns among components, services, directives, and NgRx store elements, each handling a single part of the functionality.
