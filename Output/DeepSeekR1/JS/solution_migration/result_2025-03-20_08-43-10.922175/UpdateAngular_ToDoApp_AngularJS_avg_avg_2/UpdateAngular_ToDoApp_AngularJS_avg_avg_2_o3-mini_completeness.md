# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list  
  Although the code does not show an explicit "todo list" component, the AppModule declares a MainComponent (typically responsible for displaying the list) along with a TodoItemComponent. Thus, we assume the intent is met. The evidence is indirect, so confidence is 80%.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos  
  The migration references a HeaderComponent (commonly used for inputting new todos) in the AppComponent template. While the header’s implementation is not shown, its declaration suggests this responsibility. Confidence is 80% due to lack of explicit code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos  
  The TodoItemComponent contains methods (startEdit, commitEdit, cancelEdit) that provide editing functionality. This meets the requirement fully.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos  
  The module declares a FooterComponent, which in many todo applications is used to display filtering options (e.g., All, Active, Completed). No explicit filtering logic is shown, but the component’s presence gives reasonable cause to pass. Confidence is 80%.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics  
  Similar to filtering, the FooterComponent is likely responsible for displaying statistics such as the count of remaining todos. Although its implementation is missing, its intended usage in typical Angular todo apps supports a pass at 80% confidence.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos  
  The existence of an addTodo action in the NgRx store (and its handling in the reducer, even if minimal) indicates that functionality to add todos is implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos  
  The TodoItemComponent includes logic for editing (e.g., startEdit and commitEdit), which confirms that editing functionality is present.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos  
  A removeTodo action is defined in the actions file, and the TodoItemComponent emits a remove event. Although the reducer’s code for deletion is not fully shown (it is commented as “Add other action handlers”), the existence of the action and trigger in the component suggests intended support. Confidence is 90% due to the incomplete reducer implementation provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed  
  There is a toggleTodo action, and the TodoItemComponent uses a checkbox to emit toggle events. This clearly indicates the functionality to mark todos as completed is implemented.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)  
  No explicit filtering logic (e.g., actions, reducer cases, or component code handling filter changes) is provided. Although a FooterComponent is declared (which would typically handle filtering), there is no code demonstrating the filtering functionality. Thus, this requirement is not fully met.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete  
  Even though a toggleAll action is declared, there is no corresponding reducer logic or component implementation shown to handle marking all todos complete/incomplete. The lack of concrete implementation leads to a fail on this step.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos  
  The clearCompleted action is defined, but like toggleAll, there is no visible reducer implementation or supporting code to actually clear completed todos. This functionality appears to be intended but is not demonstrated.

- **Fail** (80%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos  
  The expectation is that statistics, such as the count of remaining todos, are rendered (likely in the FooterComponent), but no code is provided to confirm this behavior. Thus, the evidence is insufficient, and this step fails.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage  
  The TodoStorageService explicitly provides getTodos and saveTodos methods utilizing localStorage, meeting this requirement.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization  
  The TodoEffects attempts to load todos using loadTodos and loadTodosSuccess. However, the service’s getTodos method returns a synchronous array rather than an Observable. Since the effect uses .pipe on storage.getTodos(), it suggests a type mismatch and incomplete implementation. Therefore, this step fails.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing  
  The TodoItemComponent binds (keydown.escape) to the cancelEdit() method, verifying that the escape key press is handled to cancel editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo  
  The custom TodoFocusDirective is applied in the TodoItemComponent, ensuring that the input field is focused automatically when a todo is edited.

- **Fail** (50%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original  
  There is no CSS or template detail provided to compare visual appearance. Without these details, it is not possible to verify this requirement. Confidence is low at 50% due to insufficient information.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately  
  In the commitEdit() method, the code checks if the trimmed text is non-empty before emitting an edit event. This demonstrates proper handling of empty titles.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter  
  There is no router-related code or logic provided to suggest that the URL is being updated to reflect the selected filter. This important functionality is missing.
