# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed
  
  The code includes a `NewTodoInput` component in App.tsx that correctly handles the Enter key press event, trims the input value, dispatches the addTodo action, and clears the input field.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter
  
  The code includes TodoList component references and filter-related logic. While we don't see the complete implementation of TodoList, the App component sets up filter handling based on URL paths and uses the Redux state to manage todos, which strongly suggests that todos are displayed according to the current filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos
  
  The Redux slice includes a `toggleAll` action that correctly sets all todos' completed status to the provided boolean value.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted
  
  The TodoItem component clearly implements handlers for toggling (`handleToggle`), editing (`handleEdit`, `handleSubmit`), and deleting (`handleDelete`) todos with the appropriate Redux actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode
  
  The TodoItem component includes a label with an `onDoubleClick={handleEdit}` event handler that enables editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo
  
  The TodoItem component includes a `handleKeyDown` function that specifically checks for the Enter key and calls `handleSubmit` to save the edited todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value
  
  The TodoItem component's `handleKeyDown` function checks for the Escape key and resets the edit text to the original todo title.

- **Pass** (80%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items
  
  While we can see a TodoFooter component is included, its detailed implementation isn't provided. However, the todo state management includes completed status tracking, which would allow for counting active items.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The code shows routing setup and visibility filter state management with the defined filter types 'all', 'active', and 'completed'. The App component has location-based filter handling, strongly suggesting that filter functionality is implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos
  
  The Redux slice includes a `clearCompleted` action that filters out completed todos, and this would be connected to a UI component that calls this action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence
  
  The code includes dedicated localStorage utility functions (`loadState` and `saveState`) and subscribes to store changes to save the state to localStorage.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state
  
  The TodoItem component uses className conditionals based on the todo's completed and editing states, indicating that UI elements are conditionally displayed based on state.

- **Fail** (80%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count
  
  While the application handles todo counts, there is no visible code that specifically handles pluralization of the word "item" based on the count. This functionality is typically found in the footer component, which is not fully shown.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components
  
  The code demonstrates good component composition with separate components for App, NewTodoInput, TodoItem, TodoList, and TodoFooter, each with focused responsibilities.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality
  
  The code shows clear organization by feature, with directories like "features/todos" and "features/filters" containing related components and slices.
