# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The NewTodoInput component listens for the 'Enter' key and dispatches the addTodo action accordingly.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The App component retrieves the todos from the store and dispatches setVisibilityFilter based on the URL path. Although the actual filtering logic appears to be delegated to the TodoList component (whose implementation is not shown), the overall design implies that filtering is performed. The confidence is 90% because the filtering logic is assumed rather than explicitly demonstrated.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  The todosSlice includes a toggleAll reducer which updates the 'completed' property for every todo. This ensures that the functionality exists even if its UI hook is not shown.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  The TodoItem component implements handleToggle for toggling, handleEdit for initiating edit mode, and handleDelete for deleting a todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  The TodoItem component attaches the handleEdit function to the label’s onDoubleClick event, successfully enabling editing mode when double-clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  In the TodoItem component, pressing 'Enter' triggers the handleSubmit function, which dispatches updateTodo (or deleteTodo when appropriate).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  Within the handleKeyDown callback in TodoItem, pressing 'Escape' resets the editText state to the original todo title, effectively canceling the edit.

- **Pass** (80%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  The App component imports and renders TodoFooter. While its implementation is not provided, it is assumed that TodoFooter shows the count of active items. The 80% confidence level is due to the absence of explicit code for displaying this count.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The TodoFooter component is rendered and the App component manages the visibility filter by dispatching setVisibilityFilter on route changes. Although the detailed implementation of filter controls is not shown, the structure suggests that filter functionality is integrated. The confidence level is 80% because the internal implementation is not demonstrated.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  The todosSlice defines a clearCompleted reducer, implying that a UI control (likely in TodoFooter) exists to trigger this action. Confidence is at 90% because the actual button isn’t shown in the provided code, but its functionality is available.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  The store configuration subscribes to state changes and invokes saveState from localStorage.ts. This guarantees that todos persist in localStorage.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  The TodoItem component uses the classNames library to conditionally apply classes (e.g., completed, editing). Although some conditional UI behavior is assumed (such as in TodoFooter), the overall structure suggests dynamic UI updates based on todo state. The confidence is 90% as not every conditional rendering detail is fully shown.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  There is no provided implementation for pluralizing the text for the count of active items (e.g., toggling between "item" and "items"). This functionality is missing explicitly in the provided migration code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The migration has decomposed the application into well-defined components (e.g., NewTodoInput, TodoList, TodoFooter, TodoItem) and organized logic using Redux slices, indicating proper component composition.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The file structure demonstrates clear separation, with folders such as features/todos and features/filters, which confirms that the code is organized by feature.
