# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration  
  The project is initialized with “npx create-react-app virtual-piano --template typescript”, confirming the correct setup.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure  
  Although the audio mapping is handled using a Record type (Record<NoteType, string> for soundFiles and Record<string, HTMLAudioElement> for soundMapper), the code employs strict TypeScript typing. This meets the intent of using TypeScript types/interfaces.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks  
  All components (e.g., PianoKey, Piano, Controls, FullscreenButton, App) are defined as functional components and make appropriate use of hooks like useState, useEffect, and useCallback.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)  
  The code properly uses useState for state management (e.g., activeKeys, mode, isMouseDown) and useEffect for handling side effects (such as event listeners and initializing audio instances).

- **Fail** (90%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels  
  While keyboard event handlers are added in the App component’s useEffect, they reference variables (whiteKeys and sharpKeys) that are defined only in the Piano component and not imported or declared in App. This discrepancy would lead to runtime errors. The failure is marked with 90% confidence because, although the intent is clear, the code does not correctly scope or import the necessary key configuration arrays.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events  
  The PianoKey component utilizes React’s synthetic events (onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseEnter, onMouseLeave) adequately to manage user interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment  
  Audio instances are created and cached via useRef, and proper error handling is implemented during playback, ensuring effective audio resource management.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility  
  The FullscreenButton component correctly checks for fullscreen status, uses requestFullscreen/exitFullscreen appropriately, and catches potential errors, demonstrating good browser compatibility handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns  
  The use of template literals in className usage (e.g., in PianoKey) confirms that conditional class application follows correct React patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm performance optimizations like React.memo are used  
  Components such as PianoKey, Piano, Controls, and FullscreenButton are wrapped in React.memo, which showcases an effective performance optimization strategy.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure audio playback is handled with proper React lifecycle considerations  
  The App component’s useEffect that initializes the audio objects, along with useCallback handlers for playing audio, demonstrates correct integration with the React lifecycle.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application  
  The codebase makes extensive use of TypeScript types and interfaces for component props and state. However, the keyboard event handler in App references whiteKeys and sharpKeys without proper type declarations or imports, slightly reducing the overall strictness adherence.
