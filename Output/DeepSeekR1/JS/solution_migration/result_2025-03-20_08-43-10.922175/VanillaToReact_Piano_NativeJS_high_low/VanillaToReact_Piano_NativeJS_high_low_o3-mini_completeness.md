# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'.  
  The App component renders a header element with an h1 tag containing the "Virtual Piano" title.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons.  
  The Controls component includes a div with class "btn-container" and two buttons labeled "Notes" and "Letters", fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys).  
  The Piano component maps over defined arrays (whiteKeys and sharpKeys) to render both natural and sharp keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes.  
  In the PianoKey component, data attributes "data-letter" and "data-note" are correctly set on the rendered div.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked.  
  The App component’s handlePressKey function correctly uses a sound mapper (populated from the soundFiles mapping) to play the corresponding audio when a key is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed).  
  The PianoKey component uses conditional class names (including "piano-key-active") based on the activeKeys state to visually highlight pressed keys.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes.  
  The App component’s useEffect for keyboard events references whiteKeys and sharpKeys; however, these arrays are defined only in the Piano component and are not accessible in App. This causes a scoping issue where the keyboard event handlers will fail, preventing correct handling of keyboard input.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked.  
  The Controls component correctly calls onChangeMode on button click, and the App component passes down the mode to show either letters or notes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes.  
  The FullscreenButton component implements a toggle using the Fullscreen API (requestFullscreen and exitFullscreen) with proper error handling.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly.  
  The activeKeys state is managed as an array, and new keys are added if not already active. This suggests that simultaneous key presses are supported. There could be edge cases with rapid or overlapping press events, but the implementation appears solid overall.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys.  
  The PianoKey component defines onMouseEnter and onMouseLeave handlers that trigger press and release events based on the isMouseDown state, enabling smooth mouse drag functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information.  
  The App component renders a footer that includes a div with the text "2020", meeting the requirement.
