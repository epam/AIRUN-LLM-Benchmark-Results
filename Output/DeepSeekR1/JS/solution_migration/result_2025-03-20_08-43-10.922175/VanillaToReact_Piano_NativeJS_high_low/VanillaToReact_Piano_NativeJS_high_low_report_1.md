## Run 1:
### Thoughts:
Okay, I need to migrate this vanilla JavaScript piano app to React 18 with TypeScript. Let me start by understanding the original code's structure and functionality.

First, looking at the HTML, there's a header, main section with buttons for notes/letters, the piano keys (both white and black), a fullscreen button, and a footer. The script.js handles event listeners for mouse and keyboard, plays sounds, toggles classes for active states, and manages the note/letters display.

In React, I'll need to break this into components. The main components could be PianoKey, Piano, Controls (for the notes/letters buttons), and FullscreenButton. The App component will hold everything together.

For state management, the Notes/Letters toggle is a UI state, so I'll use useState. The active keys (when a key is pressed) can be tracked with a state array. Also, the current mode (notes or letters) needs to be stateful.

The audio files are loaded in the original via an object. In React, I should import them and maybe use useRef to keep the Audio instances so they don't re-initialize on re-renders. But since React's useEffect runs after render, maybe initializing them in a useMemo or a context would be better.

Event handling: The original uses keydown, keyup, mousedown, etc. In React, I'll convert these to onKeyDown, onKeyUp, onMouseDown, etc. But keyboard events need to be handled at the document level. Wait, in React, attaching event listeners to the document directly isn't the usual pattern. Maybe use useEffect to add and remove event listeners for keyboard events, similar to the original, but within a React component's lifecycle.

Wait, but React's synthetic events are attached to specific elements. For global keyboard events, I might need to add event listeners to the document inside a useEffect hook. That's acceptable as long as I clean them up.

The play function in the original checks if the event is a KeyboardEvent or mouse event. In React, the keyboard events would be handled via the document listeners, and mouse events via the PianoKey components' props.

For the PianoKey component, each key should accept its note, letter, and whether it's a sharp. When a key is pressed (via mouse or keyboard), it should trigger the play function. The active state (piano-key-active class) is determined by whether the note is in the activeKeys state.

The original uses data attributes like data-letter and data-note. In React, these can be passed as props and accessed in event handlers.

The Notes/Letters toggle changes the class on the piano container. In React, this can be a state that toggles the 'letters' class on the piano div.

Fullscreen functionality: The original uses a function that checks if fullscreen is active. In React, this can be a handler in a FullscreenButton component, using the document's fullscreen API. Need to handle browser prefixes for compatibility.

Styling: The CSS classes need to be preserved. In React, I'll use className and conditionally apply classes using template literals or classnames library. For example, a PianoKey's className would be `piano-key ${isSharp ? 'sharp' : ''} ${isActive ? 'piano-key-active' : ''}`.

TypeScript interfaces: Define types for the props of each component. For example, PianoKeyProps would include note, letter, isSharp, isActive, onPlay, onRelease.

Audio handling: The original initializes Audio objects once. In React, maybe use a useRef to store the soundMapper so it doesn't re-initialize on every render. Or create a context that holds the audio files.

Wait, in the original, soundMapper is an object with Audio instances. In React, since components can re-render, we need to make sure that the Audio objects are not recreated each time, which would cause issues. So using useRef to store the soundMapper would be appropriate. Initialize it once when the component mounts.

But how to handle this in a functional component? Maybe in a custom hook or within the App component's useRef.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Set up the project with Create React App and TypeScript.

2. Create components:

   - App: main component, holds state for mode (notes/letters), activeKeys, and handles fullscreen.

   - Piano: renders the piano keys, both white and sharp. It receives the current mode (letters class) and handles mouse events.

   - PianoKey: individual key component, handles mouse down/up/leave, and applies active class if its note is in activeKeys.

   - Controls: the buttons to toggle between notes and letters.

   - FullscreenButton: button to toggle fullscreen.

3. State management:

   - mode: 'notes' | 'letters' state in App, toggled by Controls.

   - activeKeys: an array of notes currently being played, managed in App. When a key is pressed, add the note to activeKeys; when released, remove it.

4. Audio handling:

   - Create a soundMapper using useRef, initializing Audio objects once.

   - When a note is played, get the Audio from soundMapper and play it.

5. Event handling:

   - Keyboard events: useEffect in App that adds event listeners for keydown and keyup. When a key is pressed, find the corresponding note, add to activeKeys, play sound. On keyup, remove from activeKeys.

   - Mouse events: Each PianoKey has onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseLeave. These trigger functions passed from App to add/remove the note from activeKeys.

   - For mouse movement while holding down (mousemove with button pressed), perhaps track the mouse state in the Piano component, but that might be complex. Alternatively, handle it via onMouseEnter while the mouse is down.

6. Fullscreen: Implement a function in App that toggles fullscreen using the document API, handling prefixes for different browsers.

7. Styling: Import the CSS file into the App component. Use className with conditional strings based on state.

8. TypeScript interfaces:

   - Define NoteType as the possible note values.

   - Props for each component with required props.

Potential issues:

- The original handles mousemove with button pressed to trigger play. In React, this might require tracking whether the mouse is down globally and then handling onMouseEnter over keys. Alternatively, in the Piano component, track mouse down state and handle onMouseEnter events when the mouse is down.

Wait, in the original code, when the mouse moves over a key while the button is held down (from a mousedown event), it plays the note. So in React, the Piano component can have a state isMouseDown, and when onMouseDown is triggered on a key, set isMouseDown to true. Then, onMouseEnter events while isMouseDown is true would trigger playing the note. Similarly, onMouseUp anywhere would set isMouseDown to false.

But this needs to be handled at the Piano level, so that moving between keys while holding the mouse down triggers the play event.

So, in the Piano component:

- State: isMouseDown (boolean)

- onMouseDown on a key: set isMouseDown to true, play the note.

- onMouseUp: set isMouseDown to false, release all notes.

Wait, but the original code's mousemove handler checks if event.buttons === 1 (left button pressed). So perhaps in React, the Piano component can have an onMouseMove handler that checks if the mouse is down, and then finds the key under the cursor.

But that might be complex. Alternatively, each PianoKey can handle onMouseEnter and check if the mouse is currently down (tracked via state). So:

- In App or Piano, track a isMouseDown state.

- When a mouse down event occurs on any key, set isMouseDown to true.

- When mouse up occurs, set isMouseDown to false.

- Then, in each PianoKey's onMouseEnter, if isMouseDown is true, trigger the play function.

This way, dragging over keys while holding the mouse down will activate them.

So, the Piano component would manage the isMouseDown state, and pass it down to PianoKey components. Each PianoKey's onMouseEnter would check if isMouseDown is true, and if so, play the note.

But how to track the current note when moving the mouse? The onMouseEnter event of the PianoKey can trigger the play function for that specific key.

So, the flow would be:

1. User clicks down on a key: onMouseDown triggers, sets isMouseDown to true, plays the note.

2. User moves mouse to another key while holding down: onMouseEnter of the new key triggers, checks if isMouseDown is true, plays the new note and releases the old one.

But in the original code, when you move the mouse while holding down, it plays the note under the cursor, and adds it to the played array, but also removes the previous note when the mouse leaves. Wait, the original code's mousemove handler checks event.buttons and calls play(event), which would find the current target element.

Hmm, perhaps in React, the approach of tracking isMouseDown in the Piano component, and then in each PianoKey's onMouseEnter, if isMouseDown is true, trigger the play function for that key.

But also, when the mouse leaves a key, it should reset. The original uses mouseout on the piano element, which in React would be onMouseLeave. But perhaps each key's onMouseLeave should trigger a release, but only if the mouse is down.

Alternatively, when the mouse is down and moves out of a key, the active state should be removed. This might require handling onMouseLeave on each key, and if isMouseDown is true, release the note.

This could get complicated. Let me think.

Original code's piano element has event listeners for mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove. The mousemove handler checks if the buttons are pressed (event.buttons === 1) and then calls play(event), which uses event.target.

In React, the equivalent would be to have onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseMove on the piano container. Then, in onMouseMove, check if the mouse is down (tracked via state), and if so, find the current target under the mouse, and play that note.

But how to get the target element in React's synthetic event. Wait, in React's onMouseMove event, the event.target would be the element that the mouse is over. So, perhaps in the Piano component's onMouseMove handler, if isMouseDown is true, find the piano-key element under the cursor and trigger play.

But how to get the data-note and data-letter from the target? Since React uses synthetic events, the target could be a child element, so we need to find the closest .piano-key element.

Alternatively, each PianoKey component can handle its own onMouseEnter and onMouseLeave, and when the mouse is down, trigger play/release.

This might be more manageable. So, the Piano component tracks isMouseDown state. When a PianoKey is clicked (onMouseDown), it sets isMouseDown to true and plays the note. When the mouse is released anywhere (onMouseUp on the document?), it sets isMouseDown to false and releases all notes. Then, when the mouse enters another PianoKey while isMouseDown is true, that key's onMouseEnter triggers the play function.

But how to handle the mouse up event outside the piano? Maybe add a useEffect that listens for mouseup events on the document to set isMouseDown to false.

Alternatively, the Piano component can have onMouseDown and onMouseUp handlers that set the isMouseDown state. But if the user releases the mouse outside the piano, the onMouseUp wouldn't trigger. So, perhaps better to track mouse down state globally.

Wait, in the original code, the piano element has the mousedown and mouseup listeners. But in React, if the user presses down on a key (inside the piano) and releases outside, the mouseup event might not be captured by the piano element. So, the original code's mouseup listener is on the piano, which may not catch releases outside. However, the original also has a mouseout event listener on the piano which calls resetActive. Hmm.

This is getting a bit complex. Let's outline the event flow for mouse interactions:

- When the user presses a key (mousedown), play the note and add active class.

- If the user moves the mouse while holding down (mousemove), check which key is under the cursor and play that note, releasing the previous one.

- When the user releases the mouse (mouseup), release the active note.

- If the mouse leaves the piano element (mouseout), release the active note.

In React, to replicate this:

1. The Piano component manages the isMouseDown state.

2. onMouseDown on any key sets isMouseDown to true and plays the note.

3. onMouseMove on the Piano container: if isMouseDown is true, find the current key under the cursor and play it.

4. onMouseUp on the Piano container sets isMouseDown to false and releases all notes.

5. onMouseLeave on the Piano container (mouseout) releases all notes.

But how to track the current key during mousemove? The event's target during mousemove would be the element under the cursor. So, in the onMouseMove handler, we can check if the target is a piano key, get its data-note, and play it.

But in React, the event is a synthetic event, and we can access event.target as usual. However, we need to ensure that the target is a .piano-key element. So, in the handler:

const handleMouseMove = (e: React.MouseEvent) => {
  if (isMouseDown) {
    const target = e.target as HTMLElement;
    const pianoKey = target.closest('.piano-key');
    if (pianoKey) {
      const note = pianoKey.dataset.note;
      // play the note
    }
  }
};

But this requires that the Piano component's onMouseMove is attached to the container, and that the piano keys are rendered within it.

So, the Piano component would have:

<div className={`piano ${mode === 'letters' ? 'letters' : ''}`} 
  onMouseDown={handleMouseDown}
  onMouseUp={handleMouseUp}
  onMouseLeave={handleMouseLeave}
  onMouseMove={handleMouseMove}
>
  {/* piano keys */}
</div>

But the handleMouseDown would be triggered when any key is pressed, since the event bubbles up. Wait, no: the onMouseDown is on the piano container, so it would trigger when clicking anywhere inside, including the keys. But we need to determine which key was clicked. Alternatively, handle onMouseDown on each PianoKey component, which would then call a function passed from the parent to handle the note play.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to handle mouse events on the individual PianoKey components, but then the mouse move across keys while holding down would require tracking the isMouseDown state globally.

Alternatively, the Piano component can handle the mouse events as follows:

- When the mouse is down anywhere in the piano, set isMouseDown to true.

- On mouse move, if isMouseDown is true, find the current key under the cursor and play it.

- On mouse up, set isMouseDown to false and release all notes.

- On mouse leave, release all notes.

This approach would require that the Piano component's container captures these events.

But the individual PianoKey components would still need their own event handlers for mouse down to initiate the play, but maybe the Piano's handlers can take care of it.

Wait, perhaps the Piano component's onMouseDown handler can determine which key was pressed and trigger the play function. Similarly for onMouseMove.

But how to get the note from the event target in the Piano's handlers.

In the handleMouseDown function:

const handleMouseDown = (e: React.MouseEvent) => {
  const target = e.target as HTMLElement;
  const pianoKey = target.closest('.piano-key');
  if (pianoKey) {
    const note = pianoKey.dataset.note;
    if (note) {
      // play the note
      setActiveKeys(prev => [...prev, note]);
      // play audio
    }
  }
  setIsMouseDown(true);
};

Similarly, handleMouseMove would check if isMouseDown is true, find the key under the cursor, and play it.

But this could lead to multiple notes being played as the mouse moves, which is the intended behavior.

However, in the original code, when you press a key and move the mouse while holding down, it continuously plays the note under the cursor. The played array is used to prevent the same note from being played multiple times while the key is held. But in the original, when you move to a new key, it adds the new note to played and removes the old one.

Wait, looking at the original play function:

When a mousemove event occurs with buttons === 1, it calls play(event), which gets the target element (the current key under the mouse). It checks if the note is already in the played array. If not, it adds it and plays the sound. But when you move to a new key, the previous key's note is still in the played array, so the new note is added, but the old one is not removed until the resetActive function is called.

Wait, no. The original code's resetActive is called on mouseup or mouseout. So, when moving the mouse while holding down, each new key's note is added to the played array, and the previous ones remain. But that's not correct. There's a bug here.

Wait, in the original code, when you press a key, play adds the note to the played array. If you move the mouse to another key while holding down, the mousemove event triggers play again, which checks if the new note is in played. If not, it adds it. So, if you move from C to D, both notes are in played and their elements have the active class. But when you release the mouse, resetActive is called for the last key, but the others remain. That's a problem.

Ah, this indicates a flaw in the original code. The played array accumulates notes as you move the mouse while holding down, but they are only removed on keyup or mouseout. So, the active classes would stack up. That's not correct behavior. The intended behavior is probably that only one note is active at a time when using the mouse, but the original code allows multiple.

But since the user wants to preserve all existing functionality, I need to replicate this, even if it's a flaw. So, in React, the played array (activeKeys state) can have multiple notes if the user moves the mouse over multiple keys while holding down.

But in the original code, when you press a key, then move the mouse to another while holding down, the new note is played and added to played, and the previous note's active class is not removed. So, both keys would appear active until the mouse is released.

This is a problem. The original code's resetActive function is called on mouseup, mouseout, or keyup. But during mousemove, it doesn't reset previous notes. So, the active classes accumulate.

To replicate this, in React, the activeKeys state would be an array, and each new note during mousemove (while mouse is down) is added to the array if not already present. When the mouse is released or leaves the piano, the array is cleared.

But this would cause all keys that were touched during the mouse drag to remain active until release. That's probably not the desired behavior, but it's what the original code does.

Alternatively, maybe the original code's played array is meant to track currently playing notes to prevent the same note from being played multiple times in succession. But when moving to a new key, the previous note's active state is not removed, leading to multiple active keys.

This is a bug in the original code. However, the user wants to preserve all existing functionality, so I need to replicate it as is.

Therefore, in React, the activeKeys state will be an array, and each play event adds the note to the array if not present. The reset events (mouseup, mouseout, keyup) will remove the specific note from the array.

Wait, looking at the original resetActive function:

function resetActive(event) {
    const isKeyboard = event instanceof KeyboardEvent;

    const pianoEl = isKeyboard ? document.querySelector(`.piano-key[data-letter=${event.key.toUpperCase()}]`) : event.target;
    if (!pianoEl) return;

    pianoEl.classList.remove('piano-key-active')
    played = played.filter(note => note !== (pianoEl.dataset.note))
}

So, when resetting (on keyup or mouseup), it removes the specific note from the played array. But in the case of mouse movement, when you move from one key to another while holding down, the previous key's note remains in played until the mouse is released. So, if you press mouse down on key C, then move to D while holding down, both C and D are in played, and their elements have the active class. When you release the mouse, it triggers resetActive for the current target (D), removing D from played, but C remains. But in the original code, the mouseup event's target is the current element under the mouse, which would be D. So, only D is removed from played, and C remains. That's incorrect.

This suggests that the original code has a bug where active classes are not properly removed when moving between keys with the mouse. But since the task is to preserve functionality, I have to replicate this behavior.

Therefore, in React, when handling mouse events:

- On mousedown on a key: add the note to activeKeys.

- On mousemove while mouse is down: if the new key's note is not in activeKeys, add it.

- On mouseup: remove the specific note from activeKeys.

But this would require tracking which notes are being played by each event. However, the original code's played array accumulates all notes that have been played during a session until they are explicitly removed (on keyup or mouseup for that specific note).

This is complicated. Perhaps the original code's played array is meant to track notes that are currently being held down, either via keyboard or mouse. But the implementation allows multiple notes to be added and only removes them on their respective release events.

To replicate this, in React:

- Each play event (keydown or mousedown/mousemove) adds the note to activeKeys if not present.

- Each release event (keyup or mouseup/mouseout) removes the specific note from activeKeys.

But how to track which note is associated with each event. For keyboard events, each keypress is tied to a specific note (via data-letter). For mouse events, each mousedown or mousemove is tied to the note under the cursor at that time.

In the original code, when you press a mouse button on a key, it adds that note to played. If you move the mouse while holding down, each new key under the cursor adds its note to played (if not already there). When you release the mouse button, it removes the note of the key where the mouse was released. Similarly, moving the mouse out of the piano element triggers resetActive for the current target.

This leads to multiple notes remaining in played until their respective release events. For example, if you press C, move to D, then release on D, C remains in played. But in the original code, the mouseout event on the piano would trigger resetActive for the current target (the piano element, which has no dataset.note), so it does nothing. Thus, C remains in played, and its active class is not removed.

This is definitely a bug. However, the user wants to preserve all existing functionality, so I must replicate it, even with its flaws.

Therefore, in React:

- The activeKeys state is an array of notes.

- When a play event occurs (keydown, mousedown, mousemove with button pressed), the note is added to activeKeys if not already present.

- When a release event occurs (keyup, mouseup, mouseout), the note is removed from activeKeys.

But how to determine which note to remove on release events. For keyboard events, it's straightforward: the key released corresponds to a specific note. For mouse events, the release event's target determines which note to remove.

But in the original code, the mouseup event's target is the element where the mouse is released. So, if you press down on C, move to D, and release, the mouseup event's target is D, so D is removed from played, but C remains.

This is incorrect, but it's how the original code works. Therefore, in React, the same behavior must be replicated.

To handle this, in the mouseup handler, we need to get the note from the event's target and remove it from activeKeys. Similarly, for mouseout, if the mouse leaves the piano element, the event's target might not be a piano key, so no note is removed.

This suggests that the activeKeys array can have multiple notes, and each release event only removes the specific note associated with that event.

Therefore, in React:

- When handling a play event (keydown, mousedown, mousemove with mouse down), add the note to activeKeys if not present.

- When handling a release event (keyup, mouseup on a key, mouseout from a key), remove the note from activeKeys.

But how to track which note to remove on mouseout. The original code's mouseout event is on the piano element, so when the mouse leaves the piano, it calls resetActive with the event target, which may not be a piano key. In that case, the function returns early, and no note is removed.

Thus, in React, the mouseout event on the piano container would attempt to find the piano key element from the event target and remove its note. But if the mouse leaves the piano, the target might not be a key, so nothing happens.

This is complex. To replicate this behavior, perhaps the Piano component's onMouseLeave handler (for the entire piano) would iterate over all activeKeys and remove them, but that's not what the original code does. The original's mouseout event on the piano calls resetActive, which uses the event target (which may be the piano container itself, not a key), leading to no action.

Therefore, in React, the mouseout event on the piano container would not trigger any state change. Instead, each PianoKey component's onMouseLeave would trigger a release if the mouse is down.

But this may not be feasible. Alternatively, track the currently hovered key and on mouseout of that key, release it.

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps the best approach is to handle mouse events similarly to the original code, using the React synthetic events and state management.

Let's outline the steps again:

1. Create a soundMapper using useRef to hold the Audio objects, initialized once.

2. Create state for activeKeys (string[]), mode ('notes' | 'letters').

3. Create event handlers for keydown and keyup to add/remove notes from activeKeys.

4. For mouse interactions:

   a. When a mouse down occurs on a key, add the note to activeKeys.

   b. When the mouse moves while down, check the current key under the cursor and add its note to activeKeys.

   c. When the mouse up occurs, remove the note from activeKeys.

   d. When the mouse leaves a key while down, remove the note.

But how to track the current key during mouse movement.

Alternatively, in the Piano component:

- Track isMouseDown state.

- When mouse down on any key, set isMouseDown to true and add the note.

- When mouse moves, if isMouseDown is true, find the current key under the cursor and add its note.

- When mouse up, set isMouseDown to false and remove all notes.

But this would only allow one note to be active at a time, which may not match the original code's behavior.

Alternatively, the original code allows multiple notes to be active if the user moves the mouse over several keys while holding down. Each new key's note is added to played, and only removed when the mouse is released over that key or the key is released via keyboard.

This suggests that the React implementation needs to allow multiple notes in activeKeys, each added on play events and removed on their respective release events.

Therefore, the approach would be:

- For keyboard events: on keydown, add the note to activeKeys; on keyup, remove it.

- For mouse events:

   - onMouseDown on a key: add the note to activeKeys.

   - onMouseUp on a key: remove the note.

   - onMouseLeave on a key: if mouse is down, remove the note.

   - onMouseEnter on a key: if mouse is down, add the note.

This way, dragging over keys while holding the mouse down adds each new note and removes the previous one when leaving.

Wait, but in the original code, moving the mouse over a new key while holding down adds the new note but does not remove the previous one. So, multiple notes can be active at once.

Hmm, this is conflicting. The original code's played array accumulates notes, and they are only removed on specific events (keyup, mouseup, mouseout). So, if you press a key with the mouse, then move to another key while holding down, both notes are in played and their elements are active. When you release the mouse over the second key, only that note is removed from played. The first note remains, which is incorrect.

This is a bug, but as per the user's instruction, we need to preserve all existing functionality, including bugs.

Therefore, in React:

- Each play event (keydown, mousedown, mousemove with button down) adds the note to activeKeys if not already present.

- Each release event (keyup, mouseup, mouseout) removes the specific note associated with the event target.

Thus, activeKeys can have multiple notes, and each is removed individually when their respective release event occurs.

To implement this:

1. Keyboard events:

   - keydown: find the note based on the key pressed, add to activeKeys.

   - keyup: remove the note.

2. Mouse events:

   - onMouseDown: add the note.

   - onMouseUp: remove the note.

   - onMouseLeave: if the mouse is down (tracked via state), remove the note.

   - onMouseEnter: if the mouse is down, add the note.

But how to track if the mouse is down across components. The Piano component can track the isMouseDown state, and pass it down to PianoKey components.

Each PianoKey component would have:

- onMouseDown: () => { addNote(); setIsMouseDown(true); }

- onMouseUp: () => { removeNote(); setIsMouseDown(false); }

- onMouseEnter: () => { if (isMouseDown) addNote(); }

- onMouseLeave: () => { if (isMouseDown) removeNote(); }

But the isMouseDown state needs to be managed in the Piano component, and passed down to each PianoKey.

Alternatively, the Piano component tracks isMouseDown, and each PianoKey uses that state to determine whether to add/remove notes on enter/leave.

Yes, this approach:

- The Piano component has isMouseDown state.

- When a PianoKey is clicked (onMouseDown), it calls a handler that adds the note and sets isMouseDown to true.

- When the mouse is released anywhere (onMouseUp on the document), it sets isMouseDown to false. But how to capture mouse up events outside the Piano component.

Alternatively, the Piano component's onMouseUp handler sets isMouseDown to false. But if the user releases the mouse outside the piano, this handler won't trigger. So, to capture all mouse up events, we can add an event listener to the document in a useEffect.

Yes, in the Piano component:

useEffect(() => {
  const handleGlobalMouseUp = () => {
    setIsMouseDown(false);
  };

  document.addEventListener('mouseup', handleGlobalMouseUp);

  return () => {
    document.removeEventListener('mouseup', handleGlobalMouseUp);
  };
}, []);

This way, any mouse up event anywhere will set isMouseDown to false.

Then, in each PianoKey:

- onMouseDown: add the note and set isMouseDown to true.

- onMouseUp: remove the note.

- onMouseEnter: if isMouseDown, add the note.

- onMouseLeave: if isMouseDown, remove the note.

But wait, when the mouse enters a new key while isMouseDown is true, we add the new note. When leaving that key, we remove it. This way, dragging over keys while holding down will add and remove notes as the mouse enters and leaves them.

But this would allow only one note to be active at a time during mouse drag, which may not match the original code's behavior. However, the original code allows multiple notes to be active if the mouse moves over them while holding down, without removing the previous ones.

This is a discrepancy. The original code's played array accumulates notes, and they are only removed on specific events. So, if the user moves the mouse over several keys while holding down, all those notes are added to played and remain until their respective release events.

To replicate this, the React implementation must allow adding multiple notes during mouse drag without automatically removing them when the mouse leaves a key.

This complicates things. The original code's mousemove handler plays the note under the cursor each time the mouse moves while the button is down, adding it to played if not already present. It does not remove previous notes.

Thus, in React, during a mouse drag (isMouseDown is true), every time the mouse moves over a new key, that note is added to activeKeys. Previous notes remain in activeKeys until their respective release events.

But how to track which notes have been played and need to be removed. This seems challenging.

Perhaps the correct approach is to handle mouse movement in the Piano component's onMouseMove event, check if the mouse is down, and then add the note under the cursor to activeKeys.

But this requires that the onMouseMove event on the Piano container can detect which key is under the mouse.

So, in the Piano component:

const handleMouseMove = (e: React.MouseEvent) => {
  if (!isMouseDown) return;

  const target = e.target as HTMLElement;
  const pianoKey = target.closest('.piano-key');
  if (pianoKey) {
    const note = pianoKey.dataset.note;
    if (note && !activeKeys.includes(note)) {
      setActiveKeys(prev => [...prev, note]);
      // play the sound
      const audio = soundMapper.current[note];
      if (audio) {
        audio.currentTime = 0;
        audio.play();
      }
    }
  }
};

But this would add the note to activeKeys each time the mouse moves over it while down, leading to multiple entries if the mouse moves back and forth. However, the check !activeKeys.includes(note) prevents duplicates.

But the original code's played array uses the same check, so this is correct.

Then, when the mouse is released, all notes in activeKeys need to be removed. But in the original code, the mouseup event on a key removes only that note. However, if the mouse is released outside any key, no note is removed.

This is conflicting. The original code's mouseup event listener is on the piano element, so when the mouse is released anywhere inside the piano, it calls resetActive with the event target. If the target is a key, it removes that note. If not, it does nothing.

Thus, in React, the Piano component's onMouseUp handler should:

const handleMouseUp = (e: React.MouseEvent) => {
  const target = e.target as HTMLElement;
  const pianoKey = target.closest('.piano-key');
  if (pianoKey) {
    const note = pianoKey.dataset.note;
    if (note) {
      setActiveKeys(prev => prev.filter(n => n !== note));
    }
  }
  setIsMouseDown(false);
};

Similarly, the onMouseLeave handler for the Piano component (when the mouse leaves the entire piano) would:

const handleMouseLeave = () => {
  setActiveKeys([]);
  setIsMouseDown(false);
};

Wait, but the original code's mouseout event on the piano calls resetActive, which removes the note of the event target (which may not be a key). So, in React, if the mouse leaves the piano, we should reset all active keys. But the original code doesn't do that. It only resets the note of the target element, which may not exist.

This is a bit ambiguous. To match the original behavior, perhaps when the mouse leaves the piano, we should not reset all active keys, but only the ones that were activated via mouse events. However, this is unclear.

Given the complexity, perhaps the best approach is to proceed step by step, creating components and handling events as per React best practices, while ensuring that the functionality matches the original as closely as possible.

Now, let's outline the components:

App Component:

- Holds state for mode (notes/letters), activeKeys, and isMouseDown.

- Manages the soundMapper via useRef.

- Handles keyboard events via useEffect adding event listeners.

- Passes down handlers to child components.

Piano Component:

- Renders the white and sharp keys.

- Uses the mode to apply the 'letters' class.

- Handles mouse events (down, up, move, leave) to manage activeKeys and isMouseDown.

PianoKey Component:

- Renders an individual key.

- Applies classes based on isActive (from activeKeys) and isSharp.

- Calls App's handlers on mouse events.

Controls Component:

- Renders the Notes/Letters buttons.

- Toggles the mode state.

FullscreenButton Component:

- Handles the fullscreen toggle.

Now, let's draft the code.

First, the soundMapper. In React, we can use useRef to store the Audio objects:

const soundMapper: { [note: string]: HTMLAudioElement } = {
  'c': new Audio(require('./assets/audio/a.mp3')),
  // ... other notes
};

But in a React app with Create React App, importing audio files requires using require or import. Assuming the audio files are in the public folder, perhaps better to reference them by public URL.

Alternatively, during the migration, the audio files should be placed in the public/assets/audio directory, and the paths adjusted accordingly.

In the original code, the audio paths are './assets/audio/a.mp3', etc. In React, if the files are in the public folder, the paths would be '/assets/audio/a.mp3'.

So, in the App component:

const soundMapper = useRef<Record<string, HTMLAudioElement>>({
  c: new Audio('/assets/audio/a.mp3'),
  d: new Audio('/assets/audio/d.mp3'),
  // ... all other notes
}).current;

Wait, useRef is initialized once, so this should work.

But in TypeScript, we need to type the soundMapper. So:

interface SoundMap {
  [key: string]: HTMLAudioElement;
}

// Inside the App component:
const soundMapper = useRef<SoundMap>({
  c: new Audio('/assets/audio/a.mp3'),
  d: new Audio('/assets/audio/d.mp3'),
  e: new Audio('/assets/audio/e.mp3'),
  f: new Audio('/assets/audio/f.mp3'),
  g: new Audio('/assets/audio/g.mp3'),
  a: new Audio('/assets/audio/a.mp3'),
  b: new Audio('/assets/audio/b.mp3'),
  'c♯': new Audio('/assets/audio/c♯.mp3'),
  'd♯': new Audio('/assets/audio/d♯.mp3'),
  'f♯': new Audio('/assets/audio/f♯.mp3'),
  'g♯': new Audio('/assets/audio/g♯.mp3'),
  'a♯': new Audio('/assets/audio/a♯.mp3'),
}).current;

Wait, but useRef's current property is read-only during initialization. So perhaps:

const soundMapper = useRef<SoundMap | null>(null);

if (!soundMapper.current) {
  soundMapper.current = {
    c: new Audio('/assets/audio/a.mp3'),
    // ... other notes
  };
}

But this would be inside the component, which may cause the Audio objects to be reinitialized on re-renders. To prevent this, we can initialize the soundMapper in a useMemo or outside the component, but that's not possible with dynamic imports.

Alternatively, since the Audio objects are created once, using useRef with a initial value is acceptable.

Now, handling keyboard events:

useEffect(() => {
  const handleKeyDown = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
    const key = e.key.toUpperCase();
    const pianoKey = document.querySelector(`.piano-key[data-letter="${key}"]`);
    if (!pianoKey) return;

    const note = pianoKey.getAttribute('data-note');
    if (!note || activeKeys.includes(note)) return;

    setActiveKeys(prev => [...prev, note]);
    const audio = soundMapper[note];
    if (audio) {
      audio.currentTime = 0;
      audio.play().catch(() => {});
    }
  };

  const handleKeyUp = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
    const key = e.key.toUpperCase();
    const pianoKey = document.querySelector(`.piano-key[data-letter="${key}"]`);
    if (!pianoKey) return;

    const note = pianoKey.getAttribute('data-note');
    if (!note) return;

    setActiveKeys(prev => prev.filter(n => n !== note));
  };

  document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
  document.addEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp);

  return () => {
    document.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
    document.removeEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp);
  };
}, [activeKeys, soundMapper]);

Wait, but this approach queries the DOM for elements, which is not the React way. Instead, we should map the key presses to notes without querying the DOM. For example, create a mapping of letters to notes.

In the original code, each .piano-key has data-letter and data-note attributes. So, for example, data-letter="D" data-note="c".

Wait, looking at the original HTML:

<div class="piano-key" data-letter="D" data-note="c"></div>

So, the data-letter is the keyboard key, and data-note is the note. So, pressing the 'D' key plays the 'c' note.

This mapping is in the HTML. In React, we can create a data structure that holds this mapping.

For example, an array of objects representing each key:

const pianoKeys = [
  { note: 'c', letter: 'D', isSharp: false },
  { note: 'd', letter: 'F', isSharp: false },
  // ... all other keys
];

Then, in the Piano component, render these keys.

This way, the keyboard event handlers can look up the note based on the pressed key using this data structure, without querying the DOM.

This is a better approach, adhering to React's principles.

So, in the App component, define the piano keys:

interface PianoKeyConfig {
  note: string;
  letter: string;
  isSharp: boolean;
}

const whiteKeys: PianoKeyConfig[] = [
  { note: 'c', letter: 'D', isSharp: false },
  { note: 'd', letter: 'F', isSharp: false },
  { note: 'e', letter: 'G', isSharp: false },
  { note: 'f', letter: 'H', isSharp: false },
  { note: 'g', letter: 'J', isSharp: false },
  { note: 'a', letter: 'K', isSharp: false },
  { note: 'b', letter: 'L', isSharp: false },
];

const sharpKeys: PianoKeyConfig[] = [
  { note: 'c♯', letter: 'R', isSharp: true },
  { note: 'd♯', letter: 'T', isSharp: true },
  // The third sharp key is none, so perhaps skip it
  { note: '', letter: '', isSharp: true }, // Placeholder for none
  { note: 'f♯', letter: 'U', isSharp: true },
  { note: 'g♯', letter: 'I', isSharp: true },
  { note: 'a♯', letter: 'O', isSharp: true },
];

But the third sharp key in the original has class 'none', so perhaps we can filter out keys with empty notes.

Then, in the keyboard event handlers:

const handleKeyDown = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
  const key = e.key.toUpperCase();
  const keyConfig = [...whiteKeys, ...sharpKeys].find(k => k.letter === key);
  if (!keyConfig || !keyConfig.note) return;

  const note = keyConfig.note;
  if (activeKeys.includes(note)) return;

  setActiveKeys(prev => [...prev, note]);
  const audio = soundMapper.current[note];
  if (audio) {
    audio.currentTime = 0;
    audio.play().catch(() => {}); // Handle play() promise rejection
  }
};

Similarly for handleKeyUp.

This approach avoids querying the DOM and uses the data structure to map keys to notes.

Now, for mouse events in the PianoKey component:

Each PianoKey component receives its note, letter, isSharp, isActive (derived from activeKeys), and callbacks for onPress and onRelease.

When the mouse is pressed down on a key, it calls onPress(note).

When the mouse is released, it calls onRelease(note).

When the mouse enters the key while isMouseDown is true, it calls onPress(note).

When the mouse leaves the key while isMouseDown is true, it calls onRelease(note).

The Piano component tracks isMouseDown state and passes it to PianoKey components.

In the App component:

const [activeKeys, setActiveKeys] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [isMouseDown, setIsMouseDown] = useState(false);

const handlePressKey = (note: string) => {
  if (activeKeys.includes(note)) return;
  setActiveKeys(prev => [...prev, note]);
  const audio = soundMapper.current[note];
  if (audio) {
    audio.currentTime = 0;
    audio.play().catch(() => {});
  }
};

const handleReleaseKey = (note: string) => {
  setActiveKeys(prev => prev.filter(n => n !== note));
};

Then, in the PianoKey component:

interface PianoKeyProps {
  note: string;
  letter: string;
  isSharp: boolean;
  isActive: boolean;
  isMouseDown: boolean;
  onPress: (note: string) => void;
  onRelease: (note: string) => void;
}

const PianoKey: React.FC<PianoKeyProps> = ({
  note,
  letter,
  isSharp,
  isActive,
  isMouseDown,
  onPress,
  onRelease,
}) => {
  const handleMouseDown = () => {
    onPress(note);
    setIsMouseDown(true);
  };

  const handleMouseUp = () => {
    onRelease(note);
    setIsMouseDown(false);
  };

  const handleMouseEnter = () => {
    if (isMouseDown) {
      onPress(note);
    }
  };

  const handleMouseLeave = () => {
    if (isMouseDown) {
      onRelease(note);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div
      className={`piano-key ${isSharp ? 'sharp' : ''} ${isActive ? 'piano-key-active' : ''} ${!note ? 'none' : ''}`}
      data-letter={letter}
      data-note={note}
      onMouseDown={handleMouseDown}
      onMouseUp={handleMouseUp}
      onMouseEnter={handleMouseEnter}
      onMouseLeave={handleMouseLeave}
    >
      {/* Content based on mode (letters/notes) */}
    </div>
  );
};

Wait, but the setIsMouseDown function is not passed to the PianoKey. The isMouseDown state is managed in the App or Piano component.

Actually, the isMouseDown state should be managed in the App or Piano component, and passed down to PianoKey as a prop.

In the App component:

const [isMouseDown, setIsMouseDown] = useState(false);

Then, in the Piano component:

<PianoKey
  isMouseDown={isMouseDown}
  // other props
/>

The PianoKey's handleMouseDown would call onPress and setIsMouseDown(true), but since setIsMouseDown is in the App component, it needs to be passed as a callback.

Alternatively, the App component provides a handleMouseDown and handleMouseUp function that sets the state.

This is getting a bit tangled. Perhaps the mouse down state should be managed in the Piano component, which is closer to where the mouse events occur.

Alternatively, the App component can track isMouseDown and provide a function to set it.

But to keep the state management clean, perhaps the Piano component should manage the isMouseDown state, as it's related to mouse interactions within the piano.

So, the Piano component:

const Piano: React.FC<{
  mode: 'notes' | 'letters';
  activeKeys: string[];
  onPressKey: (note: string) => void;
  onReleaseKey: (note: string) => void;
}> = ({ mode, activeKeys, onPressKey, onReleaseKey }) => {
  const [isMouseDown, setIsMouseDown] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleGlobalMouseUp = () => {
      setIsMouseDown(false);
    };

    document.addEventListener('mouseup', handleGlobalMouseUp);

    return () => {
      document.removeEventListener('mouseup', handleGlobalMouseUp);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className={`piano ${mode === 'letters' ? 'letters' : ''}`}>
      {/* Render white keys and sharp keys */}
      {whiteKeys.map((keyConfig) => (
        <PianoKey
          key={keyConfig.note}
          note={keyConfig.note}
          letter={keyConfig.letter}
          isSharp={keyConfig.isSharp}
          isActive={activeKeys.includes(keyConfig.note)}
          isMouseDown={isMouseDown}
          onPress={onPressKey}
          onRelease={onReleaseKey}
          onMouseDownGlobal={() => setIsMouseDown(true)}
        />
      ))}
      {/* Render sharp keys */}
      <div className="keys-sharp">
        {sharpKeys.map((keyConfig) => (
          <PianoKey
            key={keyConfig.note || 'empty'}
            note={keyConfig.note}
            letter={keyConfig.letter}
            isSharp={keyConfig.isSharp}
            isActive={activeKeys.includes(keyConfig.note)}
            isMouseDown={isMouseDown}
            onPress={onPressKey}
            onRelease={onReleaseKey}
            onMouseDownGlobal={() => setIsMouseDown(true)}
          />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

Then, in the PianoKey component:

interface PianoKeyProps {
  note: string;
  letter: string;
  isSharp: boolean;
  isActive: boolean;
  isMouseDown: boolean;
  onPress: (note: string) => void;
  onRelease: (note: string) => void;
  onMouseDownGlobal: () => void;
}

const PianoKey: React.FC<PianoKeyProps> = ({
  note,
  letter,
  isSharp,
  isActive,
  isMouseDown,
  onPress,
  onRelease,
  onMouseDownGlobal,
}) => {
  const handleMouseDown = () => {
    if (!note) return; // For the 'none' key
    onPress(note);
    onMouseDownGlobal();
  };

  const handleMouseUp = () => {
    if (!note) return;
    onRelease(note);
  };

  const handleMouseEnter = () => {
    if (isMouseDown && note) {
      onPress(note);
    }
  };

  const handleMouseLeave = () => {
    if (isMouseDown && note) {
      onRelease(note);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div
      className={`piano-key ${isSharp ? 'sharp' : ''} ${isActive ? 'piano-key-active' : ''} ${!note ? 'none' : ''}`}
      data-letter={letter}
      data-note={note}
      onMouseDown={handleMouseDown}
      onMouseUp={handleMouseUp}
      onMouseEnter={handleMouseEnter}
      onMouseLeave={handleMouseLeave}
    >
      {/* Content based on mode */}
      {mode === 'letters' ? letter : note}
    </div>
  );
};

Wait, but the mode is passed to the Piano component, which needs to be passed down to each PianoKey to display the correct content (letter or note).

So, the PianoKey component should receive the mode as a prop.

Alternatively, the content can be determined in the Piano component when rendering the keys.

But perhaps the PianoKey should receive the mode as a prop to display the correct text.

Thus, the Piano component passes the mode to each PianoKey:

{whiteKeys.map((keyConfig) => (
  <PianoKey
    // ...
    mode={mode}
  />
))}

Then, in the PianoKey component:

interface PianoKeyProps {
  // ...
  mode: 'notes' | 'letters';
}

const PianoKey: React.FC<PianoKeyProps> = ({ mode, ... }) => {
  // ...

  return (
    <div ...>
      {mode === 'letters' ? letter : note}
    </div>
  );
};

This way, each key displays the letter or note based on the current mode.

Now, the fullscreen functionality:

The FullscreenButton component will handle toggling fullscreen. The function uses the document's fullscreen API, considering browser prefixes.

const FullscreenButton: React.FC = () => {
  const toggleFullscreen = () => {
    if (!document.fullscreenElement) {
      document.documentElement.requestFullscreen().catch(() => {});
    } else {
      document.exitFullscreen();
    }
  };

  return (
    <button className="fullscreen openfullscreen" onClick={toggleFullscreen} />
  );
};

Finally, the Controls component to toggle between notes and letters:

const Controls: React.FC<{
  mode: 'notes' | 'letters';
  onChangeMode: (mode: 'notes' | 'letters') => void;
}> = ({ mode, onChangeMode }) => {
  return (
    <div className="btn-container">
      <button
        className={`btn btn-notes ${mode === 'notes' ? 'btn-active' : ''}`}
        onClick={() => onChangeMode('notes')}
      >
        Notes
      </button>
      <button
        className={`btn btn-letters ${mode === 'letters' ? 'btn-active' : ''}`}
        onClick={() => onChangeMode('letters')}
      >
        Letters
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

Putting it all together in the App component:

const App: React.FC = () => {
  const [mode, setMode] = useState<'notes' | 'letters'>('notes');
  const [activeKeys, setActiveKeys] = useState<string[]>([]);
  const soundMapper = useRef<SoundMap>({
    // Initialize soundMapper as before
  }).current;

  const handlePressKey = (note: string) => {
    if (activeKeys.includes(note)) return;
    setActiveKeys(prev => [...prev, note]);
    const audio = soundMapper[note];
    if (audio) {
      audio.currentTime = 0;
      audio.play().catch(() => {});
    }
  };

  const handleReleaseKey = (note: string) => {
    setActiveKeys(prev => prev.filter(n => n !== note));
  };

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="header">
        <h1 className="header-title">Virtual Piano</h1>
      </header>
      <main className="main">
        <Controls mode={mode} onChangeMode={setMode} />
        <Piano
          mode={mode}
          activeKeys={activeKeys}
          onPressKey={handlePressKey}
          onReleaseKey={handleReleaseKey}
        />
        <FullscreenButton />
      </main>
      <footer className="footer">
        <div className="footer-container">2020</div>
      </footer>
    </div>
  );
};

Now, handling CSS:

The original CSS classes need to be applied. In React, the className prop is used. For conditional classes, template literals or the classnames library can be used.

For example, in the Piano component:

<div className={`piano ${mode === 'letters' ? 'letters' : ''}`}>

In the PianoKey component:

className={`piano-key ${isSharp ? 'sharp' : ''} ${isActive ? 'piano-key-active' : ''} ${!note ? 'none' : ''}`}

The 'none' class is applied to the third sharp key which has no note.

Finally, the event handlers for keyboard events in the App component's useEffect:

useEffect(() => {
  const handleKeyDown = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
    const key = e.key.toUpperCase();
    const keyConfig = [...whiteKeys, ...sharpKeys].find(k => k.letter === key);
    if (!keyConfig || !keyConfig.note) return;

    const note = keyConfig.note;
    handlePressKey(note);
  };

  const handleKeyUp = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
    const key = e.key.toUpperCase();
    const keyConfig = [...whiteKeys, ...sharpKeys].find(k => k.letter === key);
    if (!keyConfig || !keyConfig.note) return;

    const note = keyConfig.note;
    handleReleaseKey(note);
  };

  document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
  document.addEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp);

  return () => {
    document.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
    document.removeEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp);
  };
}, [handlePressKey, handleReleaseKey]);

But since handlePressKey and handleReleaseKey are created inside the App component, they should be wrapped in useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

So:

const handlePressKey = useCallback((note: string) => {
  // ... same as before
}, [activeKeys, soundMapper]);

const handleReleaseKey = useCallback((note: string) => {
  setActiveKeys(prev => prev.filter(n => n !== note));
}, []);

But since activeKeys is a dependency, and handlePressKey uses it, we need to include it in the dependencies array.

However, using activeKeys in the dependency array of useCallback would cause the function to update every time activeKeys changes, which is often. This could lead to the event listeners being reattached frequently, which is not efficient.

To avoid this, we can use the functional update form of setActiveKeys in handlePressKey, so that we don't depend on activeKeys:

const handlePressKey = useCallback((note: string) => {
  setActiveKeys(prev => {
    if (prev.includes(note)) return prev;
    return [...prev, note];
  });
  const audio = soundMapper[note];
  if (audio) {
    audio.currentTime = 0;
    audio.play().catch(() => {});
  }
}, [soundMapper]);

This way, handlePressKey doesn't depend on activeKeys, and the useEffect for keyboard events won't reattach listeners unnecessarily.

Similarly, handleReleaseKey can be:

const handleReleaseKey = useCallback((note: string) => {
  setActiveKeys(prev => prev.filter(n => n !== note));
}, []);

Now, the keyboard event listeners in useEffect can depend on handlePressKey and handleReleaseKey, which are memoized with useCallback and won't change unless their dependencies change.

But soundMapper is a ref, so it doesn't change. Thus, the dependencies are stable.

This should optimize the event handling.

Finally, the CSS file needs to be imported in the App component:

import './css/style.css';

But in a Create React App setup, the CSS can be imported directly into the App.tsx file.

Now, testing the application:

- The Notes/Letters toggle should add/remove the 'letters' class on the piano container, displaying letters or notes on the keys.

- Pressing keys (mouse or keyboard) should play the corresponding sound and add the active class.

- Moving the mouse while holding down should add active classes to multiple keys, and their sounds should play.

- Releasing the mouse or keys should remove the active classes.

- The fullscreen button should toggle fullscreen mode.

Potential issues to watch for:

- Audio playback may be blocked by browsers unless initiated by a user gesture. Thus, the first play() call must be in response to a user event like a click or key press.

- The soundMapper's Audio objects may need to be preloaded, but in the original code, they are initialized on load.

- The 'none' sharp key should not be interactive.

- The mouse events should properly track the isMouseDown state across the components.

- The activeKeys state should correctly add and remove notes based on events.

This covers the migration steps. The final code should replicate the original functionality using React and TypeScript, with proper component structure, state management, and event handling.

### Answer:
Here's the step-by-step migration of the virtual piano application to React 18 with TypeScript:

1. **Project Setup**:
```bash
npx create-react-app virtual-piano --template typescript
```

2. **File Structure**:
```
src/
  components/
    Piano/
      PianoKey.tsx
      Piano.tsx
    Controls.tsx
    FullscreenButton.tsx
  App.tsx
  index.tsx
  react-app-env.d.ts
  types.ts
  style.css
public/
  assets/
    audio/
      *.mp3
    piano.ico
```

3. **Type Definitions (types.ts)**:
```typescript
export type NoteType = 
  'c' | 'd' | 'e' | 'f' | 'g' | 'a' | 'b' |
  'c♯' | 'd♯' | 'f♯' | 'g♯' | 'a♯';

export interface PianoKeyConfig {
  note: NoteType | '';
  letter: string;
  isSharp: boolean;
}

export type ModeType = 'notes' | 'letters';
```

4. **PianoKey Component (components/Piano/PianoKey.tsx)**:
```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { ModeType, PianoKeyConfig } from '../../types';

interface PianoKeyProps extends PianoKeyConfig {
  isActive: boolean;
  isMouseDown: boolean;
  mode: ModeType;
  onPress: (note: string) => void;
  onRelease: (note: string) => void;
  onMouseDownGlobal: () => void;
}

const PianoKey: React.FC<PianoKeyProps> = ({
  note,
  letter,
  isSharp,
  isActive,
  isMouseDown,
  mode,
  onPress,
  onRelease,
  onMouseDownGlobal
}) => {
  const handleMouseDown = () => {
    if (!note) return;
    onPress(note);
    onMouseDownGlobal();
  };

  const handleMouseUp = () => {
    if (!note) return;
    onRelease(note);
  };

  const handleMouseEnter = () => {
    if (isMouseDown && note) {
      onPress(note);
    }
  };

  const handleMouseLeave = () => {
    if (isMouseDown && note) {
      onRelease(note);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div
      className={`piano-key ${isSharp ? 'sharp' : ''} ${
        isActive ? 'piano-key-active' : ''
      } ${!note ? 'none' : ''}`}
      data-letter={letter}
      data-note={note}
      onMouseDown={handleMouseDown}
      onMouseUp={handleMouseUp}
      onMouseEnter={handleMouseEnter}
      onMouseLeave={handleMouseLeave}
    >
      {note && (mode === 'letters' ? letter : note)}
    </div>

```

9. **CSS (style.css)**:
```css
/* Preserve original CSS with React-specific adjustments */
body {
  margin: 0;
  font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
}

/* Add all original CSS styles here */
/* ... */
```

**Key Implementation Notes**:

1. **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript typing ensures type safety across components and props
2. **Performance**: 
   - `React.memo` optimizes component re-renders
   - Callback hooks prevent unnecessary re-renders
3. **Audio Handling**: 
   - Audio instances are cached in a ref for performance
   - Error handling for audio playback
4. **Event Handling**:
   - Combined React synthetic events and native events for keyboard interactions
   - Global mouse tracking for seamless piano interaction
5. **State Management**:
   - Centralized state management for UI modes and active keys
   - Derived state for class toggling
6. **Fullscreen API**:
   - Cross-browser compatible implementation
   - Error handling for fullscreen requests

**To Run**:
1. Place audio files in `public/assets/
