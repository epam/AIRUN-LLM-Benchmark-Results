# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18.x
  
  The code imports from 'react-dom/client' and uses `ReactDOM.createRoot()`, which is a clear indication of React 18 usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript for type safety
  
  All files have .tsx extensions and use TypeScript interfaces, types, and type annotations throughout the codebase.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for state management
  
  The code uses `createSlice` from '@reduxjs/toolkit' in the todosSlice.ts file, and implements proper reducers with PayloadAction types.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm nanoid is used for generating unique IDs
  
  The code imports and uses `nanoid` from 'nanoid' in the prepare function of the addTodo reducer.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code uses functional components with hooks instead of class components
  
  All components (App, TodoItem, Header, Footer) are implemented as functional components using hooks such as useState, useRef, useEffect, useSelector, and useDispatch.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains the same routing functionality with proper route handling
  
  The application uses React Router v6 with proper route configuration, including handling for the three filter states (all, active, completed).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Redux store is properly configured with appropriate slices
  
  The store.ts file configures the Redux store with the todosReducer and includes proper TypeScript type definitions for RootState and AppDispatch.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the Redux provider is set up in the application entry point
  
  The index.tsx file wraps the application with the Redux Provider component, making the store available throughout the component tree.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for all data structures
  
  The code defines clear interfaces and types in types.ts for Todo and Filter, and uses these types consistently throughout the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows React best practices for component composition
  
  The application splits functionality into appropriate components (App, TodoItem, Header, Footer) with clear props interfaces and separation of concerns.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles keyboard events properly (Enter key for creating/updating todos, Escape key for canceling edits)
  
  The TodoItem component includes proper keyboard event handling for Enter (to submit) and Escape (to cancel editing).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application maintains local storage persistence if implemented
  
  Local storage persistence is implemented with store.subscribe in the store.ts file to save todos on state changes, and loadFromLocalStorage in todosSlice.ts to retrieve them.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  The code appears well-structured with no obvious errors, but there are a few small issues like missing imports for RootState in App.tsx and missing export for TodoItem component. I can't verify it's entirely free of runtime errors without execution.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify the application implements proper error handling
  
  Basic error handling is present for user interactions, but comprehensive error boundaries or API failure handling isn't explicitly shown in the provided code snippets.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm the code is optimized with no unnecessary re-renders
  
  The code uses proper Redux selector patterns with createSelector for memoization, but without a full analysis of all component renders, I can't verify with 100% confidence that there are no unnecessary re-renders.
