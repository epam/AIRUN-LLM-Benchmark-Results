# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos
   
   The application includes a `Header` component with an `<h1>todos</h1>` title and an input field with the class "new-todo" and placeholder "What needs to be done?".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos
   
   The application includes a main section with the class "main" containing a toggle-all checkbox and a todo list (`<ul className="todo-list">`).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button
   
   Each `TodoItem` component includes a toggle checkbox (`<input className="toggle">`), a label for the title, and a delete button (`<button className="destroy">`).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode
   
   The todo label has an `onDoubleClick` event handler that sets the editing state to true: `<label onDoubleClick={() => setEditing(true)}>{todo.title}</label>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)
   
   The application implements filtering using React Router with routes for "/all", "/active", and "/completed", and the filter selection is handled properly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization
   
   The `Footer` component displays the active count with proper pluralization: `<strong>{activeCount}</strong> {itemWord} left` where `itemWord` is set to either "item" or "items" based on the count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter
   
   The `Footer` component includes filter links that get the 'selected' class when they match the current filter: `className={currentFilter === 'all' ? 'selected' : ''}`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist
   
   The `Footer` component conditionally renders the "Clear completed" button only when completed todos exist: `{completedCount > 0 && (<button className="clear-completed" onClick={onClearCompleted}>Clear completed</button>)}`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter
   
   The `Header` component includes a form with an `onSubmit` handler that creates a new todo when Enter is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos
   
   The `TodoItem` component includes a toggle checkbox with an `onChange` handler that calls the `onToggle` function with the todo's ID.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once
   
   The application includes a toggle-all checkbox with an `onChange` handler that calls the `handleToggleAll` function, which dispatches the `toggleAll` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management
   
   The `TodoItem` component includes an edit input field that gets focus when editing mode is enabled using a `useEffect` hook with a `useRef`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos
   
   The `TodoItem` component includes a delete button with an `onClick` handler that calls the `onDelete` function with the todo's ID.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos
   
   The `Footer` component includes a "Clear completed" button with an `onClick` handler that calls the `onClearCompleted` function, which dispatches the `clearCompleted` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status
   
   The application uses a selector function `selectFilteredTodos` that filters todos based on the current filter and returns the appropriate subset of todos.
