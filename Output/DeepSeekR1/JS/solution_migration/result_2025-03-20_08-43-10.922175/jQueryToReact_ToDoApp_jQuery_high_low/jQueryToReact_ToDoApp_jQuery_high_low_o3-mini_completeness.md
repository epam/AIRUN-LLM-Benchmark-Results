# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos  
  The Header component clearly renders a header with an <h1> displaying "todos" and an input field with the placeholder "What needs to be done?".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos  
  The App component contains a section with the class "main" including a checkbox with id "toggle-all" and a <ul> with the class "todo-list" for displaying todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button  
  The TodoItem component includes an input of type checkbox for toggling, a label for showing the todo title, and a button with the class "destroy" to delete the todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode  
  In the TodoItem component, the <label> has an onDoubleClick handler that sets the editing state to true, enabling the edit mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The implementation includes filter links in the Footer component and uses React Router to set the current filter. The App component processes the filter parameter from the URL and applies it using the selectFilteredTodos selector.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization  
  The Footer component calculates the active todo count and correctly displays "item" or "items" based on whether the activeCount is 1 or not.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter  
  The Footer component uses <Link> elements with conditional class names (e.g., "selected") based on the currentFilter prop, ensuring the active filter is highlighted.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist  
  The Footer component conditionally renders a button with the class "clear-completed" when the completedCount (difference between the total and active todos) is greater than zero.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter  
  The Header component handles form submission on pressing Enter, calls the onSubmit prop with the trimmed todo title, and resets the input field.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos  
  Each TodoItemâ€™s checkbox onChange event calls the onToggle handler with the corresponding todo id, allowing individual toggling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once  
  The App component provides a "toggle-all" checkbox that, when triggered, dispatches the toggleAll action to update the completion status of all todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management  
  The TodoItem component uses a useEffect hook to set focus on the edit input when the editing state becomes true, ensuring proper focus management.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos  
  The TodoItem component includes a delete button that directly calls the onDelete function with the todo's id, enabling deletion of an individual todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos  
  In the App component, the Footer triggers the clearCompleted action via the onClearCompleted handler, allowing the removal of all completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status  
  The implementation uses a Redux selector (selectFilteredTodos) that applies different filtering logic based on the current filter ("all", "active", or "completed"), correctly filtering the list of todos.
