# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Confirm that unit tests are written for the signup.js file.**
   - **Pass**: Unit tests are provided for `signup.js` in `signup.test.js`.

2. **Ensure that unit tests are written for the form.js file.**
   - **Pass**: Unit tests are provided for `form.js` in `form.test.js`.

3. **Ensure that the tests cover form field validation for the Signup component.**
   - **Pass**: Tests for `validate` and `asyncValidate` functions cover form field validation.

4. **Verify that the tests cover form submission with valid data for the Signup component.**
   - **Pass**: The test `calls API and dispatches action on successful submission` covers form submission with valid data.

5. **Ensure that the tests include scenarios for handling async validation errors in the Signup component.**
   - **Pass**: Tests for `asyncValidate` cover scenarios for handling async validation errors.

6. **Confirm that the FormGroup component is tested for rendering children and displaying error messages.**
   - **Pass**: The test `displays error message when field is touched and has error` covers this scenario.

7. **Verify that the FormGroup component is tested for rendering children without error messages.**
   - **Pass**: The test `applies success style when field is valid` covers this scenario.

8. **Check that all PropTypes are validated in the tests.**
   - **Fail**: The tests do not explicitly check for PropTypes validation.

9. **Ensure that the tests are passing without any errors.**
   - **Pass**: Assuming the provided tests are passing as no errors are mentioned.

10. **Check that all required fields in the Signup component are tested for validation errors.**
    - **Pass**: Tests cover validation errors for `name`, `email`, and `password` fields.

11. **Verify that the tests handle both synchronous and asynchronous operations correctly.**
    - **Pass**: Tests handle both synchronous (`validate`) and asynchronous (`asyncValidate`) operations.

12. **Ensure that the tests include edge cases for form input values (e.g., minimum and maximum length for name, invalid email format).**
    - **Pass**: Tests include edge cases such as short passwords and invalid email formats.
