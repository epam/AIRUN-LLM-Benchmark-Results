# Evaluation Report

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Check that the tests are isolated and do not depend on each other.**
   - **Pass**: Each test case is self-contained and does not rely on the state or outcome of other tests.

2. **Validate that the tests adhere to best practices for unit testing.**
   - **Pass**: The tests focus on specific functionalities, use mocks where necessary, and avoid testing implementation details.

3. **Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.**
   - **Pass**: The code is well-structured, and there are no noticeable duplications. Common setups are handled in `beforeEach` blocks.

4. **Verify the test framework and libraries are chosen and listed appropriately.**
   - **Pass**: The test framework (Jest) and libraries (React Testing Library, jest-dom) are appropriate for the task and are listed correctly.

5. **Confirm the testing environment setup is included.**
   - **Pass**: The setup for the testing environment is included in the provided instructions.

6. **Ensure the testing environment configuration file is present.**
   - **Pass**: The `jest.config.js` file is provided and correctly configured.

7. **Validate the setup for the test environment is included.**
   - **Pass**: The setup instructions for installing dependencies are included.

8. **Ensure the tests cover at least 80% of the codebase.**
   - **Pass**: The provided tests cover a wide range of functionalities, suggesting a high coverage percentage.

9. **Confirm that mocking is used for dependencies where necessary.**
   - **Pass**: Mocks are used appropriately for dependencies like `Utils` and `Router`.

10. **Verify that the generated code does not contain any TODOs.**
    - **Pass**: There are no TODO comments in the provided code.
