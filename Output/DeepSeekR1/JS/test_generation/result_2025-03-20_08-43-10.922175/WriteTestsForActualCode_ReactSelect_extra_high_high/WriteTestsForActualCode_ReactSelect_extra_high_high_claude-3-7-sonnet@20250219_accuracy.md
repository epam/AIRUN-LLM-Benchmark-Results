# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up in the test file
  
  The test file correctly imports the necessary testing libraries:
  ```tsx
  import { render, screen, fireEvent, within } from '@testing-library/react';
  import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';
  ```
  It also properly sets up Jest for testing with appropriate mock functions and cleanup.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test cases are properly isolated and do not have interdependencies
  
  Each test is properly isolated with its own render call using the `renderSelect` helper function. Tests don't rely on state from previous tests, making them independent and reliable.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that DOM events are simulated using proper React Testing Library methods
  
  The test file uses appropriate methods for simulating DOM events:
  ```tsx
  await userEvent.click(combobox);
  await userEvent.type(listbox, '{arrowdown}');
  ```
  The code consistently uses the recommended `userEvent` API rather than the older `fireEvent` methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that accessibility attributes are being tested appropriately
  
  The code includes specific tests for accessibility attributes:
  ```tsx
  expect(combobox).toHaveAttribute('aria-haspopup', 'listbox');
  expect(combobox).toHaveAttribute('aria-expanded', 'false');
  ```
  There's a dedicated "Accessibility" section with proper WAI-ARIA compliance checks.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure mocks are used for external dependencies where appropriate
  
  The test mocks console errors appropriately:
  ```tsx
  jest.spyOn(console, 'error').mockImplementation(() => {});
  ```
  The test also correctly mocks the onChange handler using Jest's `jest.fn()`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of async/await for asynchronous testing where needed
  
  The test file consistently uses async/await with user interactions:
  ```tsx
  test('opens menu on click', async () => {
    renderSelect();
    const combobox = screen.getByRole('combobox');
    await userEvent.click(combobox);
    expect(screen.getByRole('listbox')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all assertions use appropriate Jest matchers
  
  The assertions use proper Jest matchers throughout:
  ```tsx
  expect(screen.getByRole('combobox')).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(container.firstChild).toHaveClass('custom-class');
  expect(onChange).toHaveBeenCalledWith([TEST_OPTIONS[0]], expect.any(Object));
  ```

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that tests include proper cleanup after each test case
  
  The test uses `beforeAll` and `afterAll` to set up and clean up console error mocks:
  ```tsx
  afterAll(() => {
    (console.error as jest.Mock).mockRestore();
  });
  ```
  However, it doesn't explicitly use `afterEach` for cleanup after individual tests. React Testing Library's render method automatically cleans up after each test in modern versions, but this could be made more explicit.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test descriptions clearly indicate what functionality is being tested
  
  Test descriptions are clear and descriptive:
  ```tsx
  test('selects option on click', async () => { ... });
  test('navigates options with arrow keys', async () => { ... });
  ```
  The describe blocks also provide good organization and context.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the test file follows best practices for organizing test cases (describe/it blocks)
  
  The test suite is well-organized with logical groupings:
  ```tsx
  describe('Select Component', () => {
    describe('Basic Rendering', () => { ... });
    describe('User Interactions', () => { ... });
    // ...
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that all event handlers are tested using appropriate simulation methods
  
  Event handlers are properly tested with appropriate methods:
  ```tsx
  const onChange = jest.fn();
  render
