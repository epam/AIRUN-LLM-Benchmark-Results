# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist
  
  The test suite includes a dedicated "Basic Rendering" section with tests that verify the component renders with default props, displays the default placeholder, and applies custom classNames.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present
  
  The test suite includes a "Keyboard Navigation" section that tests navigating options with arrow keys and selecting options with the enter key. There are also keyboard navigation tests in the Accessibility section.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)
  
  The "User Interactions" section includes tests for mouse interactions such as clicking to open the menu, clicking to select an option, and clicking the clear button.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior
  
  The "State Management" section includes a test for handling controlled value with `test('handles controlled value', () => {...})`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values
  
  Tests for selecting values are covered in the "User Interactions" section, and clearing values is tested with `test('clears value when clear button is clicked', async () => {...})`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented
  
  The test `test('opens menu on click', async () => {...})` in the "User Interactions" section verifies menu opening behavior.

- **Fail** (95%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality
  
  While the component is rendered with `isSearchable={true}`, there are no explicit tests for typing in the search box and verifying that options are filtered accordingly. This is a significant omission as filtering/searching is a core feature of searchable selects.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist
  
  Multi-select behavior is tested in the "State Management" section with `test('handles multi-select', async () => {...})`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility
  
  The "Accessibility" section includes tests for proper ARIA attributes and WAI-ARIA compliant keyboard navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested
  
  The "Edge Cases" section includes a test for when there are no options available: `test('shows no options message', () => {...})`.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states
  
  The "Edge Cases" section includes a test for the loading state: `test('displays loading state', () => {...})`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states
  
  The test `test('handles disabled state', () => {...})` in the "Edge Cases" section covers disabled state testing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance
  
  The "Performance" section includes a test that handles a large number of options (1000): `test('handles large number of options', async () => {...})`.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested
  
  While there are tests for keyboard navigation and selection, there aren't specific tests that verify focus management (e.g., if focus returns to the select after closing the menu, or focus behavior when tabbing through options). This is important for accessibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering
  
  The test `test('displays default placeholder', () => {...})` in the "Basic Rendering" section verifies placeholder rendering, and value rendering is verified in various tests throughout the suite.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations
  
  There are no tests for custom formatOptionLabel implementations. This is a common customization for Select components that should be tested.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)
  
  The test suite has good coverage for onChange in various scenarios. However, it lacks tests for onInputChange, onMenuOpen, and onMenuClose callbacks, which are common props for Select components.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)
