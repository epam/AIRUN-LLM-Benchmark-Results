# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist  
  The test suite includes tests under "Basic Rendering" that check for the existence of the combobox and placeholder, confirming basic rendering.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present  
  While tests for arrow keys and the enter key exist in the "Keyboard Navigation" suite, there are no tests for using the Tab or Escape keys.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)  
  The test suite covers clicking actions (e.g., opening the menu, selecting options, clearing selections). However, there is no explicit test to verify mouse hovering behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior  
  There is a dedicated test "handles controlled value" for controlled behavior and default rendering tests imply uncontrolled usage, covering both scenarios.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values  
  The suite includes tests for selecting options (e.g., clicking an option in the list) and for clearing values via the clear button, thereby covering state change scenarios.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented  
  Although there is a test for opening the menu on click, there is no explicit test verifying that the menu closes appropriately when expected (for example, on clicking outside).

- **Fail** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality  
  The component is rendered with the isSearchable prop. However, no test is provided to check the filtering or search functionality of options when the user types or interacts with the search input.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist  
  There is a specific test case for multi-select ("handles multi-select") which verifies that multiple options can be selected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility  
  The "Accessibility" describe block contains tests that check the ARIA attributes (e.g., aria-haspopup, aria-expanded, aria-selected), ensuring accessibility compliance.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested  
  The edge cases section includes a test that verifies the component correctly shows a "No options" message when an empty options array is provided.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states  
  Although a test for displaying the loading state ("displays loading state") is included, there is no test covering error states.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states  
  The test "handles disabled state" confirms that the component is disabled when the isDisabled prop is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance  
  The test "handles large number of options" checks that the component behaves correctly when provided with a large dataset.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested  
  Focus management is indirectly tested by verifying that after pressing arrow keys, the first option receives the 'option-focused' class, indicating proper focus handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering  
  Tests exist both for displaying the default placeholder text and for rendering the controlled value (e.g., ensuring "Option 1" is displayed when provided).

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations  
  There is no mention or test case verifying the behavior of a custom formatOptionLabel function, so this aspect is not covered.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)  
  While onChange is tested in several scenarios, tests for other callbacks like onInputChange, onMenuOpen, and onMenuClose are missing.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)  
  The tests verify the presence and behavior of the clear and loading indicators (with a clear button test and a "Loading..." message). However, there is no explicit test for the dropdown indicator.
