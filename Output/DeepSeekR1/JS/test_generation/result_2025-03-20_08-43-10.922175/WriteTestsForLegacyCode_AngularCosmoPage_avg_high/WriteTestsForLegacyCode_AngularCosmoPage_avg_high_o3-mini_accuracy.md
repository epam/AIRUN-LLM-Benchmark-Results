# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)  
  The tests are written using Jasmine (with Karma configured in karma.conf.js) which is a modern and widely accepted JavaScript testing framework.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints  
  Although the tests do not directly use Angular’s $resource, they effectively simulate REST API endpoints by spying on methods (e.g., REST.content.save, REST.content.update) and using $q.resolve/$q.reject to mimic asynchronous responses.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation  
  The test suite uses beforeEach extensively (e.g., module loading and dependency injection) to ensure each test starts from a clean state. No issues were observed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls  
  HTTP requests are intercepted by spy objects that return promises (using $q.resolve/$q.reject), ensuring no real API calls are made during test execution.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection  
  The tests correctly use angular.mock.module and inject to wire in dependencies such as $controller, $rootScope, $q, REST, Page, Users, $routeParams, and $translate.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations  
  The asynchronous operations are handled by resolving/rejecting promises through $q and triggering $scope.$digest() to flush promise resolutions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies  
  Multiple spies (e.g., spyOn for localStorage, $translate.instant, $location.path, and REST methods) are appropriately set up, ensuring external dependencies are mocked.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization  
  The test files make use of nested describe blocks and it statements to organize tests by functionality (Initialization, Page Operations, Form Interactions, Version Control, Error Handling, and Factories).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls  
  The test suite includes both success cases (e.g., new page creation) and error scenarios (e.g., handling save errors) to comprehensively validate behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate  
  The tests simulate user interactions by invoking functions such as titleChange(), descriptionChange(), and savePage(), and then verifying the expected outcomes.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage  
  Although there are no explicit afterEach hooks observed, the use of AngularJS’s module and injector system typically resets state between tests. This is a common, acceptable pattern in AngularJS testing, though explicit cleanup could further improve robustness.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested  
  Test case names are descriptive (e.g., "should initialize page model with default values", "should handle past schedule dates correctly"), making it clear what behavior is under test.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible  
  The tests assert expected outcomes using observable outputs (e.g., values on $scope, calls to $location.path, or broadcasted notifications) rather than inspecting internal workings, which ensures proper abstraction verification.
