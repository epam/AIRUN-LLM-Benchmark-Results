# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering
- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos
- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos
  
  The provided `app.test.tsx` doesn't include any tests for toggling all todos. There should be a test case checking the functionality of toggling all todos complete or incomplete, but this is missing from the test suite.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos
- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
  
  The `app.test.tsx` file does not contain tests for clearing completed todos. This functionality should be tested to ensure the "Clear completed" button works properly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos
- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events
  
  While the `todoItem.test.tsx` file mentions ESCAPE_KEY and ENTER_KEY imports, there are no actual tests for keyboard event handling. There should be tests verifying the behavior when these keys are pressed during editing.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts
  
  There is no `footer.test.tsx` file provided in the answer. Tests for the Footer component are completely missing.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation
  
  No footer component tests are included in the provided solution.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
  
  No footer component tests are included in the provided solution.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos
- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions
  
  While the `todoModel.test.ts` file does mock the subscribe function, it doesn't properly test the subscribe and inform functionality to ensure callbacks are being called appropriately when todos change.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations
- **Fail** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function
  
  The `utils.test.ts` file does not include tests for the extend function. Though it's mocked in the TodoModel tests, there's no direct test for this utility function.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx
- **Fail** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data
  
  The solution does not include dedicated test fixtures for todo data. Instead, it creates mock data directly within each test file. A better practice would be to have reusable fixtures.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented
