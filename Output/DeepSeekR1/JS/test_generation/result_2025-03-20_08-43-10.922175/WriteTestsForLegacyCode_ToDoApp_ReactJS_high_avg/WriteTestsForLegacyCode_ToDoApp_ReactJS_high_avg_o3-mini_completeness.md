# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering  
   The test file "app.test.tsx" includes a test ("renders header") to confirm that the TodoApp component renders as expected.

2. **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos  
   The "adds new todo" test in "app.test.tsx" simulates a key event on the todo input and verifies that model.addTodo is called.

3. **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos  
   There is no test in the TodoApp test file that targets toggling all todos. Although the TodoModel test covers toggleAll functionality, the app.tsx file is missing tests for this behavior.

4. **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos  
   The test "filters active todos" in "app.test.tsx" simulates route changes and verifies that only active todos are rendered.

5. **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
   There is no test provided in "app.test.tsx" that verifies the behavior of clearing completed todos within the TodoApp component.

6. **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering  
   The "renders todo item" test in "todoItem.test.tsx" confirms that a TodoItem is properly rendered with its title.

7. **Fail** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos  
   While toggling and editing (entering edit mode) are tested, there is no test for the destroy functionality. Therefore, this step is not fully satisfied.

8. **Fail** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events  
   There are no tests simulating or verifying the handling of keyboard events (e.g., ESCAPE_KEY or ENTER_KEY events) in "todoItem.test.tsx".

9. **Fail** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts  
   No test file for footer.tsx is present, so tests for rendering under different todo count scenarios are missing.

10. **Fail** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation  
    The provided answer does not contain a footer.tsx test file or tests verifying filter navigation.

11. **Fail** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
    There are no tests provided for footer.tsx, and no tests exist that verify the clearing completed todos functionality in the footer component.

12. **Fail** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos  
    The provided "todoModel.test.ts" includes tests for adding todos, toggling all, and clearing completed todos; however, tests for saving and destroying individual todos are missing.

13. **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions  
    The TodoModel tests subscribe a callback (mockCallback) and check that it is called after certain actions (e.g., adding a todo), thus indirectly validating the subscribe/inform mechanism.

14. **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
    The "clears completed" test in "todoModel.test.ts" properly verifies that completed todos are removed from the model.

15. **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation  
    The uuid generation functionality is directly tested by matching the returned value against a UUID regex.

16. **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality  
    The tests validate that pluralization behaves as expected for singular and plural cases.

17. **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations  
    The store functionâ€™s behavior for both saving and retrieving data from localStorage is tested.

18. **Fail** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function  
    Although the Utils object mocks an extend method (by assigning Object.assign), there is no dedicated test verifying its functionality.

19. **Fail** (90%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx  
    While React component tests use the .test.tsx extension (as in "app.test.tsx" and "todoItem.test.tsx"), tests for non-React modules (todoModel and utils) use ".test.ts". This does not strictly meet the requested convention of using [filename].test.tsx for all tests. The ambiguity between component and non-component test naming reduces confidence, but the step as stated appears not fully satisfied.

20. **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data  
    Throughout the tests, sample todo data is consistently provided (e.g., in TodoItem and TodoApp tests), confirming the use of test fixtures.

21. **Pass** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented  
    The "filters active todos" test in "app.test.tsx" mocks the Router functionality and triggers route changes, ensuring routing functionality is covered.
