# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies Angular.js as the framework used
  
  The documentation clearly identifies AngularJS as the framework being used, mentioning its dependency injection system and using AngularJS-specific services like `$resource`, `$location`, `$rootScope`, and `$routeParams`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all factories (REST, Page, Users) are accurately documented with their purposes
  
  The documentation clearly identifies and explains the purposes of all factories:
  - REST Factory: Handles API communication
  - Page Factory: Maintains page state
  - Users Factory: Manages user data

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of the Page controller and its functionality is technically accurate
  
  The Page Controller is accurately described with its core features including auto-save system, URL generation, tag management, publication workflow, version control, and conflict detection. The controller methods are also clearly documented in the interface specifications section.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the RESTful API endpoints are correctly documented
  
  The documentation provides clear RESTful API endpoints:
  - Content management (`/api/content`)
  - Revisions tracking (`/api/content/:contentID/revisions`)
  - Tag management (`/api/content/:contentID/tags`)
  - File operations (`/api/files`)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of Angular module dependencies ($resource, $location, etc.) is correct
  
  The documentation correctly references AngularJS dependencies including `$resource`, `$location`, `$rootScope`, and `$routeParams` with appropriate contexts for their usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the page management features (creating, editing, deleting) are accurately described
  
  The documentation accurately describes page management features including creating, editing, saving, duplicating, and deleting pages, with appropriate methods and workflows.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the documentation accurately explains how the local storage mechanism works
  
  The documentation mentions the auto-save system that "persists drafts to localStorage" and includes a `localVersion()` method that "Restores locally saved version". However, it doesn't provide detailed implementation of how localStorage is being used, which reduces confidence slightly.

- **Fail** (95%): Check that the description of form validation logic is technically accurate
  
  The documentation doesn't explicitly describe form validation logic beyond mentioning "Validate URLs before saving" in the Best Practices section. It mentions required fields in the Page Factory Properties table but doesn't detail the validation mechanisms or error handling for form inputs.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of publish/schedule date handling is correct
  
  The documentation clearly explains how scheduled publication works, showing that the Page Factory includes a `published` property that can be set to `Y`, `N`, or `schedule`, and a `scheduleDate` property that is used when scheduled. It also includes code examples for handling scheduled publication.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the tag management and autocomplete feature explanation is technically accurate
  
  The tag management and autocomplete features are accurately described, including methods like `autocompleteTags()` and `selectSuggestion()`, along with HTML code examples demonstrating implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the relationship between controllers, factories, and templates is accurately explained
  
  The documentation clearly explains the MVC architecture and the relationships between Page Controller, Page Factory, REST Factory, and Page View, including initialization code and how they interact.

- **Pass** (90%): Check that the documentation correctly identifies and explains the purpose of broadcast events
  
  The documentation mentions that "Status messages broadcast via `$rootScope.$broadcast`" in the Screen Reader Support section, but doesn't provide detailed information about specific events or their purposes, which slightly reduces confidence.
