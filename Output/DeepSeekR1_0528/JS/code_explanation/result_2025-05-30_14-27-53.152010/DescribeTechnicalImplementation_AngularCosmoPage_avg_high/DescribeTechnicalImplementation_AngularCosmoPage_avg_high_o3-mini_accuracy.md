# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies Angular.js as the framework used  
  The documentation clearly references AngularJS, its dependency injection system, and the Angular module syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all factories (REST, Page, Users) are accurately documented with their purposes  
  Each factory is identified with a clear purpose: REST Factory for API communication, Page Factory for page state management, and Users Factory for user data management.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of the Page controller and its functionality is technically accurate  
  The Page Controller is described with technical details such as auto-saving, URL generation, tag management, and version control, all of which are accurate.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the RESTful API endpoints are correctly documented  
  The provided API endpoints (/api/content, /api/content/:contentID/revisions, /api/content/:contentID/tags, and /api/files) are correctly listed and described.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of Angular module dependencies ($resource, $location, etc.) is correct  
  Dependencies for Angular components like $resource, $location, $rootScope, and $routeParams are correctly mentioned in context.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the page management features (creating, editing, deleting) are accurately described  
  The documentation covers UI controls for creating, editing, duplicating, and deleting pages, along with features like template selection and publication status.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately explains how the local storage mechanism works

- **Fail** (100%): Check that the description of form validation logic is technically accurate  
  The documentation does not provide detailed information on form validation logic. It mentions best practices (e.g., validating URLs before saving) and ARIA features for accessibility, but the specifics of form validation are not elaborated.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of publish/schedule date handling is correct

  The documentation describes the tag management process, including the autocomplete functionality using methods such as autocompleteTags() and selectSuggestion(tag).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the relationship between controllers, factories, and templates is accurately explained  
  The documentation clearly details the interactions among the Page View, Page Controller, Page Factory, and REST Factory, reinforced by a clear mermaid diagram.

- **Pass** (90%): Check that the documentation correctly identifies and explains the purpose of broadcast events
