# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x
  
  The code imports from React and uses hooks that are available in React 18, such as `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`. The component is defined as a functional component with React 18 compatible patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
  
  The code uses TypeScript throughout with proper type definitions including:
  - Interface definitions (`SelectOption`, `SearchableSelectProps`)
  - Type annotations for state variables (`useState<number | null>`)
  - Type annotations for refs (`useRef<HTMLDivElement>`)
  - Event type definitions (`KeyboardEvent<HTMLInputElement>`, `FocusEvent<HTMLInputElement>`)
  - React.FC typing for the component
  - Export types in index.ts

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling
  
  The submission includes a comprehensive index.css file with styles for the component, including states like focus, hover, selected, etc. The CSS follows a BEM-like naming convention.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments
  
  The code is well-structured, properly formatted, and has no TODO comments. It follows consistent coding patterns and has clear implementation logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility
  
  The component manages state appropriately using useState hooks:
  - `isOpen` for dropdown visibility
  - `searchTerm` for the search input
  - `focusedIndex` for keyboard navigation
  - The component is controlled via the `value` and `onChange` props

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props
  
  The component accepts several props that make it customizable:
  - `options`: array of selectable options
  - `value`: the currently selected value
  - `onChange`: callback for when selection changes
  - `placeholder`: customizable placeholder text
  - `noOptionsMessage`: customizable message for when no options match

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection
  
  The component implements comprehensive keyboard navigation:
  - ArrowDown/ArrowUp for navigating options
  - Enter for selecting an option or opening the dropdown
  - Escape for closing the dropdown
  - Proper focus management within the dropdown

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions
  
  The component uses refs appropriately:
  - `containerRef` to detect clicks outside the component
  - `inputRef` to manage focus on the input element
  - DOM interactions are handled safely with proper event handling

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques
  
  The component handles focus correctly:
  - Returns focus to the input after selection
  - Maintains focus state during keyboard navigation
  - Properly handles blur events with relatedTarget checks
  - Uses useEffect to manage focus when the dropdown closes

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
  
  The component uses comprehensive ARIA attributes:
  - `role="combobox"`, `role="listbox"`, and `role="option"`
  - `aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded`, and `aria-owns`
  - `aria-autocomplete="list"` and `aria-controls`
  - `aria-selected` for selected options

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  The code appears to be free of console errors and warnings. However, without actually running the component, I cannot be 100% certain that no runtime errors would occur in all edge cases.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component
  
  The component uses state appropriately and doesn't have obvious causes for unnecessary re-renders. The useEffect hooks have appropriate dependency arrays. However, without a more complex analysis or performance testing, I can't be 100% sure there are no edge cases where unnecessary re-renders might occur.
