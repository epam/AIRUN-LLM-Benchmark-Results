# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  The code uses functional components with React Hooks and React.FC, which is consistent with React 18.x implementations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  The component files are in .tsx, and TypeScript interfaces/types (such as SelectOption and SearchableSelectProps) are used correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  An index.css file is provided, which defines the necessary classes for styling the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  The code is well-organized, documented with inline comments where needed, and does not contain any leftover TODO comments.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  The component manages its state with useState hooks for both the search term, dropdown visibility (isOpen), selected option, and focused index, which is appropriate.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  Customizable props are used (options, value, onChange, placeholder, and noOptionsMessage), ensuring the component can be reused in different contexts.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  The component handles various keyboard events (ArrowDown, ArrowUp, Enter, Escape) to enable smooth navigation and selection through the options.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  The code uses useRef to manage references for DOM nodes (containerRef, inputRef) and handles external clicks appropriately to manage dropdown state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  The focus management is handled by resetting focus when closing the dropdown and by preventing unintended blur when interacting with options, ensuring a smooth user experience.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  ARIA roles such as "combobox", "listbox", and "option" are used, along with attributes like aria-expanded, aria-haspopup, and aria-controls, which enhance accessibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  Based on the presented implementation, there are no obvious issues that would cause console errors or warnings in a typical development environment.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  The component is structured with appropriate use of state and effects. While there is no explicit memoization of functions or the component itself, the implementation follows standard practices likely avoiding unnecessary re-renders. However, without performance profiling, complete certainty is 90%.
