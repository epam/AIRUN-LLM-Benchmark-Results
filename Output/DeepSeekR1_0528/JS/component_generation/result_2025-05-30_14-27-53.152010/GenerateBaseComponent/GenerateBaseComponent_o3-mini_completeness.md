# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component renders a container with a role "combobox" and conditionally displays a dropdown (the <ul> element) when open.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  The component includes an <input> element that is used for both selection display and searching.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The component follows a controlled pattern using the "value" prop and calls "onChange" with a single value when an option is selected.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The "handleKeyDown" function handles "ArrowDown" and "ArrowUp" keys to update the focused item index.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  When an option is focused (via arrow keys), pressing Enter triggers selection using the handleSelect function.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  The code explicitly opens the dropdown when the Enter key is pressed and the dropdown is not already open.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  A useEffect hook sets focus back to the input element when the dropdown is closed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  The onClick event on each option calls handleSelect, which closes the dropdown by setting isOpen to false.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  Using the Enter key on a focused option invokes handleSelect, which closes the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  The handleKeyDown function listens for the Escape key and closes the dropdown accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  A document-level mousedown event listener checks for outside clicks and closes the dropdown if detected.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  When the input is focused and Enter is pressed (while the dropdown is closed), the component opens the dropdown.
