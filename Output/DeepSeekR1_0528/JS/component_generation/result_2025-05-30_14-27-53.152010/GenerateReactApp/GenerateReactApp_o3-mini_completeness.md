# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The code fetches character data from https://swapi.dev/api/people and maps over the results to render a list of characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The application maintains a loading state and displays a "Loading characters..." message while the API call is in progress.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  All characters obtained from the API response (`response.data.results`) are rendered in an unordered list.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  There are no search bars or input fields present; the application solely focuses on fetching and displaying character data.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each list item uses the characterâ€™s name, and a unique key (character.url) is assigned to each element.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The presence of "react-scripts" in package.json and the typical CRA folder structure (src, public, etc.) indicates that Create React App was used.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The code uses React hooks (useState and useEffect) to manage state for loading, error conditions, and the character data.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  Unique keys are provided using the character URL, which ensures efficient rendering of list items.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  While the code correctly manages loading and error states, it does not explicitly handle the scenario where the fetched characters array is empty (e.g., displaying a message like "No characters found"). This could lead to a blank UI without user feedback if the API returns an empty array.
