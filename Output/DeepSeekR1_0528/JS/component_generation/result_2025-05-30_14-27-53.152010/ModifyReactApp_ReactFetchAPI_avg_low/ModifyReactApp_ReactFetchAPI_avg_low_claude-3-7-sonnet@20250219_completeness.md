# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name
    
    The code includes a search input field with appropriate attributes (type="text", onChange handler, placeholder text, and aria-label for accessibility). The input is connected to the state via the `searchTerm` state variable and has a change handler that updates this state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests
    
    The code properly implements a loading indicator that displays "Loading characters..." when the `loading` state is true. This state is set to true before API requests begin and is set to false after they complete (in the finally block).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query
    
    The useEffect hook is triggered on component mount and calls the fetchCharacters function. The API URL is constructed to handle both empty search terms and search queries, ensuring initial data is loaded correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type
    
    The code implements a debounced search with the custom `useDebounce` hook set to a 500ms delay. This ensures search results update dynamically after the user stops typing, without making excessive API calls during typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found
    
    The code includes a conditional rendering that displays "No characters found" when the characters array is empty after a search has completed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design
    
    The component uses CSS class names that suggest a responsive design approach. Class names like "character-search", "search-container", and "character-list" are included for styling, which would allow for responsive design implementation in the associated CSS.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response
    
    The code renders a list of characters when the API request completes successfully. It maps through the characters array and displays each character's name in a list item.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed
    
    The code includes proper error handling with try/catch blocks for API requests. It displays an error message with a retry button when API requests fail, and also handles request cancellations appropriately using Axios CancelToken.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props
    
    The code defines proper TypeScript interfaces for the Character and ApiResponse types, and includes appropriate type annotations throughout (for state variables, function parameters, and component types).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities
    
    The code maintains the core functionality of displaying Star Wars characters while adding search capabilities. It includes appropriate loading states, error handling, and result display, ensuring the original functionality is preserved while adding the new search feature.
