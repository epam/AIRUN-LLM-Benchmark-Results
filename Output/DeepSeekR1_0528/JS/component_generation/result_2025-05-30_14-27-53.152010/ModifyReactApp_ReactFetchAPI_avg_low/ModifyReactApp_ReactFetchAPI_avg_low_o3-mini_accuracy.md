# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type  
  The input element uses the onChange handler (handleSearchChange) to update the searchTerm state correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls  
  The code implements a custom useDebounce hook with a delay of 500ms, which falls within the specified range.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured  
  Axios is used to make the API call, and CancelToken is configured to handle request cancellation appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses  
  The code declares TypeScript interfaces (e.g., Character, ApiResponse) and annotates the component and event handlers properly.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters  
  The URL is built dynamically to include the "?search=" parameter when a search term is present, ensuring correct endpoint construction.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate  
  The fetchCharacters function is memoized using useCallback, which aids in performance optimization. Although useMemo is not used, the requirement is met with the use of useCallback.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback  
  The try/catch block in fetchCharacters handles errors effectively, setting an error state and providing a retry button for user feedback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing  
  The useDebounce hook delays the search term update, ensuring the API is called only after the user stops typing for 500ms.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices  
  The code utilizes useState for managing searchTerm, characters, loading, and error, following standard React state management practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code  
  There are no extraneous console errors, import issues, or commented-out code segments observed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests  
  The loading state is set appropriately at the start and end of the API call, ensuring that the UI accurately reflects the request status.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns  
  The component leverages functional components and hooks, which are in line with React 18.x best practices.
