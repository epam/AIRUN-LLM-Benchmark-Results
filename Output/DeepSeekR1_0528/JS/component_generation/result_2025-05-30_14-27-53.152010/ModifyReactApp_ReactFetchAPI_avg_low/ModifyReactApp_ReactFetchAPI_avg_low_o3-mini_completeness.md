# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The code includes an <input> element with a placeholder "Search characters..." and an onChange handler that updates the search term, which is then used to filter characters via the API request.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  During API requests, the state variable "loading" is set to true, and a loading indicator (with the text "Loading characters...") is conditionally rendered.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  On mount, the search term is initially an empty string. The effect hook calls the fetch function with an API request that uses an empty search parameter, thereby loading the initial character list.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  The implementation uses a debounced search term hook (useDebounce) and a useCallback-wrapped fetch function, ensuring that as the user types and the debounced value changes, an API request is issued and results are updated.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  When the API returns an empty array (i.e., no matching characters), the component renders a list item with the class "no-results" containing the message "No characters found".

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The code is structured with CSS-ready class names (e.g., "character-search", "search-container", and "search-input") intended for styling and responsiveness. However, the actual responsive styling is assumed to be handled externally via CSS, which is not shown in the code. This results in a slight deduction in confidence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  Search results obtained from the API are stored in the "characters" state and then rendered in a list, satisfying the requirement to display the results.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  The code includes error handling via a try/catch block. When an error (other than cancellation) occurs, an error message is set and rendered along with a "Retry" button, providing appropriate error UI feedback.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The code defines TypeScript interfaces for both Character and ApiResponse, and all functions and components use proper type annotations, ensuring type safety throughout.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The enhanced search functionality (debounced search and API request cancellation) is integrated without removing any of the original functionality. The component still fetches and displays an initial set of characters and dynamically updates results based on user input.
