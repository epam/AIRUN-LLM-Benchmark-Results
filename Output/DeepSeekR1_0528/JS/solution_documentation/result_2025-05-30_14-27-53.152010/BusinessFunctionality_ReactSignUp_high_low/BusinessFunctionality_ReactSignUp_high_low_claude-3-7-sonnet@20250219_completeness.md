- **Fail** (90%): Ensure the documentation describes the integration with React Router for navigation
  
  The documentation does not explicitly mention React Router integration for navigation. While it mentions navigation to login and redirects after successful signup, it doesn't specifically state that React Router is used for this purpose.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains how the form handles submission states (submitting, disabled)
  
  The documentation explains form submission states in multiple sections, including in the User Experience Design section mentioning "Button disable during submission" and in Technical Optimizations noting "Disabled UI during async operations".
