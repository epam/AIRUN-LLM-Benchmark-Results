- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the counter for remaining items
  
  The item counter is mentioned:
  - Listed in Section 1 as "Item counter display" under Key Features
  - TodoFooter component is described as containing "filters/counters"

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the persistent storage of todos
  
  Persistence is thoroughly covered:
  - Listed in Section 1 as "Persistent storage using localStorage"
  - Detailed in Section 6 under "Persistence Mechanism" with code example
  - Included in technical constraints and assumptions

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the UI components and their relationships
  
  Component relationships are clearly defined:
