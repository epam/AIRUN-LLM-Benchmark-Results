# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components
  
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately
  
- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation
  
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization
  
- **Fail** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization
  
  The submitted code does not implement code splitting for performance optimization. There are no React.lazy() or dynamic import() statements that would indicate code splitting is being used. Code splitting is an important performance optimization technique in React applications to reduce initial bundle size by loading components only when needed.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations
  
  There is no evidence of React.memo being used in the provided code, despite it being mentioned in the "Key Changes and Improvements" section. The PageEditor component or other potentially expensive components are not wrapped with React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks
  
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models
  
- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks
