# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props  
  Although the codebase makes extensive use of TypeScript interfaces (e.g., in types.ts, Redux slices, and component definitions with React.FC), some parts (such as API response typings and a few function parameters) use the any type or lack explicit typing. This does not fully meet extremely strict typing requirements, but overall, the implementation is sound.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management  
  Both pageSlice.ts and appSlice.ts utilize createSlice from Redux Toolkit, properly creating reducers and action creators.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components  
  All provided components (e.g., PageEditor, App) are defined as functional components.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately  
  The code uses useState and useEffect effectively. Although useCallback or useMemo are not employed for potential expensive operations, their absence does not harm functionality. Improved optimization might be possible, but the current hook usage is appropriate.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource  
  The code clearly uses axios for API calls in the apiService.ts module.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components  
  Form elements (inputs, textareas, select) are wired to the component state via Redux and local state, ensuring controlled behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation  
  The App.tsx file shows routing configured using react-router-dom with BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization  
  The solution utilizes react-i18next and provides a proper i18n configuration.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization  
  There is no evidence of code splitting (e.g., lazy loading of components with React.lazy or dynamic import) in the implementation.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations  
  The implementation does not wrap any components with React.memo, which would be useful for optimizing expensive render tasks.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks  
  The useEffect hooks include dependency arrays (e.g., [url, dispatch] in PageEditor and [page, urlParam] in the custom local storage hook). While there is room for discussion about ensuring all dependencies are declared, the provided arrays are essentially correct.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models  
  All major data models (e.g., Page, User, PageState) are defined in the types.ts file, ensuring a clear contract for data.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state  
  The components use useSelector to retrieve state from the Redux store, as demonstrated in PageEditor.tsx.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations  
  Action creators (such as updatePage, resetPage, etc.) are defined in the Redux slices and used appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks  
  The custom hook useLocalStorage demonstrates a proper approach to interacting with local storage via useEffect.
