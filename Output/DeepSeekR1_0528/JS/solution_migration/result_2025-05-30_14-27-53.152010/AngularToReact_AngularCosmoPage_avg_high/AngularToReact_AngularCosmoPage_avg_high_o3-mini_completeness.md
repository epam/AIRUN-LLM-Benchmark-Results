# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
  The code includes API calls and corresponding UI actions for creating (including duplicate via contentAPI.create), updating (contentAPI.update and updatePage), and deleting (contentAPI.delete with handleDelete) a page.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
  The component renders a select element populated with theme pages allowing the user to choose the page type.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
  In handleTitleChange the title is updated and, if autoURL is active, a URL is automatically generated by converting the title to lowercase, replacing spaces with hyphens, and stripping invalid characters.  

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
  The code splits tag strings, dispatches updates via updatePage, and fetches autocomplete suggestions using tagsAPI.getSuggestions which are rendered as clickable buttons.  

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
  Three radio buttons are provided to set the publish status to “Y” (publish), “N” (draft), or “schedule”.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
  A datetime-local input appears when publish is set to “schedule”, allowing the user to select a scheduled publishing date.  

- **Fail** (80%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
  A local storage hook (useLocalStorage) is present that saves page fields, and there is a UI section guarded by the appState.newerVersion flag with options for discard, compare, and use; however, the actual implementation for version comparison/restoration (the handleLocalVersion function) is missing. This makes it unclear how the restoration is handled.  

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
  Although there are comments indicating where success notifications and error handling would occur, no actual notification system or user feedback mechanism is implemented.  

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
  There is no explicit validation logic shown for required fields such as URL or page type. Users could leave these fields empty without any client-side checks.  

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
  The API service covers endpoints for content (get, create, update, delete) and tags, but in the PageEditor component there is a call to contentAPI.getByUrl which is not defined in the apiService. This inconsistency suggests that not all API endpoints are properly implemented.  

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
  While the Page and PageState types include an extras field, there is no UI or business logic provided to manage or update extras.  

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
  There is no evidence of any mechanism for maintaining or accessing revision history in the provided implementation.  

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
  The code is structured into separate modules for types, Redux slices, API services, hooks, and components. Although further refinement could be done, the separation of concerns is generally maintained.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
  The i18n configuration is properly set up and the PageEditor component correctly uses react-i18next to load and apply translations.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
  The Router is configured with routes ("/edit/:url" and "/new") matching the intended URL structure, thereby preserving URL parameters as required.
