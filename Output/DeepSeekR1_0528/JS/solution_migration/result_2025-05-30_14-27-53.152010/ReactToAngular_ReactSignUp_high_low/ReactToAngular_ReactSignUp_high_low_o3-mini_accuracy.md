# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The component is created using FormBuilder to construct a FormGroup, confirming correct usage of Angular Reactive Forms.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The signup form includes Validators.required, Validators.minLength, Validators.maxLength for the name field, Validators.email for email, and Validators.minLength for the password.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  The form setup includes asynchronous validators (uniqueNameValidator and uniqueEmailValidator) applied to the name and email controls.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The FormGroupComponent conditionally displays error messages based on control.touched and control.errors. While the implementation correctly provides feedback, a more detailed review of the CSS classes (e.g., ensuring 'has-error' styling is fully defined) could further confirm complete adherence.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  On form submission, the component calls authService.signup and, upon a successful response, dispatches the signupComplete action to the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The FormGroupComponent template renders error messages in a span element when any control error is present, ensuring feedback is provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  In ngOnInit, the component sets the title via this.title.setTitle('Signup - PodBaby'), meeting the requirement.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  Although the component imports and utilizes @ngrx/store by dispatching an action, there is no visible integration of @ngrx/effects in the provided code. This may indicate that effects, which handle asynchronous side effects, are not directly implemented or shown in this snippet.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button binding [disabled]="submitting" properly prevents additional submissions when a request is in progress.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  The API call within onSubmit uses subscribe with next and error callbacks, properly handling the response scenarios.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component correctly uses dependency injection, lifecycle hooks, and modular design. While the structure is sound, best practices are always subject to further team-specific refinements.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The AuthService makes use of Angularâ€™s HttpClient module with Observable patterns, which is consistent with current best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The error messages such as "This field is required", "Must be at least ... characters", "This name is already in use", etc., are correctly implemented in the FormGroupComponent.
