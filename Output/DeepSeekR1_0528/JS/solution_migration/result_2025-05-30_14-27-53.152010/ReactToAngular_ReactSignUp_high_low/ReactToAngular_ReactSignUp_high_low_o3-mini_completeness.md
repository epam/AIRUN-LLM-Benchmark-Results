  A dedicated <code>FormGroupComponent</code> is implemented to manage form field styling and display validation errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Icon component or equivalent is implemented for the signup button  
  Although a separate Icon component is not used, the inclusion of an <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tag with proper classes achieves the equivalent functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API integration is complete with proper error handling

  The form has the "form-horizontal" class and the overall layout is structured using Angular best practices, aligning with a horizontal layout.
