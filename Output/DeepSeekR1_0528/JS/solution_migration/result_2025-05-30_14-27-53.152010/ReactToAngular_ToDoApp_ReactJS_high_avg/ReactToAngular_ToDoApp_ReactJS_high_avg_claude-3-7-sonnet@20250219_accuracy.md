# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (80%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  While the code clearly shows an Angular implementation with typical Angular structures and patterns, there is no explicit version number mentioned in the provided code. The code uses modern Angular features that are compatible with Angular 14.x, but without explicit version information in package.json or elsewhere, I cannot confirm with 100% certainty that this is specifically targeting Angular 14.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
  
  The code clearly uses @ngrx/store for state management with proper imports from '@ngrx/store' and implementation of store-related functionality like reducers, actions, and selectors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
  
  The code includes proper implementation of @ngrx/effects with imports and a TodoEffects class that uses createEffect() to handle side effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
  
  The code properly implements NgRx patterns with:
  - Actions defined in todo.actions.ts
  - Reducers implemented in todo.reducer.ts
  - Selectors created in todo.selectors.ts

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
  
  The code shows proper use of Angular decorators including @Component for component definitions and @Input/@Output for component communication.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators
  
  The provided code does not show explicit use of @ViewChild decorators to replace React refs. While input elements are accessed through template reference variables (like in `handleNewTodoKeyDown(event: KeyboardEvent, input: HTMLInputElement)`), there's no explicit @ViewChild usage shown in the implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
  
  The TodoItemComponent properly uses @Input for receiving data and @Output with EventEmitters for sending events to parent components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
  
  The code includes proper Angular services like TodoService and UtilsService with appropriate @Injectable decorators for handling business logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
  
  The code uses Angular's dependency injection system correctly, injecting services and the Store into components through constructor parameters.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
  
  The provided code does not include any change detection strategy configurations. For optimal performance, components should often use ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush, but this is not present in any of the component definitions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
  
  The code includes proper Angular Router setup with an AppRoutingModule and route definitions for different views.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code follows Angular naming conventions and structure guidelines, with proper naming of files, components, and services.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
  
  The code shows proper use of TypeScript interfaces for models (Todo) and state management (AppState, TodoState).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
  
  The code structure shows that components have separate HTML template files (.component.html) which would contain Angular templates instead of JSX.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
  
  The code shows proper Angular event handling patterns using Angular's event binding syntax rather than React's approach.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs
  
  There are no visible TODOs in the provided code, but the TodoEffects implementation appears to be cut off at the end, making it difficult to verify it's complete.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules
  
  The provided code does not show implementation of lazy loading for feature modules. The AppRoutingModule only includes direct component routes, without lazy loading configuration.
