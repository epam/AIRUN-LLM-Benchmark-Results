# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items

    The provided migration plan includes the structure for displaying todos through the `todo-app.component.ts` and the NgRx store setup, but it doesn't include the complete HTML template for the todo-app component that would actually display the todo items. The `todo-app.component.html` file content is missing, which is crucial for rendering the todo list.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented

    The functionality for adding new todo items is properly implemented in the `TodoAppComponent` with the `handleNewTodoKeyDown` method and in the NgRx store with the `addTodo` action and corresponding reducer case.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works

    Toggle functionality is properly implemented with the `toggleTodo` action in the store and the `toggle` event emitter in the `TodoItemComponent`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented

    Editing functionality is implemented through the `setEditing` method in the `TodoAppComponent` and the corresponding event emitters in the `TodoItemComponent`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented

    Deletion functionality is implemented with the `deleteTodo` action in the store and the `destroy` event emitter in the `TodoItemComponent`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented

    The 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented via the `toggleAll` method in the `TodoAppComponent` and the corresponding action in the NgRx store.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works

    Filtering functionality is implemented through the routing setup in `app-routing.module.ts` and the `selectFilteredTodos` selector in the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items

    The footer would display the active count as the component is set up to observe `activeCount$` from the store, though the actual HTML template for the footer component is not provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items

    The 'Clear completed' functionality is implemented via the `clearCompleted` action in the store.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage

    While there is an `Effects` class set up that could handle persistence, the actual implementation for saving todos to local storage is not complete. The `persistTodos$` effect is started but not finished in the provided code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation

    The routing is set up correctly in `app-routing.module.ts` with routes for '/all', '/active', and '/completed', maintaining the expected URL structure.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states

    There is no specific handling or UI components shown for empty states in the provided code. This is usually important for user experience when there are no todos to display.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly

    Form submissions are handled properly through the `handleNewTodoKeyDown` method for adding new todos and the `onSubmit` method in the `TodoItemComponent` for editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships

    The component hierarchy and relationships are well-defined with the `TodoAppComponent` as the parent and `TodoItemComponent` for individual items, along with proper input/output bindings.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved

    The core business logic for managing todos is preserved and properly adapted to the Angular/NgRx architecture with actions, reducers, and selectors.
