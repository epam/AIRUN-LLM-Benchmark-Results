# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The migration plan explicitly notes the use of Angular 14.x and the code structure aligns with Angular 14.x conventions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The provided code imports and uses @ngrx/store with proper StoreModule configuration and state management logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  The plan includes an EffectsModule setup in the app module and includes a TodoEffects class.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  All required files (actions, reducer, selectors) for the Todo feature are present and implemented correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  Components such as TodoAppComponent and TodoItemComponent are correctly decorated with @Component, and property/event bindings are handled with @Input and @Output respectively.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  The plan does not show any usage of Angular’s @ViewChild, nor does it address the replacement of React refs.  
  Since the migration originates from a React application, replacing React refs with @ViewChild would be expected if they were used in the original. The absence of such a conversion indicates this step did not meet the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  Component communication is properly implemented in the provided Angular components using the necessary decorators.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  The migration includes Angular services (TodoService and UtilsService) that handle data operations and business logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  The code shows dependency injection in components and services through constructor parameters.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  While the code uses Angular’s default change detection, no explicit change detection strategies (like OnPush) are specified.  
  This might be acceptable in many cases, but if performance optimizations are expected for specific components, the lack of explicit strategies can be seen as a shortcoming. Confidence is 90% because it is possible that the default strategy was intended.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  The AppRoutingModule is defined, and routes are correctly set up using Angular Router.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code and file structure follow common Angular conventions and best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  The plan includes TypeScript interfaces (e.g., Todo, AppState) ensuring type safety across the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  The migration clearly shows component HTML files (e.g., todo-app.component.html) indicating that JSX has been replaced with Angular templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  React event handling patterns are replaced by Angular event bindings, as observed in event handler methods like onKeyDown and onSubmit.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  No TODO comments are visible in the provided migration plan or code snippets.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  The migration plan does not include any configuration or mention of lazy loading for feature modules.  
  In larger Angular applications, lazy loading is a common performance optimization technique, so its absence is a failure for this criterion.
