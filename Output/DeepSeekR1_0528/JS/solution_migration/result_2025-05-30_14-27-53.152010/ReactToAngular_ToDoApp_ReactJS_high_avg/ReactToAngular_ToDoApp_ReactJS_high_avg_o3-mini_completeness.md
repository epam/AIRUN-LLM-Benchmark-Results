# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The plan uses the TodoAppComponent with observables (selectTodos) and clearly structures the display components to show todo items.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The implementation in TodoAppComponent (handleNewTodoKeyDown) and the TodoService’s addTodo method provide clear mechanisms to add new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  Both individual toggling (via TodoService.toggleTodo) and bulk toggling (via toggleAllTodos) are implemented in the service and reducer.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent contains onEdit, onSubmit, and onKeyDown methods, and TodoAppComponent manages an editing state, which together support editing functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoService.deleteTodo method exists along with the corresponding deleteTodo action and reducer handling, which indicates deletion is supported.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  The TodoAppComponent has a toggleAll method that dispatches the toggleAllTodos action, covering the "mark all as complete" scenario.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  The routing module defines paths for “all”, “active”, and “completed” along with a filter-setting mechanism in TodoAppComponent that uses the setFilter action, and the selectors filter the todos accordingly.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoAppComponent sets up an observable (activeCount$) computed via selectActiveCount, and although the TodoFooterComponent code isn’t shown, the integration in the plan implies it retrieves these counts. (I am 90% confident because the actual footer UI code is not provided, but the design suggests it is handled.)

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  A clearCompleted action exists and is handled in the reducer as well as being exposed in the TodoService. While the UI element for triggering this isn’t shown explicitly, the functionality is present. (90% confidence due to missing explicit UI snippet.)

- **Fail** (95%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  The migration plan includes a TodoEffects file intended for persistence; however, the provided code snippet for TodoEffects is incomplete and does not show any explicit logic for persisting to local storage. (95% confidence because the intention is seen but the implementation is missing.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The AppRoutingModule defines the routes (for "", "all", "active", and "completed"), ensuring the URL structure mirrors that of the typical todo application.

- **Fail** (80%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  While the overall structure appears complete, there is no explicit indication in the provided components that an empty state (e.g., “no todos”) is handled. (80% confidence due to absence of explicit empty state UI handling.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  The form submission for creating a new todo is managed by checking for the "Enter" key, and the input is trimmed before dispatching the addTodo action, which shows proper handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The application is split into distinct components (TodoAppComponent, TodoItemComponent, TodoFooterComponent) with clear service-based communication, reflecting proper component relationships.

- **Pass** (85%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  The migration plan includes detailed implementations for actions, reducers, selectors, and effects (even though the persistence effect is incomplete) which suggests that the core business logic (adding, editing, toggling, deleting todos, filtering, etc.) is maintained. (85% confidence due to the incomplete persistence implementation.)
