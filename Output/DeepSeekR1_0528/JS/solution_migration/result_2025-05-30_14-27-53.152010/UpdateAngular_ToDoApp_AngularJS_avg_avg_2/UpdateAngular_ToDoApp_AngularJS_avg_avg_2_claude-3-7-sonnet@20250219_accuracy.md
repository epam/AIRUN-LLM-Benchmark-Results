# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The provided code clearly implements Angular, and specifically references NgRx which is compatible with Angular 14.x. The syntax and patterns used are consistent with Angular 14.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS
  
  The code consistently uses ES modules with import/export syntax throughout all files, replacing the older RequireJS module system.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management
  
  The code properly implements @ngrx/store with imports from '@ngrx/store' and proper setup in the app.module.ts file using StoreModule.forRoot().

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects
  
  The code includes proper implementation of @ngrx/effects with imports from '@ngrx/effects' and setup in app.module.ts using EffectsModule.forRoot().

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management
  
  The code includes comprehensive implementation of:
  - Actions (loadTodos, addTodo, removeTodo, etc.)
  - Reducer (handling all action cases)
  - Selectors (selectTodos, selectFilteredTodos, etc.)
  - Effects (for persistence and loading)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator
  
  The TodoStorageService properly uses the @Injectable decorator with the 'providedIn: "root"' pattern.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service
  
  The TodoStorageService correctly uses localStorage for data persistence. However, there's a syntax error in the getTodos() method where the empty array fallback is not properly formatted:
  ```typescript
  return JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(this.STORAGE_KEY) || [];
  ```
  It should be:
  ```typescript
  return JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(this.STORAGE_KEY) || '[]');
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators
  
  All components (AppComponent, HeaderComponent, TodoListComponent, TodoItemComponent, FooterComponent) use proper @Component decorators with appropriate metadata.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators
  
  Both custom directives (TodoFocusDirective, TodoEscapeDirective) use proper @Directive decorators with appropriate selectors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)
  
  The component templates correctly use Angular template syntax including *ngFor, *ngIf, and *ngElse with ng-template.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))
  
  The code consistently uses proper Angular event binding syntax such as (click), (change), (submit), etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])
  
  The code correctly uses property binding syntax like [class.completed], [checked], [todoFocus], etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed
  
  Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented, including OnInit in AppComponent and AfterViewChecked in TodoFocusDirective.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models
  
  The code defines and uses TypeScript interfaces for data models including Todo and TodoState.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services
  
  Dependency injection is properly implemented throughout the application with constructor injection for Store, Router, and services.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code follows Angular style guide conventions including naming patterns, file organization, and decorator usage.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings
  
  There are a few issues that would lead to errors:
  1. In the TodoStorageService, there's a syntax error in the getTodos method
  2. In the FooterComponent, there's an issue with the router.url observable definition
  3. In some templates, there are references to $event.target.checked which would cause errors in strict mode

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)
  
  The code consistently uses TypeScript features including interfaces, types, generics, and type annotations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code
  
  The code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code sections.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design
  
  The components are well-structured with clear separation of concerns. Each component (header, todo-list, todo-item, footer) has a single responsibility, and the state management is properly separated into NgRx patterns.
