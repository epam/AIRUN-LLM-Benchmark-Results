- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos

    There is a syntax error in the TodoStorageService's getTodos method. The code tries to use an empty array as a default value, but the syntax is incorrect:
    ```typescript
    getTodos(): Todo[] {
      return JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(this.STORAGE_KEY) || [];
    }
    ```
    
    The correct syntax should be:
    ```typescript
    getTodos(): Todo[] {
      return JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(this.STORAGE_KEY) || '[]');
    }
    ```
    
    The error is missing the closing parenthesis and quotes around the empty array string.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately
- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter

    There are issues with the router implementation in the FooterComponent. The code uses `(router.url | async)` but the implementation is problematic:
    
    ```typescript
    router = {
      url: this.router.events.pipe(map(() => this.router.url))
    };
    ```
    
    This implementation is incorrect and will cause runtime errors because:
    1. It's missing the import for `map` operator
    2. It's attempting to create a custom `router` property that shadows the injected Router
    3. The URL comparison in the template is incorrect
    
    A correct implementation would be:
    
    ```typescript
    routerUrl$ = this.router.events.pipe(
      filter(event => event instanceof NavigationEnd),
      map(() => this.router.url)
    );
    ```
    
    And in the template:
    ```html
    <a [class.selected]="(routerUrl$ | async) === '/'" routerLink="/">All</a>
    ```
