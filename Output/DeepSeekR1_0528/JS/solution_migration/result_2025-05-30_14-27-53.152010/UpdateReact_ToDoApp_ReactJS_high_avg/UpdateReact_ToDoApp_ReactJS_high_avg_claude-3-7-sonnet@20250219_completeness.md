# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed
  
  The code properly implements the todo input field that creates new todos when the Enter key is pressed. The `handleNewTodoKeyDown` function in the TodoApp component checks for the Enter key, retrieves the value from the input field, and dispatches the `addTodo` action if the value is not empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter
  
  The application correctly displays todo items based on the selected filter. The `selectFilteredTodos` selector in the todoSlice filters todos based on the current filter state ('all', 'active', or 'completed'), and these filtered todos are then mapped to TodoItem components in the TodoApp component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos
  
  The code includes functionality to toggle all todos through the `toggleAll` action in the todoSlice and the toggle-all checkbox input in the TodoApp component, which dispatches this action when changed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted
  
  The TodoItem component includes functionality for toggling completion status (via the checkbox input), editing (via double-click and edit field), and deleting (via the destroy button) individual todos. These actions dispatch the corresponding Redux actions: `toggleTodo`, `saveTodo`, and `destroyTodo`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode
  
  The TodoItem component includes the `onDoubleClick` event handler on the label element that sets the editing state to true, which causes the edit input field to be displayed and focused.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo
  
  The TodoItem component includes a `handleKeyDown` function that checks for the Enter key and calls `handleSubmit` when detected, which saves the edited todo value.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value
  
  The TodoItem component's `handleKeyDown` function checks for the Escape key and, when detected, resets the edit text to the original todo title and exits editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The TodoFooter component receives the count of active items as a prop and displays it along with the properly pluralized word "item" or "items".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The TodoFooter component includes a filters section with links for All, Active, and Completed that update the current filter when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos
  
  The TodoFooter component includes a "Clear completed" button that is conditionally rendered when there are completed todos, and it calls the `onClearCompleted` prop function when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence
  
  The store configuration includes a subscribe handler that saves todos to localStorage whenever the state changes, and the initial state is loaded from localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state
  
  The application conditionally renders UI elements based on the state of todos. For example, the main section is only shown when there are todos, and the "Clear completed" button is only shown when there are completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count
  
  The Utils class includes a `pluralize` function that correctly handles pluralization based on count, and this is used in the TodoFooter component for the "items left" text.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components
  
  The application is divided into smaller, focused components: TodoApp as the main container, TodoItem for individual todo items, and TodoFooter for filtering and statistics. Each component has a clear responsibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality
  
  The code is organized by feature/functionality with separate files for components (TodoApp, TodoItem, TodoFooter), state management (store, todoSlice), utilities, and constants.
