# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The TodoApp component includes a new todo input field that listens for the Enter key (e.key === 'Enter') and dispatches addTodo when a non-empty value is provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The application uses the selectFilteredTodos selector to display the list of todos filtered based on the current filter state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  A checkbox with the id "toggle-all" is implemented in TodoApp that calls the toggleAll reducer upon change, toggling the completed state of all todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  The TodoItem component includes a checkbox to toggle completion, an editable input field triggered by double-click, and a button that dispatches destroyTodo to delete the todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  In TodoItem, a double-click on the todo's label triggers setEditing(true), which enables editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  When a user presses Enter while editing a todo, the onKeyDown event calls handleSubmit(), which either saves the edited value or deletes the todo if the input is empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  The onKeyDown handler in TodoItem checks for the Escape key, resetting the editText to the original todo.title and canceling editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooter component receives and displays the count of active items correctly through its props.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  TodoFooter renders three filter links (All, Active, Completed) that dispatch setFilter actions to update the view.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  When there are completed todos, the TodoFooter conditionally renders a "Clear completed" button that triggers onClearCompleted.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  In the store configuration, a subscription updates localStorage with the latest todos by serializing the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  The main section with the todo list is conditionally rendered only when todos exist (todos.length > 0).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  The Utils.pluralize function is utilized within TodoFooter to correctly pluralize "item" based on the count value.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The code is modularized into separate components (TodoApp, TodoItem, TodoFooter) that each manage specific functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The project structure separates files into folders such as components, store, constants, and utils to maintain clear organization based on functionality.
