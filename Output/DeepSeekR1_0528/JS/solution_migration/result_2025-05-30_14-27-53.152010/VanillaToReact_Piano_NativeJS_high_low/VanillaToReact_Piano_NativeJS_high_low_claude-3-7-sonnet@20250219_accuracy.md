# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration
  
  The implementation clearly uses React 18 as indicated in the import statements `import React from 'react';` and `import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';` with the client-side rendering approach using `ReactDOM.createRoot()`, which is specific to React 18. TypeScript is used throughout with proper file extensions (.tsx, .ts) and type declarations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure
  
  The code defines appropriate TypeScript interfaces including `PianoKeyConfig`, `ViewMode`, and others. The audio mapping structure is properly typed with `Record<string, string>` in the `useAudio.ts` hook.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks
  
  All components (Piano, PianoKey, ToggleButton, FullscreenButton) are implemented as functional components using the React.FC type annotation, and they utilize hooks like useState, useEffect, useCallback, and useRef appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)
  
  The implementation uses proper state management with useState for activeNotes and viewMode, and useEffect for keyboard event handling and audio initialization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels
  
  Keyboard event handlers are implemented at the App component level using useEffect to add and remove event listeners for keydown and keyup events, with proper mapping to piano notes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events
  
  Mouse interactions are properly implemented using React synthetic events like onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseLeave, and onMouseMove, with appropriate handlers for piano key interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment
  
  Audio resources are handled through a custom useAudio hook that preloads audio files, stores them in a useRef, and provides a play function that handles audio playback with proper error handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility
  
  Fullscreen functionality is implemented in the FullscreenButton component using standard web APIs (requestFullscreen and exitFullscreen) wrapped in a React component that manages the toggling behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns
  
  Conditional class application is implemented using template literals and ternary operators, following React patterns. For example: `` `piano-key ${isSharp ? 'sharp' : ''} ${isNone ? 'none' : ''} ${isActive ? 'piano-key-active' : ''}` ``.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate
  
  The PianoKey component is memoized using React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders when parent components update. Additionally, useCallback is used for event handlers to maintain referential equality across renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations
  
  Audio playback is handled through the useAudio custom hook, which uses useEffect for initialization and cleanup. The audio elements are stored in a useRef to persist across renders, and the play function properly resets currentTime before playing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application
  
  The code consistently uses TypeScript typing throughout, with properly defined interfaces for component props, state, and event handlers. Type annotations are provided for all functions and variables where appropriate.
