# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration  
  The provided code uses ReactDOM.createRoot (from "react-dom/client") and includes installation instructions for React 18 with TypeScript, which confirms the application is targeted to React 18 and follows a Create React App with TypeScript setup.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure  
  The solution types the audio mapping using TypeScript’s built‐in Record type (Record<string, string>) in the useAudio hook. Although no explicit standalone interface is defined for the audio mapping, the proper TypeScript type is applied to ensure type safety. This meets the requirement, but because the evaluation expected a dedicated interface, confidence is 90%.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks  
  All components (PianoKey, Piano, ToggleButton, FullscreenButton, App, etc.) are implemented as functional components and utilize React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback), which satisfies this evaluation step.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)  
  The App component manages state using useState for active notes and view mode, and useEffect is used for side effects like keyboard event listeners and audio preloading. This correctly implements state management and UI interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels  
  Keyboard event handlers are added in the App component on the document level using useEffect. This is an appropriate level for global events and properly captures keydown and keyup events.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events  
  The PianoKey and Piano components use onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseLeave, and onMouseMove handlers, which are React’s synthetic event system. This meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment  
  The custom hook (useAudio) preloads audio files in a useEffect hook and manages audio ref objects, ensuring that audio is handled efficiently and correctly within the React lifecycle.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility  
  The FullscreenButton component uses a React onClick event handler to toggle fullscreen mode by checking document.fullscreenElement and calling requestFullscreen or exitFullscreen. This straightforward implementation aligns with React patterns and the general browser API.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns  
  Conditional classes in components (e.g., PianoKey) are applied using template literals and conditional expressions, adhering to standard React practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate  
  The PianoKey component is wrapped with React.memo to avoid unnecessary re-renders, which is a performance optimization that satisfies the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations  
  The audio playback is managed through the custom hook with correct useEffect usage for preloading and resetting audio time before playing, ensuring integration with React’s lifecycle.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application  
  The solution consistently applies TypeScript interfaces and types (e.g., Props interfaces, type aliases, the Record type) across components and hooks, ensuring strict type safety throughout the application.
