# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'  
  The App component renders a header element that includes an h1 tag with the text "Virtual Piano". This meets the requirement clearly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons  
  The ToggleButton component contains a div with the class "btn-container" and renders two buttons labeled "Notes" and "Letters". This fulfills the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)  
  The Piano component maps over the configuration arrays (WHITE_KEYS and BLACK_KEYS) to render both natural and sharp keys. Even keys marked as "none" (for layout purposes) are handled, so all expected keys are rendered.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes  
  The PianoKey component conditionally assigns data-letter and data-note attributes (omitting them for "none" keys). This maintains the required attribute assignments.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked  
  The useAudio hook preloads audio files mapped by note names, and the onPlay callback in App invokes the play function with the correct note. The wiring between piano keys and audio playback is present and correct.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)  
  PianoKey applies the class "piano-key-active" when the isActive property is true. This visual indication for active keys is correctly implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes  
  The App component adds event listeners for keydown and keyup events using a keyMap to associate keyboard keys with piano notes. This implementation confirms that keyboard inputs correctly trigger audio.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked  
  The ToggleButton component and the viewMode state in App toggle between 'notes' and 'letters', and the Piano component uses the viewMode prop to decide whether to display the note or the letter. This meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes  
  FullscreenButton includes a function that requests or exits fullscreen mode using the standard Fullscreen API. The implementation correctly toggles the fullscreen state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly  
  The App maintains an array of activeNotes and adds a note only if it isnâ€™t already active, allowing multiple notes to be active simultaneously. The state management in conjunction with event handlers supports simultaneous key presses.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys  
  The Piano component defines an onMouseMove handler that checks if the left mouse button is pressed (using e.buttons) and then triggers note playback when dragging over keys. This ensures mouse drag functionality is handled.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information  
  The App component renders a footer that contains a div with the text "2020", thereby fulfilling the requirement.
