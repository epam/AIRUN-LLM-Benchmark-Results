## Run 1:
### Thoughts:
We are going to create a React application with TypeScript. We'll use functional components and hooks.

Steps:
1. Set up a new React project with TypeScript: `npx create-react-app virtual-piano --template typescript`
2. Replace the default files with our code.

We'll create the following components:
- App: The main component
- Piano: The piano component that contains the keys and handles the display (notes/letters)
- PianoKey: A single piano key (both white and black)
- ToggleButton: The button to toggle between notes and letters
- FullscreenButton: The button to toggle fullscreen

We'll also:
- Create an interface for the sound mapping.
- Use useState, useEffect, and useRef hooks to manage state and side effects.

Let's break down the migration:

1. Audio Handling:
   - We'll create a SoundMap interface and an object that maps note names to Audio objects.
   - We need to preload the audio? The original code creates Audio objects on load. We can do the same in a useEffect.

2. State:
   - We need state for the active keys (to show which key is pressed). We can store an array of active note names.
   - We need state for the current view mode: 'notes' or 'letters'

3. Event Handling:
   - We'll handle mouse events on individual PianoKey components.
   - For keyboard events, we'll attach event listeners to the document (in a useEffect) and clean them up.

4. Fullscreen: We'll use the browser's fullscreen API, and we'll manage the state of fullscreen with a ref or state? We don't need to re-render when fullscreen changes, so we can use a ref to track it? Actually, we don't need to track it in state because we don't need to re-render. We can just use the document's fullscreenElement.

5. CSS: We'll copy the existing CSS into a new file and import it.

Let's create the files:

- src/index.tsx: The entry point (we can keep the default one)
- src/App.tsx: The main App component
- src/components/Piano.tsx
- src/components/PianoKey.tsx
- src/components/ToggleButton.tsx
- src/components/FullscreenButton.tsx
- src/assets: copy the audio and icon files from the original project
- src/css/style.css: copy the existing CSS

Now, let's write the code step by step.

First, we'll create the SoundMap interface and the sound mapping object.

Note: We have to import the audio files. We can use `require` or import, but since we are using TypeScript, we can also use a workaround for the audio files.

Alternatively, we can use the public folder. We'll put the assets in the public folder and reference them by absolute path.

But in the original, the audio files are in `./assets/audio/`. We can put them in the public folder: `public/assets/audio/`.

Then, we can create the soundMapper in a useEffect? Actually, we can create it once when the component mounts. But note: we cannot create the Audio objects during the initial render because they would be recreated on every render. We can use useRef to store the soundMapper and initialize it once.

Alternatively, we can create the soundMapper outside the component if it doesn't change.

But note: the original code uses relative paths. We can put the assets in the public folder and use the same structure.

Let's plan the components:

App Component:
- State:
   - `activeNotes`: string[] (the notes that are currently active, to show the active state)
   - `viewMode`: 'notes' | 'letters'
- Handlers:
   - `handleKeyDown`: for keyboard events
   - `handleKeyUp`: for keyboard events
   - `handleMouseDown`: for piano keys
   - `handleMouseUp`: for piano keys
   - `handleMouseLeave`: for piano keys? Or we can handle it at the key level.
   - `toggleViewMode`: to switch between notes and letters
   - `toggleFullscreen`: to toggle fullscreen

We'll use useEffect to attach and detach the keyboard event listeners.

Piano Component:
- Props:
   - `activeNotes`: string[] (to highlight active keys)
   - `viewMode`: 'notes' | 'letters'
   - `onMouseDown`: (note: string, event: React.MouseEvent) => void
   - `onMouseUp`: (note: string, event: React.MouseEvent) => void
   - `onMouseLeave`?: (note: string, event: React.MouseEvent) => void
   - `onMouseMove`?: (event: React.MouseEvent) => void

The Piano component will render the keys. We'll map over the keys configuration.

We'll create a configuration for the keys to avoid hardcoding in the JSX.

Key Configuration:

We have:
- White keys: D, F, G, H, J, K, L (with notes: c, d, e, f, g, a, b)
- Black keys: R, T, U, I, O (with notes: c♯, d♯, f♯, g♯, a♯) and one empty (none)

We can create an array of objects for the keys:

const whiteKeys = [
  { letter: 'D', note: 'c' },
  { letter: 'F', note: 'd' },
  ... etc.
]

const blackKeys = [
  { letter: 'R', note: 'c♯' },
  { letter: 'T', note: 'd♯' },
  { letter: 'U', note: 'f♯' },
  ... and one empty: { letter: '', note: '', isNone: true }
]

But note: the original HTML has a specific structure. We'll have to replicate the structure.

Alternatively, we can create a flat array of all keys (both white and black) and then render them in the correct structure? But the black keys are positioned absolutely in a container.

We'll keep the structure: a container for white keys and a container for black keys (with class "keys-sharp").

So, we'll create:

- WhiteKeys: map over whiteKeys and render PianoKey components (with class "piano-key")
- BlackKeys: map over blackKeys and render PianoKey components (with class "piano-key sharp", and if it's none, then add "none" class and don't render the inner content)

PianoKey Component:
- Props:
   - letter: string
   - note: string
   - isActive: boolean (computed from activeNotes in the parent)
   - viewMode: 'notes' | 'letters'
   - isNone?: boolean (for the empty black key)
   - onMouseDown: (event: React.MouseEvent) => void
   - onMouseUp: (event: React.MouseEvent) => void
   - onMouseLeave: (event: React.MouseEvent) => void

The PianoKey will render a div with the appropriate classes and data attributes.

We'll also handle the mouse events and call the parent handlers with the note.

But note: the original also handles mouse move with button pressed. We can handle that at the Piano level by passing onMouseMove to the container and then when the mouse moves and a button is pressed, we can trigger the play.

Alternatively, we can handle it at the PianoKey level? But the mouse move might be over multiple keys.

We'll do as the original: the piano element has a mousemove event that checks if the left button is pressed and then triggers play.

So, we'll pass an onMouseMove handler to the piano container.

Now, let's code:

We'll start by creating the App component.

We'll use:
- useState for activeNotes and viewMode
- useRef for the soundMapper (so we don't recreate it on every render) and for the fullscreen state? Actually, we don't need ref for fullscreen because we are going to use the document API.

But for the soundMapper, we can create it once and store it in a ref.

Alternatively, we can create it outside the component because it doesn't change and doesn't depend on the component state.

We can do:

const soundMapper: Record<string, HTMLAudioElement> = {
  c: new Audio(process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/assets/audio/a.mp3'),
  ... etc.
}

But note: the original audio file for 'c' is named 'a.mp3'. We have to check the file names.

Alternatively, we can use the same file names as in the original.

But in the original, the note 'c' uses a.mp3? That might be a mistake? Actually, the original project might have a different mapping. We have to preserve the original behavior.

We'll use the same file names as in the original.

We'll create the soundMapper object at the top level (outside the component) because it doesn't change.

But note: we are in a React component, and we don't want to create the Audio objects until the component is mounted? Actually, it's safe to create them at the top level because they are just objects and don't depend on the DOM.

So:

const SOUND_MAPPER: Record<string, HTMLAudioElement> = {
  c: new Audio('/assets/audio/a.mp3'),
  d: new Audio('/assets/audio/d.mp3'),
  e: new Audio('/assets/audio/e.mp3'),
  f: new Audio('/assets/audio/f.mp3'),
  g: new Audio('/assets/audio/g.mp3'),
  a: new Audio('/assets/audio/a.mp3'),
  b: new Audio('/assets/audio/b.mp3'),
  'c♯': new Audio('/assets/audio/c♯.mp3'),
  'd♯': new Audio('/assets/audio/d♯.mp3'),
  'f♯': new Audio('/assets/audio/f♯.mp3'),
  'g♯': new Audio('/assets/audio/g♯.mp3'),
  'a♯': new Audio('/assets/audio/a♯.mp3'),
};

But note: the public URL in a React app is the root. So we put the assets in the public folder: public/assets/...

Now, the App component:

We'll have:
- state for activeNotes: string[] (initially empty)
- state for viewMode: 'notes' | 'letters' (initially 'notes')

We'll create handlers for:
- handlePlay: (note: string) => void
   This function will:
   - Check if the note is already active (to avoid re-triggering the same note while it's active) -> we are using activeNotes to track.
   - If it's not active, then:
        - Add the note to activeNotes
        - Play the sound: SOUND_MAPPER[note].currentTime = 0; SOUND_MAPPER[note].play();
   But note: the original also adds a class to the key. We are going to handle the class via the activeNotes state and pass it to the PianoKey.

- handleReset: (note: string) => void
   - Remove the note from activeNotes

But we also have to handle the case when the same note is played multiple times without being released? The original uses an array `played` to avoid playing the same note again until it's released. We are using activeNotes for that.

Now, for the events:

Keyboard events:
- We'll attach event listeners to the document for 'keydown' and 'keyup'

We'll do that in a useEffect:

useEffect(() => {
  const handleKeyDown = (event: KeyboardEvent) => {
    // Find the key by event.key (converted to uppercase) and then get the note
    // Then call handlePlay with that note
  }

  const handleKeyUp = (event: KeyboardEvent) => {
    // Similarly, call handleReset with the note
  }

  document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
  document.addEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp);

  return () => {
    document.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
    document.removeEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp);
  };
}, []);

But note: the original also has mouse events. We'll handle the mouse events at the Piano and PianoKey level.

For the mouse events on the PianoKey, we'll pass the note to the handlers.

We'll create:

- handleMouseDown: (note: string) => void -> which will call handlePlay(note)
- handleMouseUp: (note: string) => void -> which will call handleReset(note)
- handleMouseLeave: (note: string) => void -> which will call handleReset(note) (same as handleMouseUp)

But note: the original also has a mousemove event on the piano container that triggers play if the mouse is moving with the button pressed. We'll create:

- handleMouseMove: (event: React.MouseEvent) => {
      if (event.buttons === 1) {
          // We need to find the key element under the mouse and get its note
          // How? We can use event.target and check if it's a piano key? But in React, we can't rely on the DOM directly.

          // Alternatively, we can use the same method as the original: event.target might be the key or a child? We can use event.currentTarget to get the piano container and then use document.elementFromPoint to get the element at the mouse position? But that is not the React way.

          // We can change the design: when the mouse moves and the button is down, we can set the active key based on the element under the mouse. But we don't have a direct way.

          // Alternatively, we can attach the mousemove event to each key? But that would be inefficient.

          // Let's reconsider: the original code uses:
          //   piano.addEventListener('mousemove', (event) => {
          //       if (event.buttons === 1) {
          //           play(event)
          //       }
          //   })
          // And the play function uses event.target to get the piano key.

          // We can do the same: in the Piano component, we can have an onMouseMove handler that, if the left button is pressed, then we call a function to play the key under the mouse.

          // How to get the key under the mouse? We can use the event's currentTarget (the piano container) and then use event.nativeEvent.offsetX and offsetY? But the keys are positioned absolutely? Actually, the piano container is relative and the keys are absolute.

          // Alternatively, we can use the event target? But the event target might be a child element.

          // We can do: event.target.closest('.piano-key') to get the key element.

          // But in React, we are not supposed to use the DOM directly. We can use a ref to the piano container and then use the event to get the element under the mouse.

          // However, we are already in a React event, so we can use event.nativeEvent to get the native event and then use the target from that.

          // Let's try: event.nativeEvent.target gives the actual DOM element. Then we can use .closest to find the piano key.

          // We'll do this in the Piano component and then call a function passed from the App to play the note of that key.

          // We'll pass a function from App to Piano: onMouseMoveDuringPlay
      }
  }

We'll implement this in the Piano component.

We'll create a function in App: `handleMouseMoveDuringPlay` that takes a note and then calls handlePlay for that note, but only if the note is not already active? Actually, we want to play the note when the mouse moves over a new key while the button is down. We can do:

  handleMouseMoveDuringPlay = (event: React.MouseEvent) => {
    if (event.buttons !== 1) return;

    // Get the element under the mouse from the native event
    const target = event.nativeEvent.target as Element;
    const pianoKeyEl = target.closest('.piano-key');
    if (!pianoKeyEl) return;

    const note = pianoKeyEl.getAttribute('data-note');
    if (!note) return;

    // Check if this note is already active? We don't want to retrigger the same note.
    // But the original doesn't check? It uses an array `played` to avoid playing the same note until it's released. We are using activeNotes for that.

    // So, if the note is not in activeNotes, then we play it.
    if (!activeNotes.includes(note)) {
        handlePlay(note);
    }
  }

But note: the original code does not check for the same note? Actually, it does: `if (!note || played.includes(note)) return;`

So we are doing the same.

But we have to be cautious: the note might be the same as the one that is already active? We are checking in handlePlay: if the note is in activeNotes, we skip. So we can call handlePlay and it will skip.

But note: the original also adds the class and pushes to the played array. We are doing the same via handlePlay.

So we can call handlePlay(note) and it will handle the rest.

But we have to be careful: the handlePlay function is defined in the App and it uses the state setter for activeNotes. We have to use the current activeNotes to check? We can use a state setter with a callback to get the latest state? Or we can use a ref for activeNotes? Alternatively, we can check the note against the current activeNotes in the handlePlay function.

We'll design handlePlay to be:

const handlePlay = useCallback((note: string) => {
  // If the note is already active, do nothing
  if (activeNotes.includes(note)) {
    return;
  }

  // Play the sound
  const sound = SOUND_MAPPER[note];
  if (sound) {
    sound.currentTime = 0;
    sound.play();
  }

  // Update activeNotes
  setActiveNotes(prev => [...prev, note]);
}, [activeNotes]); // But note: this dependency might cause the callback to change. We can use the functional update to avoid depending on activeNotes.

Actually, we can do:

const handlePlay = useCallback((note: string) => {
  setActiveNotes(prev => {
    if (prev.includes(note)) {
      return prev;
    }
    const sound = SOUND_MAPPER[note];
    if (sound) {
      sound.currentTime = 0;
      sound.play();
    }
    return [...prev, note];
  });
}, []); // No dependencies because setActiveNotes is stable and SOUND_MAPPER is constant.

Similarly, handleReset:

const handleReset = useCallback((note: string) => {
  setActiveNotes(prev => prev.filter(n => n !== note));
}, []);

Now, for the view mode toggle:

We'll have a function to toggle the view mode:

const toggleViewMode = (newMode: 'notes' | 'letters') => {
  setViewMode(newMode);
}

We'll pass this to the ToggleButton component.

Now, the FullscreenButton:

We'll create a function to toggle fullscreen:

const toggleFullscreen = () => {
  if (!document.fullscreenElement) {
    document.documentElement.requestFullscreen();
  } else {
    document.exitFullscreen();
  }
}

We'll put this in the FullscreenButton component? Or we can pass it as a prop? Actually, we can have a separate component for the fullscreen button that uses this function.

But the function is the same for every instance, so we can define it in the App and pass it as a prop? Or we can define it inside the FullscreenButton component? It doesn't depend on the App state, so we can define it inside the FullscreenButton.

But to keep the structure, we'll create a FullscreenButton component that has an onClick handler that calls the fullscreen function.

Now, let's code the components.

We'll start with the App component.

We'll also create the key configurations.

We'll define:

const WHITE_KEYS = [
  { letter: 'D', note: 'c' },
  { letter: 'F', note: 'd' },
  { letter: 'G', note: 'e' },
  { letter: 'H', note: 'f' },
  { letter: 'J', note: 'g' },
  { letter: 'K', note: 'a' },
  { letter: 'L', note: 'b' },
];

const BLACK_KEYS = [
  { letter: 'R', note: 'c♯' },
  { letter: 'T', note: 'd♯' },
  null, // for the gap
  { letter: 'U', note: 'f♯' },
  { letter: 'I', note: 'g♯' },
  { letter: 'O', note: 'a♯' },
];

Now, the Piano component will receive:
- activeNotes: string[]
- viewMode: 'notes' | 'letters'
- onMouseDown: (note: string) => void
- onMouseUp: (note: string) => void
- onMouseLeave: (note: string) => void
- onMouseMove: (event: React.MouseEvent) => void

We'll pass onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseLeave to each PianoKey.

For the Piano container, we'll attach the onMouseMove event.

We'll also conditionally add the class 'letters' to the piano container when viewMode is 'letters'.

Now, let's code each component.

Note: We are using TypeScript, so we'll define types for the props.

Let's start with the PianoKey component.

PianoKeyProps:
- letter: string
- note: string
- isActive: boolean
- viewMode: 'notes' | 'letters'
- isNone?: boolean (optional, for the empty black key)
- onMouseDown: (event: React.MouseEvent) => void
- onMouseUp: (event: React.MouseEvent) => void
- onMouseLeave: (event: React.MouseEvent) => void

We'll also add data attributes for the note and letter? We need them for the mousemove event to get the note from the DOM? Actually, we are going to use the note from the props in the event handlers. But for the mousemove event in the piano container, we are using the DOM to get the note. So we have to set the data attributes.

We'll set:
  data-letter={letter}
  data-note={note}

But if the key is none, we don't set these.

We'll conditionally render the inner content: if it's not none, then we show the letter or note based on viewMode.

The classes: 
- 'piano-key'
- 'sharp' for black keys (we'll get that from the parent? Actually, the parent will pass a prop for isSharp? Or we can have two types of keys: white and black? We'll let the parent set the className.

We'll design: the parent (Piano) will pass the className to the PianoKey. The PianoKey will have:
  className={`piano-key ${isSharp ? 'sharp' : ''} ${isNone ? 'none' : ''} ${isActive ? 'piano-key-active' : ''}`}

But wait: the active class is also conditionally added.

Actually, we are getting isActive as a prop.

So:

const PianoKey: React.FC<PianoKeyProps> = ({ 
  letter, 
  note, 
  isActive, 
  viewMode, 
  isNone, 
  onMouseDown, 
  onMouseUp, 
  onMouseLeave 
}) => {
  return (
    <div
      className={`piano-key ${isNone ? 'none' : ''} ${isActive ? 'piano-key-active' : ''}`}
      data-letter={isNone ? undefined : letter}
      data-note={isNone ? undefined : note}
      onMouseDown={onMouseDown}
      onMouseUp={onMouseUp}
      onMouseLeave={onMouseLeave}
    >
      {!isNone && (
        <span>{viewMode === 'notes' ? note : letter}</span>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

But note: the black keys have an additional class 'sharp'. We are not passing that. We should add a prop for isSharp? Or the parent can pass the className? We'll let the parent set the className.

We'll change: the parent (Piano) will pass a className prop to the PianoKey that includes 'piano-key' and 'sharp' for black keys. And then we add the conditionals.

Alternatively, we can have the parent compose the className.

We'll do:

In the Piano component, for a white key: className = "piano-key"
For a black key: className = "piano-key sharp"

And then conditionally add 'none' and 'piano-key-active'.

So we'll pass a `className` prop to the PianoKey.

We'll adjust the props for PianoKey to include className.

PianoKeyProps:
  ... 
  className: string

Then:

const PianoKey: React.FC<PianoKeyProps> = ({ 
  className, 
  ... 
}) => {
  return (
    <div
      className={`${className} ${isNone ? 'none' : ''} ${isActive ? 'piano-key-active' : ''}`}
      ... 
    >
      ...
    </div>
  );
};

But note: the active class is 'piano-key-active'. We are conditionally adding it.

Now, the Piano component:

We'll map over the white keys and black keys.

We'll pass to the white keys:
  className="piano-key"
  ... other props

To the black keys:
  className="piano-key sharp"

And for the empty black key, we set isNone.

We'll also attach the onMouseMove event to the piano container.

Now, let's code the App component.

We'll structure the App component:

return (
  <div className="App">
    <header className="header">
      <h1 className="header-title">Virtual Piano</h1>
    </header>
    <main className="main">
      <div className="btn-container">
        <ToggleButton ... />
      </div>
      <Piano ... />
      <FullscreenButton onClick={toggleFullscreen} />
    </main>
    <footer className="footer">
      <div className="footer-container">
        2020
      </div>
    </footer>
  </div>
)

We'll create the ToggleButton and FullscreenButton components.

ToggleButton: two buttons, one for notes and one for letters.

Props:
  currentMode: 'notes' | 'letters'
  onToggle: (newMode: 'notes' | 'letters') => void

We'll have:

const ToggleButton: React.FC<{ currentMode: string, onToggle: (mode: 'notes' | 'letters') => void }> = ({ currentMode, onToggle }) => {
  return (
    <div className="btn-container">
      <button 
        className={`btn btn-notes ${currentMode === 'notes' ? 'btn-active' : ''}`}
        onClick={() => onToggle('notes')}
      >
        Notes
      </button>
      <button 
        className={`btn btn-letters ${currentMode === 'letters' ? 'btn-active' : ''}`}
        onClick={() => onToggle('letters')}
      >
        Letters
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

FullscreenButton:

const FullscreenButton: React.FC<{ onClick: () => void }> = ({ onClick }) => {
  return (
    <button className="fullscreen openfullscreen" onClick={onClick}></button>
  );
};

Now, we have to implement the mousemove event in the Piano component that triggers the onMouseMoveDuringPlay (passed from App) when the mouse moves and the left button is pressed.

We'll pass a prop to Piano: onMouseMoveDuringPlay: (event: React.MouseEvent) => void

And in the Piano component:

<div 
  className={`piano ${viewMode === 'letters' ? 'letters' : ''}`} 
  onMouseMove={onMouseMoveDuringPlay}
>
  ... white keys and black keys
</div>

We'll also attach the mouse events to the keys? Actually, we are passing the mouse down/up/leave to each key.

But note: the original also has mouseout on the piano key. We are handling mouseleave on the key.

Now, we have to connect the key events to the handlers from the App.

In the PianoKey, when the mouse down event happens, we call the onMouseDown handler from the parent (Piano) and the parent will call the App's handlePlay.

We'll design:

In the Piano component, for each key we pass:

onMouseDown={() => onKeyMouseDown(note)}   // but note: the note might be undefined for the empty key? We skip.

But we have to pass the event? Actually, the App's handlePlay only needs the note.

We can do:

const handleKeyMouseDown = (note: string) => {
  onMouseDown(note);
}

But wait: the App's handlePlay function is defined to take a note and then play it. We don't need the event.

Similarly for mouse up and leave.

So we can pass:

onMouseDown={() => onMouseDown(note)}
onMouseUp={() => onMouseUp(note)}
onMouseLeave={() => onMouseLeave(note)}

But note: the mouseleave event might be triggered even when the note is not active? We should only reset if the note is active? Actually, the App's handleReset will just remove the note from activeNotes, and if it's not there, it's a no-op.

So it's safe.

Now, let's code the components.

We'll start with the App component.

We'll also copy the CSS from the original to src/css/style.css and import it in the App.

In the App.tsx:

import './css/style.css';

We'll also preload the audio? We don't have to, because the Audio objects are created and they will load when played.

But we can preload them? We can set preload="auto" but that is done when we create the Audio object.

Alternatively, we can call .load() on each audio element. We can do that in a useEffect.

But it's optional. The original doesn't preload.

Now, let's code the App component.

We'll use:

const [activeNotes, setActiveNotes] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [viewMode, setViewMode] = useState<'notes' | 'letters'>('notes');

const handlePlay = useCallback((note: string) => {
  setActiveNotes(prev => {
    if (prev.includes(note)) {
      return prev;
    }
    const sound = SOUND_MAPPER[note];
    if (sound) {
      sound.currentTime = 0;
      sound.play();
    }
    return [...prev, note];
  });
}, []);

const handleReset = useCallback((note: string) => {
  setActiveNotes(prev => prev.filter(n => n !== note));
}, []);

// For the mousemove during play
const handleMouseMoveDuringPlay = useCallback((event: React.MouseEvent) => {
  if (event.buttons !== 1) return;

  const target = event.nativeEvent.target as Element;
  const pianoKeyEl = target.closest('.piano-key');
  if (!pianoKeyEl) return;

  const note = pianoKeyEl.getAttribute('data-note');
  if (!note) return;

  // Check if the note is already active? We'll let handlePlay check that.
  handlePlay(note);
}, [handlePlay]); // handlePlay is stable because it's useCallback with no dependencies.

But note: handlePlay is defined with useCallback and has no dependencies, so it's stable.

Now, the keyboard event effect:

useEffect(() => {
  const handleKeyDown = (event: KeyboardEvent) => {
    // Find the key by the key pressed: event.key (uppercase)
    // We have to map the key to a note? We have the key configuration.

    // We can create a mapping from letter to note? But note: the same letter might appear in multiple octaves? In our case, each letter is unique.

    // We'll create a map: letter -> note
    // We can build it from the WHITE_KEYS and BLACK_KEYS.

    // But we can precompute a letterToNoteMap.

    // We'll do it outside the component.

    const letter = event.key.toUpperCase();
    const keyConfig = [...WHITE_KEYS, ...BLACK_KEYS.filter(key => key !== null) as Array<{letter: string, note: string}>].find(key => key.letter === letter);
    if (keyConfig) {
      handlePlay(keyConfig.note);
    }
  };

  const handleKeyUp = (event: KeyboardEvent) => {
    const letter = event.key.toUpperCase();
    const keyConfig = [...WHITE_KEYS, ...BLACK_KEYS.filter(key => key !== null) as Array<{letter: string, note: string}>].find(key => key.letter === letter);
    if (keyConfig) {
      handleReset(keyConfig.note);
    }
  };

  document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
  document.addEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp);

  return () => {
    document.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
    document.removeEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp);
  };
}, [handlePlay, handleReset]);

But note: the handlePlay and handleReset are dependencies. They are stable, so it's safe.

We'll precompute the letterToNoteMap? Actually, we are iterating over the keys every time. It's a small array, so it's acceptable.

Now, the Piano component:

We'll pass:
  activeNotes={activeNotes}
  viewMode={viewMode}
  onMouseDown={handlePlay}
  onMouseUp={handleReset}
  onMouseLeave={handleReset}
  onMouseMoveDuringPlay={handleMouseMoveDuringPlay}

In the Piano component, we'll:

- Map over WHITE_KEYS to render PianoKey for each white key.
- Map over BLACK_KEYS to render PianoKey for each black key (including the null for the gap).

For the black keys, we'll have a container with class "keys-sharp".

We'll also conditionally add the class 'letters' to the piano container based on viewMode.

Now, let's code the Piano component.

We'll define the props:

interface PianoProps {
  activeNotes: string[];
  viewMode: 'notes' | 'letters';
  onMouseDown: (note: string) => void;
  onMouseUp: (note: string) => void;
  onMouseLeave: (note: string) => void;
  onMouseMoveDuringPlay: (event: React.MouseEvent) => void;
}

Then:

export const Piano: React.FC<PianoProps> = ({
  activeNotes,
  viewMode,
  onMouseDown,
  onMouseUp,
  onMouseLeave,
  onMouseMoveDuringPlay
}) => {
  return (
    <div 
      className={`piano ${viewMode === 'letters' ? 'letters' : ''}`} 
      onMouseMove={onMouseMoveDuringPlay}
    >
      <div className="white-keys">
        {WHITE_KEYS.map(key => (
          <PianoKey
            key={key.note}
            className="piano-key"
            letter={key.letter}
            note={key.note}
            isActive={activeNotes.includes(key.note)}
            viewMode={viewMode}
            onMouseDown={() => onMouseDown(key.note)}
            onMouseUp={() => onMouseUp(key.note)}
            onMouseLeave={() => onMouseLeave(key.note)}
          />
        ))}
      </div>
      <div className="keys-sharp">
        {BLACK_KEYS.map((key, index) => {
          if (key === null) {
            return <PianoKey 
              key={`none-${index}`}
              className="piano-key sharp"
              isNone={true}
              letter=""
              note=""
              isActive={false}
              viewMode={viewMode}
              onMouseDown={() => {}}
              onMouseUp={() => {}}
              onMouseLeave={() => {}}
            />
          }
          return (
            <PianoKey
              key={key.note}
              className="piano-key sharp"
              letter={key.letter}
              note={key.note}
              isActive={activeNotes.includes(key.note)}
              viewMode={viewMode}
              onMouseDown={() => onMouseDown(key.note)}
              onMouseUp={() => onMouseUp(key.note)}
              onMouseLeave={() => onMouseLeave(key.note)}
            />
          );
        })}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

Note: we added a container for white keys? The original didn't have a container for white keys. The original structure:

<div class="piano">
  <div class="piano-key" ...> ... </div> (7 white keys)
  <div class="keys-sharp"> ... </div> (6 black keys, one of which is none)
</div>

So we don't need a white-keys container. We can just put the white keys as siblings of keys-sharp.

But the original has the white keys and then the keys-sharp container. We'll do:

<div className="piano ...">
  {WHITE_KEYS.map(...)}
  <div className="keys-sharp">
    {BLACK_KEYS.map(...)}
  </div>
</div>

But the CSS expects the white keys to be direct children? We have to check the CSS.

Alternatively, we can adjust the CSS if needed. But to preserve the original structure, we'll not wrap the white keys.

So:

<div className={`piano ...`}>
  {WHITE_KEYS.map(key => (
    <PianoKey ... />
  ))}
  <div className="keys-sharp">
    {BLACK_KEYS.map(...)}
  </div>
</div>

But note: the white keys are now 7 divs and then a div.keys-sharp. That matches the original.

Now, we have to copy the CSS from the original to src/css/style.css.

We'll also copy the assets (audio files and the favicon) to the public folder.

We'll create:
  public/assets/audio/ with all the audio files
  public/assets/piano.ico

And update the index.html to include the favicon? Actually, we can update the public/index.html to include the favicon.

But we are using the same index.html? We'll adjust.

In the public/index.html, we'll add:

<link rel="shortcut icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/assets/piano.ico" />

And the fonts? We can copy the link tags.

But we are already including the style.css? We'll import the CSS in the App.

We'll also include the fonts in the public/index.html.

Now, let's write the code.

Due to the complexity, we'll write the code in multiple files.

We'll create:

src/App.tsx
src/components/Piano.tsx
src/components/PianoKey.tsx
src/components/ToggleButton.tsx
src/components/FullscreenButton.tsx
src/css/style.css

And we'll define the WHITE_KEYS and BLACK_KEYS in a separate constants file? Or in the Piano.tsx? We'll put them in Piano.tsx for now.

Let's start with the constants:

In Piano.tsx:

const WHITE_KEYS = [
  { letter: 'D', note: 'c' },
  { letter: 'F', note: 'd' },
  { letter: 'G', note: 'e' },
  { letter: 'H', note: 'f' },
  { letter: 'J', note: 'g' },
  { letter: 'K', note: 'a' },
  { letter: 'L', note: 'b' },
];

const BLACK_KEYS = [
  { letter: 'R', note: 'c♯' },
  { letter: 'T', note: 'd♯' },
  null,
  { letter: 'U', note: 'f♯' },
  { letter: 'I', note: 'g♯' },
  { letter: 'O', note: 'a♯' },
];

But note: the original has 7 white keys and 6 black keys (with one gap). So the BLACK_KEYS array has 6 elements.

Now, we'll code each component.

We'll also create the soundMapper in a separate file? Or in App.tsx? We'll put it in App.tsx.

But note: we are using TypeScript, so we have to define the type for the soundMapper.

We'll do:

const SOUND_MAPPER: Record<string, HTMLAudioElement> = {
  c: new Audio(process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/assets/audio/a.mp3'),
  // ... etc.
};

But note: the original file for 'c' is named 'a.mp3'. We are using the same.

We'll write the entire App.tsx.

Due to the length, we'll break it down.

We'll also use useCallback for the event handlers to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

Let's code step by step.

We'll start with the App component.

Note: We are using React 18 and TypeScript.

We'll also use useRef for the soundMapper? We don't need to, because it's constant.

But we are creating the Audio objects at the top level? That's fine.

Now, let's write the code.

We'll create the files.

Due to the character limit, I'll provide the code for the main files.

First, the App.tsx:

### Answer:
I'll help you migrate this vanilla JavaScript piano application to React 18 with TypeScript. Here's the complete solution:

### Step-by-Step Migration Plan:

1. **Project Structure**:
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Piano.tsx
│   ├── PianoKey.tsx
│   ├── ToggleButton.tsx
│   └── FullscreenButton.tsx
├── hooks/
│   └── useAudio.ts
├── assets/
│   └── audio/ (copy original audio files here)
├── App.tsx
├── index.tsx
└── styles.css (copy original CSS here)
```

2. **TypeScript Interfaces**:
```typescript
// types.ts
export interface PianoKeyConfig {
  letter: string;
  note: string;
  isSharp?: boolean;
  isNone?: boolean;
}

export type ViewMode = 'notes' | 'letters';
```

3. **Audio Hook**:
```tsx
// hooks/useAudio.ts
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

const SOUND_MAP: Record<string, string> = {
  c: '/assets/audio/a.mp3',
  d: '/assets/audio/d.mp3',
  e: '/assets/audio/e.mp3',
  f: '/assets/audio/f.mp3',
  g: '/assets/audio/g.mp3',
  a: '/assets/audio/a.mp3',
  b: '/assets/audio/b.mp3',
  'c♯': '/assets/audio/c♯.mp3',
  'd♯': '/assets/audio/d♯.mp3',
  'f♯': '/assets/audio/f♯.mp3',
  'g♯': '/assets/audio/g♯.mp3',
  'a♯': '/assets/audio/a♯.mp3',
};

export const useAudio = () => {
  const audioRefs = useRef<Record<string, HTMLAudioElement>>({});

  useEffect(() => {
    // Preload audio
    Object.entries(SOUND_MAP).forEach(([note, src]) => {
      const audio = new Audio(src);
      audio.preload = 'auto';
      audioRefs.current[note] = audio;
    });
  }, []);

  const play = (note: string) => {
    const audio = audioRefs.current[note];
    if (audio) {
      audio.currentTime = 0;
      audio.play().catch(e => console.error('Audio play failed:', e));
    }
  };

  return { play };
};
```

4. **PianoKey Component**:
```tsx
// components/PianoKey.tsx
import React, { memo } from 'react';
import { PianoKeyConfig, ViewMode } from '../types';

interface PianoKeyProps extends PianoKeyConfig {
  isActive: boolean;
  viewMode: ViewMode;
  onMouseDown: () => void;
  onMouseUp: () => void;
  onMouseLeave: () => void;
}

const PianoKey: React.FC<PianoKeyProps> = memo(({
  letter,
  note,
  isSharp,
  isNone,
  isActive,
  viewMode,
  onMouseDown,
  onMouseUp,
  onMouseLeave
}) => {
  return (
    <div
      className={`piano-key ${isSharp ? 'sharp' : ''} ${isNone ? 'none' : ''} ${isActive ? 'piano-key-active' : ''}`}
      data-letter={isNone ? undefined : letter}
      data-note={isNone ? undefined : note}
      onMouseDown={onMouseDown}
      onMouseUp={onMouseUp}
      onMouseLeave={onMouseLeave}
    >
      {!isNone && (
        <span>{viewMode === 'notes' ? note : letter}</span>
      )}
    </div>
  );
});

export default PianoKey;
```

5. **Piano Component**:
```tsx
// components/Piano.tsx
import React, { useCallback } from 'react';
import PianoKey from './PianoKey';
import { ViewMode } from '../types';

const WHITE_KEYS = [
  { letter: 'D', note: 'c' },
  { letter: 'F', note: 'd' },
  { letter: 'G', note: 'e' },
  { letter: 'H', note: 'f' },
  { letter: 'J', note: 'g' },
  { letter: 'K', note: 'a' },
  { letter: 'L', note: 'b' },
];

const BLACK_KEYS = [
  { letter: 'R', note: 'c♯', isSharp: true },
  { letter: 'T', note: 'd♯', isSharp: true },
  { letter: '', note: '', isSharp: true, isNone: true },
  { letter: 'U', note: 'f♯', isSharp: true },
  { letter: 'I', note: 'g♯', isSharp: true },
  { letter: 'O', note: 'a♯', isSharp: true },
];

interface PianoProps {
  activeNotes: string[];
  viewMode: ViewMode;
  onPlay: (note: string) => void;
  onRelease: (note: string) => void;
}

const Piano: React.FC<PianoProps> = ({
  activeNotes,
  viewMode,
  onPlay,
  onRelease
}) => {
  const handleMouseMove = useCallback((e: React.MouseEvent) => {
    if (e.buttons === 1) {
      const target = e.target as HTMLElement;
      const keyElement = target.closest('.piano-key:not(.none)');
      if (keyElement) {
        const note = keyElement.getAttribute('data-note');
        if (note) onPlay(note);
      }
    }
  }, [onPlay]);

  return (
    <div 
      className={`piano ${viewMode === 'letters' ? 'letters' : ''}`}
      onMouseMove={handleMouseMove}
    >
      {WHITE_KEYS.map((key) => (
        <PianoKey
          key={key.note}
          {...key}
          isActive={activeNotes.includes(key.note)}
          viewMode={viewMode}
          onMouseDown={() => onPlay(key.note)}
          onMouseUp={() => onRelease(key.note)}
          onMouseLeave={() => onRelease(key.note)}
        />
      ))}
      <div className="keys-sharp">
        {BLACK_KEYS.map((key, index) => (
          <PianoKey
            key={`${key.note}-${index}`}
            {...key}
            isActive={activeNotes.includes(key.note)}
            viewMode={viewMode}
            onMouseDown={() => !key.isNone && onPlay(key.note)}
            onMouseUp={() => !key.isNone && onRelease(key.note)}
            onMouseLeave={() => !key.isNone && onRelease(key.note)}
          />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Piano;
```

6. **ToggleButton Component**:
```tsx
// components/ToggleButton.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { ViewMode } from '../types';

interface ToggleButtonProps {
  viewMode: ViewMode;
  onChange: (mode: ViewMode) => void;
}

const ToggleButton: React.FC<ToggleButtonProps> = ({ viewMode, onChange }) => {
  return (
    <div className="btn-container">
      <button
        className={`btn btn-notes ${viewMode === 'notes' ? 'btn-active' : ''}`}
        onClick={() => onChange('notes')}
      >
        Notes
      </button>
      <button
        className={`btn btn-letters ${viewMode === 'letters' ? 'btn-active' : ''}`}
        onClick={() => onChange('letters')}
      >
        Letters
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ToggleButton;
```

7. **FullscreenButton Component**:
```tsx
// components/FullscreenButton.tsx
import React from 'react';

const FullscreenButton: React.FC = () => {
  const toggleFullscreen = () => {
    if (!document.fullscreenElement) {
      document.documentElement.requestFullscreen();
    } else {
      document.exitFullscreen();
    }
  };

  return (
    <button 
      className="fullscreen openfullscreen" 
      onClick={toggleFullscreen}
    />
  );
};

export default FullscreenButton;
```

8. **App Component**:
```tsx
// App.tsx
import React, { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react';
import Piano from './components/Piano';
import ToggleButton from './components/ToggleButton';
import FullscreenButton from './components/FullscreenButton';
import { useAudio } from './hooks/useAudio';
import { ViewMode } from './types';
import './styles.css';

const App: React.FC = () => {
  const [activeNotes, setActiveNotes] = useState<string[]>([]);
  const [viewMode, setViewMode] = useState<ViewMode>('notes');
  const { play } = useAudio();

  const handlePlay = useCallback((note: string) => {
    if (!activeNotes.includes(note)) {
      setActiveNotes(prev => [...prev, note]);
      play(note);
    }
  }, [activeNotes, play]);

  const handleRelease = useCallback((note: string) => {
    setActiveNotes(prev => prev.filter(n => n !== note));
  }, []);

  // Keyboard event handling
  useEffect(() => {
    const keyMap: Record<string, string> = {
      'd': 'c',
      'f': 'd',
      'g': 'e',
      'h': 'f',
      'j': 'g',
      'k': 'a',
      'l': 'b',
      'r': 'c♯',
      't': 'd♯',
      'u': 'f♯',
      'i': 'g♯',
      'o': 'a♯',
    };

    const handleKeyDown = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
      const note = keyMap[e.key.toLowerCase()];
      if (note) handlePlay(note);
    };

    const handleKeyUp = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
      const note = keyMap[e.key.toLowerCase()];
      if (note) handleRelease(note);
    };

    document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
    document.addEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp);

    return () => {
      document.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
      document.removeEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp);
    };
  }, [handlePlay, handleRelease]);

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="header">
        <h1 className="header-title">Virtual Piano</h1>
      </header>
      <main className="main">
        <ToggleButton 
          viewMode={viewMode} 
          onChange={setViewMode} 
        />
        <Piano
          activeNotes={activeNotes}
          viewMode={viewMode}
          onPlay={handlePlay}
          onRelease={handleRelease}
        />
        <FullscreenButton />
      </main>
      <footer className="footer">
        <div className="footer-container">2020</div>
      </footer>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

9. **index.tsx**:
```tsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
  document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement
);

root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

10. **styles.css** (Copy original CSS with these additions):
```css
/* Add these to ensure proper layout */
.piano {
  position: relative;
  display: flex;
}

.keys-sharp {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  pointer-events: none;
}

.piano-key {
  position: relative;
  pointer-events: auto;
}
```

### Key Improvements:

1. **Type Safety**:
   - Strict TypeScript interfaces for all props and state
   - Enforced viewMode type ('notes' | 'letters')
   - PianoKeyConfig interface for key definitions

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Memoized PianoKey component with React.memo
   - Audio preloading and caching with useAudio hook
   - Callback hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders

3. **Event Handling**:
   - Consolidated mouse and keyboard events
   - Synthetic event handling for mouse interactions
   - Keyboard events attached to document

4. **Component Structure**:
   - Modular components with single responsibilities
   - Custom hook for audio management
   - Clear separation of concerns

5. **Fullscreen Handling**:
   - Browser-agnostic fullscreen API
   - Clean implementation without state dependencies

### Migration Notes:

1. Copy original CSS to `src/styles.css`
2. Place audio files in `public/assets/audio/`
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install react@18 react-dom@18 typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom
```

This implementation preserves all original functionality while leveraging React's component model and hooks for better maintainability and performance. The TypeScript typing ensures type safety throughout the application, and the custom audio hook manages audio resources efficiently.
