# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos
  
  The application includes a `Header.tsx` component that renders an `h1` with "todos" title and an input field with proper placeholder text. The input field is autofocused and handles key presses to create new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos
  
  The `Main.tsx` component correctly implements a main section with a toggle-all checkbox input and label. It also renders the `TodoList` component to display all todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button
  
  The `TodoItem.tsx` component properly implements each todo with a toggle checkbox, label to display the title, and a delete button with the "destroy" class.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode
  
  The `TodoItem.tsx` component includes the `onDoubleClick={handleEdit}` handler on the label element, which sets the editing state and prepares the input field for editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The application implements filtering through the Redux store with a `filter` state property and the `setFilter` action. The `Footer.tsx` component renders filter links and the `Main.tsx` component filters todos accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization
  
  The `Footer.tsx` component displays the active count and properly pluralizes "item" based on the count using a pluralize helper function.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter
  
  The `Footer.tsx` component includes filter links with proper URL hash routing and applies the "selected" class to the currently active filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist
  
  The `Footer.tsx` component conditionally renders the "Clear completed" button when the completed count is greater than 0.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter
  
  The `Header.tsx` component correctly handles the Enter key press event to create new todos using the `addTodo` action from Redux.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos
  
  The `TodoItem.tsx` component includes a checkbox that dispatches the `toggleTodo` action to toggle completion status when changed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once
  
  The `Main.tsx` component implements the toggle-all checkbox that dispatches the `toggleAll` action to set all todos to the same completion status.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management
  
  The `TodoItem.tsx` component handles editing mode with proper focus management using `useRef` and `useEffect` to focus the edit input when editing starts.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos
  
  The `TodoItem.tsx` component includes a delete button that dispatches the `deleteTodo` action when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos
  
  The `Footer.tsx` component includes a "Clear completed" button that dispatches the `clearCompleted` action to remove all completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status
  
  The `Main.tsx` component filters the todo list based on the current filter value from the Redux store, showing all, active, or completed todos as appropriate.
