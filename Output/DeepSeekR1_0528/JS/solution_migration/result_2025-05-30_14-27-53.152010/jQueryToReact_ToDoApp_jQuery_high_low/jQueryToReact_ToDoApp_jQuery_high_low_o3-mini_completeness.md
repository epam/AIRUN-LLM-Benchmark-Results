# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos  
  The Header component clearly renders an <h1> element displaying "todos" and includes an input field for adding new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos  
  The Main component renders a container with a toggle-all checkbox and conditionally displays the todo list via the TodoList component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button  
  The TodoItem component provides a checkbox for toggling completion, a label for the todo title, and a button (with class "destroy") for deletion.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode  
  In TodoItem, a double-click event on the label invokes the handleEdit function, which sets the component into an editing state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The filtering functionality is implemented using Redux state and is supported by the Footer component which provides links for All, Active, and Completed filters.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization  
  In the Footer component, the count of active todos is displayed along with a pluralization helper function that toggles between "item" and "items".

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter  
  The Footer component renders filter links and applies the class "selected" to the link corresponding to the active filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist  
  The Footer conditionally displays a "Clear completed" button when there is at least one completed todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter  
  In the Header component, an onKeyDown handler listens for the Enter key to submit a new todo when the input is non-empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos  
  Each TodoItem includes an onChange handler on the checkbox that dispatches an action to toggle the completion status.

  The Main component provides a toggle-all checkbox that dispatches a toggleAll action to update the completion status of all todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management  
  The TodoItem component manages editing state and uses a ref to set focus on the input field when a todo is being edited.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos  
  Each TodoItem renders a delete button that dispatches a deleteTodo action to remove the individual todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos  
  The Footer component includes functionality that dispatches a clearCompleted action to remove todos that are marked as completed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status
