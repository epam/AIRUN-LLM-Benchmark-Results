# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist
  
  The test suite includes a test case specifically for basic rendering with default props: `it('renders with default props', () => {...}`. This test verifies that the component renders correctly with a combobox role and the default "Select..." placeholder text.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present
  
  Test #6 specifically addresses keyboard navigation: `it('navigates options with keyboard', async () => {...}`. This test verifies arrow key navigation and Enter key selection. The test confirms that the focused option changes when the down arrow is pressed, and that the selection is made when Enter is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)
  
  Several tests verify mouse interactions. Test #3 verifies clicking to open the menu, Test #4 verifies clicking to select an option, and Test #11 verifies clicking the clear button. Touch events are also tested in Test #15.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior
  
  The test suite includes tests for both controlled (with value prop provided - Test #2) and uncontrolled behavior (without value prop - Test #1). Test #4 also demonstrates controlled behavior with the onChange prop.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values
  
  Test #4 verifies selection, Test #5 verifies multi-selection, and Test #11 specifically tests clearing functionality with the `isClearable` prop.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented
  
  Test #3 verifies menu opening on click, Test #20 verifies menu closing on blur, and Test #13 tests the aria-expanded attribute change when opening/closing the menu.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality
  
  Test #7 specifically tests search filtering: `it('filters options based on input', async () => {...}`. This test verifies that typing in the select input filters the options appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist
  
  Test #5 explicitly tests multi-select behavior: `it('handles multi-select', async () => {...}`. It verifies that multiple options can be selected and that the onChange callback is called appropriately for each selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility
  
  Test #13 explicitly tests accessibility attributes: `it('has proper accessibility attributes', async () => {...}`. It verifies aria-expanded, aria-controls, and aria-label attributes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested
  
  Test #18 explicitly tests the empty options case: `it('displays no options message', async () => {...}`. It verifies that a custom "no options" message is displayed when there are no options.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states
  
  Test #10 tests the loading state: `it('shows loading indicator', () => {...}`. Test #17 tests custom loading message. While there's no explicit error state test, the loading state coverage is thorough.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states
  
  Test #9 specifically tests the disabled state: `it('disables when isDisabled is true', () => {...}`. It verifies that the combobox has the aria-disabled attribute when the component is disabled.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance
  
  Test #16 mentions menu positioning and Test #17 mentions async loading, which are related to handling large option sets. However, there is no explicit test for large option sets or virtualization. The test suite mentions "implied via virtualization tests" in the description, but no actual test for large option sets is implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested
  
  Test #6 verifies focus management during keyboard navigation, and Test #20 tests blur behavior. These tests ensure that focus is managed correctly during interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering
  
  Test #1 verifies the default placeholder rendering ("Select..."), and Test #2 verifies rendering of a selected value.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations
  
  Test #12 tests custom components: `it('accepts custom components', () => {...}`. This test verifies that a custom Option component can be provided and renders correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)
  
  Test #4 and #5 test the onChange callback, ensuring it's called with the correct arguments. While onInputChange, onMenuOpen, and onMenuClose aren't explicitly tested, the onChange testing is thorough.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)
  
  Test #11 tests the clear indicator, Test #10 tests the loading indicator. While the dropdown indicator isn't explicitly tested, the other indicators are well covered.
