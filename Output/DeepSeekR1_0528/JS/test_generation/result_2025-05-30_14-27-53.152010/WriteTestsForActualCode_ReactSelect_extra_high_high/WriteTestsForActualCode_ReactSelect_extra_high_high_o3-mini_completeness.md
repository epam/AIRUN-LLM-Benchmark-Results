# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist  
  The test "renders with default props" is present and correctly verifies the default rendering of the component.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present  
  Although there is a test for keyboard navigation that checks the ArrowDown and Enter keys, tests for other navigation keys such as Tab and Escape are missing.

- **Fail** (95%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)  
  The suite covers mouse clicks extensively (opening menus, option selection, clearing selections), but there is no explicit test for hover interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior  
  The tests include scenarios with a provided value (controlled behavior) as well as ones relying on default props (uncontrolled behavior).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values  
  There are tests ensuring that option selection changes state (e.g., "selects an option" and "clears selected value"). While removal isnâ€™t explicitly separated, the multi-select and clear functionality cover the expected state transitions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented  
  The tests verify that the menu opens on click (and even closes on blur), confirming the implementation of menu open/close behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality  
  The "filters options based on input" test confirms that search filtering works as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist  
  The "handles multi-select" test specifically checks the multi-select functionality by simulating multiple option selections.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility  
  The "has proper accessibility attributes" test checks for ARIA attributes such as aria-expanded and aria-controls, supporting screen reader compatibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested  
  The "displays no options message" test demonstrates behavior when the options array is empty.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states  
  While the tests include coverage for loading (via loading indicators and custom loading messages), there are no tests addressing error states.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states  
  The "disables when isDisabled is true" test confirms that the disabled state is handled appropriately.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance  
  No tests are provided to assess performance with large option sets (e.g., virtualization or rendering many options).

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested  
  The keyboard navigation test touches on focus management (by checking that an option gains a "focused" class). However, additional explicit focus management tests (such as after blur or tab transitions) would provide a fuller validation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering  
  Both the default placeholder ("Select...") and the selected value are verified in the tests.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations  
  There is no test that specifically covers custom implementations of formatOptionLabel, even though custom component usage is tested.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)  
  The tests verify onChange callbacks in multiple scenarios, but do not cover other callback props such as onInputChange, onMenuOpen, or onMenuClose.

- **Fail** (90%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)  
  While there are tests for the clear functionality and loading indicators, there is no explicit test for the dropdown indicator. This leaves a gap in the indicator component verification.
