# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)  
  The test suite uses Jasmine for specifying tests and Karma for running them, which are both modern and widely accepted in the JavaScript community.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints  
  The tests spy on the REST service methods (e.g., REST.content, REST.contentRevisions) and create fake objects using jasmine.createSpyObj to simulate REST API endpoints, ensuring that external calls are mocked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation  
  The test suite consistently utilizes beforeEach to set up modules, dependencies, and spies, ensuring that each test starts with a clean state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls  
  The tests intercept REST API calls through spies and by returning promises with $q.resolve; this ensures that no real HTTP requests are made during test execution.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection  
  AngularJS dependency injection is properly used via the inject() function to obtain services like $rootScope, $controller, $q, and others needed for the tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations  
  The code returns promises using $q and applies changes using $scope.$apply(), ensuring that asynchronous operations are correctly resolved during the tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies  
  The tests make extensive use of jasmine spies and jasmine.createSpyObj for REST services, localStorage, and AngularJS services, which confirms a proper mocking strategy.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization  
  The test suite is well-organized using nested describe and it blocks, clearly demarcating test cases and their specific scopes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls  
  The suite includes tests for successful page creation, handling duplicate URL errors, missing type errors, and deletion functionality, thereby covering multiple possible outcomes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate  
  While the tests primarily target controller actions and AngularJS services, they effectively simulate user interactions by invoking scope methods (e.g., $scope.savePage, $scope.deletePage) that would be triggered by UI events.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage  
  Each test creates a new scope and uses beforeEach for setup. However, there are no explicit afterEach hooks. Although AngularJS testing patterns generally manage cleanup through dependency injection and scope isolation, the absence of explicit teardown steps slightly reduces confidence.  
  (Less than 100% because explicit afterEach hooks might further ensure no state leakage in more complex scenarios.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested  
  Test names such as "should update page type", "should generate URL from title", and "should handle duplicate URL error" provide clear and meaningful descriptions of what each test is verifying.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible  
  The tests check outcomes such as changes to scope variables, redirection paths, and broadcast events rather than internal workings of the functions, thereby focusing on observable behavior.
