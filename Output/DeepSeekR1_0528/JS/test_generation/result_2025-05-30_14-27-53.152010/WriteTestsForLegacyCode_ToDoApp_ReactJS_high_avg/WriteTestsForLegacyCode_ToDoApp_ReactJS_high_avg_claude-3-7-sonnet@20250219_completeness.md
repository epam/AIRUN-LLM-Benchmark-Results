# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering
- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos
- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos

    The provided app.test.tsx file does not include specific tests for clearing completed todos functionality. While there are tests for filtering and toggling todos, the clearCompleted function of the model is not being tested in the app component tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events
- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts
- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation
- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos
- **Fail** (95%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions

    While there is a test for the `inform` function in the todoModel.test.ts file, there does not appear to be a specific test for the `subscribe` function implementation. The subscribe function is mocked in the app tests, but its actual functionality is not tested directly in the todoModel tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx
- **Fail** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data

    While there are mock todo objects created within individual test files, there are no dedicated test fixtures for sample todo data that could be reused across test files. Good practice would include creating separate fixture files to maintain consistent test data across the test suite.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented

    The tests do not adequately test routing functionality with appropriate mocks. While there is a basic simulation of route change in the app.test.tsx file (by changing the `nowShowing` state), there are no comprehensive tests for the actual routing mechanism, such as testing URL changes or router integration.
