# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering  
  The test "renders header and input" in app.test.tsx confirms component rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos  
  The test "adds new todo on Enter key" in app.test.tsx confirms adding todos is tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos  
  The test "toggles all todos" in app.test.tsx verifies todo toggling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos  
  The test "filters todos by active status" in app.test.tsx covers filtering functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  There is no explicit test case in app.test.tsx that simulates clearing completed todos. Although this functionality is indirectly tested in the footer tests and model tests, the evaluation step specifically expects a test in the app.tsx file.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering  
  The test "renders todo item" in todoItem.test.tsx confirms that rendering is covered.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos  
  While the tests verify toggling (via checkbox) and editing (via double-click and the Enter key for saving), there is no explicit test for destroying a todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events  
  The test "saves edited text on Enter" in todoItem.test.tsx demonstrates handling of keyboard events.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts  
  The test "renders item count" in footer.test.tsx confirms that item counts are being rendered correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation  
  The test "highlights active filter" demonstrates that filter navigation is tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The test "triggers clear completed" in footer.test.tsx confirms the clear completed functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos  
  The tests cover adding, toggling (and clearing completed), as well as saving to localStorage via inform, but there is no explicit test for destroying a todo.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions  
  Although inform is indirectly tested (via saving to localStorage), there is no direct test verifying the subscribe functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The test "clears completed todos" confirms that the clearing functionality works as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation  
  The test "generates UUID" confirms the UUID functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality  
  The test "pluralizes words" confirms that the pluralization utility behaves correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations  
  The test "stores and retrieves data" confirms that localStorage operations are effectively covered.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function  
  The test "extends objects" verifies that the extend function behaves as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx  
  All test files use the proper naming conventions (app.test.tsx, todoItem.test.tsx, footer.test.tsx) or relevant variants (.test.ts), which is acceptable for non-React files.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data  
  Sample todo data is provided (for example, in todoItem.test.tsx), confirming the availability of fixtures.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented  
  The routing/filtering functionality is simulated in app.test.tsx by re-rendering the component with a modified nowShowing property. Appropriate mocks (for example, for TodoModel) ensure isolation.
