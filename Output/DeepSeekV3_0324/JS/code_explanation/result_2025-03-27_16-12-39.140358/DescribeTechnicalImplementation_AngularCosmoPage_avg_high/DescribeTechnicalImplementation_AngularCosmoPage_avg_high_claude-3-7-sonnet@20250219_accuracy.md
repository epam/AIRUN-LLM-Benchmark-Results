# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies Angular.js as the framework used
  
  The documentation consistently refers to Angular.js as the framework used for the CMS Page Management Module. This is evident in the first paragraph that states "The Page Management module is a core component of the Cosmo CMS system built with Angular.js."

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that all factories (REST, Page, Users) are accurately documented with their purposes
  
  The documentation clearly describes the Page Factory and REST Factory with their purposes. The Page Factory is described as maintaining "global state for the current page being edited" and the REST Factory as providing "API communication layer." However, while the Users service is mentioned in the "Architectural Role" section, it's not fully documented with its purpose and implementation details like the other factories, which is why I'm not 100% confident.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of the Page controller and its functionality is technically accurate
  
  The documentation provides a technically accurate description of the Page Controller (`pageCtrl`), describing it as orchestrating the "page editing workflow" with features like auto-save, URL generation, tag autocomplete, publication scheduling, and conflict resolution. Section 3.1 provides a detailed interface specification for the Page Controller with its properties and methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the RESTful API endpoints are correctly documented
  
  Section 3.2 provides a comprehensive table of REST API endpoints with their methods, parameters, and descriptions. The endpoints cover all essential CRUD operations for pages, revisions, tags, and extras.

- **Fail** (80%): Ensure that the explanation of Angular module dependencies ($resource, $location, etc.) is correct
  
  While the documentation mentions $resource in the REST Factory section as "Angular `$resource` service with CRUD operations," it doesn't comprehensively explain other Angular module dependencies like $location. There's no specific section dedicated to explaining all the Angular module dependencies used in the system. The documentation lacks information about how these dependencies are injected and used throughout the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the page management features (creating, editing, deleting) are accurately described
  
  The documentation accurately describes page management features in multiple sections. Section 1 mentions "Page creation and editing" as key functionality. Section 2.3 describes the Page Controller orchestrating the "page editing workflow." Section 3.1 lists methods like `deletePage()` and `savePage()`. Section 4.2 provides detailed use cases for creating and editing pages.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately explains how the local storage mechanism works
  
  The local storage mechanism is well-documented. It's mentioned as "Local storage integration for draft preservation" in Section 1. The Page Controller interface in Section 3.1 includes methods like `localVersion()`, `deleteNewerVersion()`, and `saveLocal()`. The data flow in Section 6.1 explicitly mentions "Auto-save to local storage" during editing. Section 4.2 also explains that when editing an existing page, changes are tracked in local storage.

- **Fail** (70%): Check that the description of form validation logic is technically accurate
  
  The documentation mentions form validation in Section 6.2 under Error Handling as "Form validation for required fields," but it doesn't provide detailed technical information about how the validation is implemented. There's no explanation of validation directives, custom validators, or how validation errors are displayed to users. Section 5.1 mentions that "Form validation errors receive focus" but does not explain the validation logic itself.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of publish/schedule date handling is correct
  
  The documentation correctly explains publish/schedule date handling in Section 4.2 under "Scheduling publication." It outlines a clear 4-step process: selecting the "Schedule" option, choosing future date/time, system validating the date, and saving with appropriate status and future date.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the tag management and autocomplete feature explanation is technically accurate
  
  Tag management and autocomplete features are well-documented. Tag management is mentioned in Section 1 as "Tag management with autocomplete." The Page Controller interface in Section 3.1 includes methods like `autocompleteTags()` and `selectSuggestion()`. Section 4.2 mentions that users can add content and tags when creating a new page. Section 6.1 mentions "URL/tag
