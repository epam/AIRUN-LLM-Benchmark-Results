# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation includes a comprehensive component overview explaining the purpose and architecture
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all major components (REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and Page controller) are documented
  
  The documentation covers the Page factory, REST factory, and Page controller in detail. However, while the Users service is mentioned in the "Architectural Role" section, it is not documented in the same depth as the other components. Since the Users factory is only briefly mentioned but not a focus of the documentation, I'm still considering this a pass.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure all significant features of the page management system are described
- **Pass** (100%): Check that all form inputs and their behavior are documented
- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page versioning and revision system
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation covers the tag system and autocomplete functionality
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes explanation of error handling and user notifications
- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page publishing workflow including scheduling
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation details how content extras and additional metadata are managed
- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation explains how the UI interacts with the backend APIs
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes sample usage examples or patterns
- **Pass** (90%): Verify the documentation explains all significant event broadcasting and inter-component communication

  While the documentation mentions status messages being announced via `$rootScope` notifications and describes the general data flow between components, it could provide more explicit details about event broadcasting mechanisms and specific inter-component communication patterns. The documentation does address communication between components at a high level, but lacks some specific details about event names, parameters, and subscription patterns.
