- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the error handling and display mechanisms are correctly documented
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that any code examples provided are syntactically correct and demonstrate proper component usage
  
- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that accessibility features are accurately documented with correct ARIA roles and attributes
  
  The documentation covers accessibility features well, including ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility. However, it doesn't specifically list the exact ARIA roles and attributes that are implemented. It mentions that "Form inputs automatically receive proper ARIA attributes through react-bootstrap" without detailing which specific attributes are applied to each element. This makes it slightly less comprehensive than it could be, although the general accessibility considerations are well documented.
