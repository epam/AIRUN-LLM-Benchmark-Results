# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component renders a container (div) that conditionally includes a dropdown section (the input and unordered list) when open.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  When the dropdown is open, an input element (with class "select-search") is rendered for searching options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The component allows selection via mouse click or keyboard by calling onChange with the selected optionâ€™s value.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The component handles both ArrowDown and ArrowUp keys to adjust the highlighted index among the filtered options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  Pressing Enter when an option is highlighted triggers the selection handler to choose that option.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  The Enter key toggles the dropdown by invoking handleToggleDropdown when the dropdown is closed, and it selects an item when open.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  The implementation does not explicitly restore focus to the main select component after the dropdown is closed. In handleOptionSelect, the input is blurred, but there is no action to move focus back to the select container, which might affect the accessibility experience.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  Clicking an option calls the handleOptionSelect function which sets isOpen to false, thereby closing the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  When an option is selected via the Enter key in keyboard navigation, handleOptionSelect is invoked and the dropdown closes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  The Escape key handler explicitly calls setIsOpen(false), thereby closing the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  An event listener on the document (added via useEffect) detects clicks outside the component and closes the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  When the component is focused and Enter is pressed (with the dropdown closed), handleToggleDropdown is called to open the dropdown.
