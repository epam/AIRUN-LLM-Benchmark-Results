# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The application correctly fetches character data from the SWAPI API (https://swapi.dev/api/people) and displays it in a list. The implementation includes a `fetchCharacters` function in the `swapi.ts` file and displays characters using the `CharacterList` component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The implementation includes a `Loader` component that is displayed while the API call is in progress. The application tracks loading state with an `isLoading` state variable and conditionally renders the loader when `isLoading` is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The application maps through all characters received in the API response and renders each one as a list item in the `CharacterList` component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  The code provided doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields. It simply displays the list of characters fetched from the API.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character is displayed with its name within a list item, as shown in the `CharacterList` component's rendering logic: `{character.name}`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The project structure, file organization, and configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json) are consistent with a Create React App project with TypeScript template. The instructions also explicitly mention using Create React App: `npx create-react-app swapi-characters --template typescript`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The application correctly manages state for loading, error, and character data using useState hooks:
  ```typescript
  const [characters, setCharacters] = useState<ApiResponse['results']>([]);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState<boolean>(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each character list item has a unique key derived from the character's URL property:
  ```typescript
  <li key={character.url} className="character-item">
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  The application properly handles different states:
  - Loading state: Shows a spinner
  - Error state: Displays an error message
  - Empty data would be handled by the map function which would not render any elements if the array is empty
