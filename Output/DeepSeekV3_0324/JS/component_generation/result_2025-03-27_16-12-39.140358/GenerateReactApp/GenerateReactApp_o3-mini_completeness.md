# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The application fetches character data via the API and uses the CharacterList component to map and render each character. This confirms that the list of characters is displayed in the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The CharacterList component checks the isLoading prop and, when true, renders the Loader component, providing a clear visual indicator during data fetching.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  By mapping over the characters array in the CharacterList component, the code ensures that every character object received from the API is rendered as a list item.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  There are no search inputs or any form elements present in the code. The implementation focuses solely on data display from the API.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each list item displays the character’s name as extracted from the fetched data, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The provided package.json and instructions to run "npx create-react-app swapi-characters --template typescript" confirm that the project was bootstrapped using Create React App with TypeScript.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The App component uses useState hooks to manage isLoading, error, and character data, with useEffect handling the API call lifecycle, which is an appropriate approach for state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  Each list item uses the character’s unique URL as a key, which satisfies the requirement for providing unique keys for list items.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  When the characters array is empty (e.g., if the API returns no data), the component renders an empty list. While no specific “empty state” message is displayed, this behavior is generally acceptable. A more user-friendly approach might include a message indicating that no characters were found, but rendering an empty list does not break the application flow.
