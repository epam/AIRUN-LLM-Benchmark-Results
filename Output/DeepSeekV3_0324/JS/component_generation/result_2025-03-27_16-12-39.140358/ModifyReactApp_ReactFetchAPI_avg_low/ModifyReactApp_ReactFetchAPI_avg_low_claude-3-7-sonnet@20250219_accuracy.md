# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type
  
  The code properly uses `useState` to manage the `searchQuery` state and updates it with `handleSearchChange` function which is called on input change events.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls
  
  The code implements debouncing with a 500ms delay (defined as `DEBOUNCE_DELAY = 500`) using `setTimeout` in the search effect. This prevents excessive API calls while typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured
  
  Axios is properly imported and used for API requests with appropriate configuration, including params for search queries and cancel tokens.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses
  
  The code includes proper TypeScript interfaces (Character, ApiResponse) and type annotations throughout, including proper typing for React components, event handlers, and state variables.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters
  
  The API endpoint is correctly constructed with search parameters using axios's params option: `axios.get<ApiResponse>('https://swapi.dev/api/people/', { params: { search: query } })`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate
  
  The code properly uses `useCallback` for the `fetchCharacters` and `handleSearchChange` functions, and `useMemo` for the filtered character list to optimize performance.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback
  
  The code includes comprehensive error handling with try/catch blocks that set error state and display error messages to users. It also handles axios cancellation errors separately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing
  
  The debounce implementation ensures that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing for 500ms, preventing unnecessary API requests.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices
  
  The code follows React best practices with appropriate use of useState for state management, useEffect for side effects, and cleanup functions to prevent memory leaks.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code
  
  The code appears clean, with no unused imports or commented-out code. There's one console.error for logging actual errors, which is appropriate for debugging.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests
  
  Loading state is properly managed with dedicated state variable and visual feedback for both initial loading and search operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns
  
  The component uses functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo), which aligns with React 18.x recommended patterns.
