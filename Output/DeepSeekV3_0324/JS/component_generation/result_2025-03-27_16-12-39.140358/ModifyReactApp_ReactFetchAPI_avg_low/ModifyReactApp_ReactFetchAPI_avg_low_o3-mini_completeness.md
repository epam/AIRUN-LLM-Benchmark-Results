# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The code includes an input element with the placeholder "Search characters..." and uses state (searchQuery) along with filtering logic (via useMemo) to filter the list of characters by name.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  The implementation manages a loading state and conditionally renders loading indicators ("Loading characters..." during the initial load and "Searching..." during searches) when API requests are in progress.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  The useEffect hook triggers fetchCharacters() on mount without a search query, ensuring that the component loads initial data.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  The code debounces input changes and then re-fetches data while also using a client-side filter (useMemo) to update the displayed list, which allows the interface to update dynamically as the user types.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  When no characters match the search criteria, the code displays a "No characters found" message to the user.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The component includes CSS class names (e.g., "character-list", "search-container") and a minimal CSS suggestion is provided that uses fluid widths. However, the CSS lacks explicit responsive breakpoints, so while it suggests an intention toward responsiveness, the implementation may depend on additional CSS for full responsiveness.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  The component maps over the filtered characters and displays them in a list, ensuring that search results are shown once the API call returns data.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  There is robust error handling in the fetchCharacters function with error state management and user feedback through an error message, which is an acceptable approach for handling errors in this component context.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The code defines TypeScript interfaces (Character, ApiResponse) and properly types the React.FC component, providing clear type definitions for API responses and component state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The implementation preserves the initial data load and now enhances it with the search and filtering features, ensuring that none of the original functionality is compromised.
