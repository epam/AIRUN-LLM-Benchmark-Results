# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props
  
  The provided code consistently uses TypeScript with proper typing throughout the codebase. All components, variables, props, and functions have appropriate type annotations. For example, the `PageEditor` component is defined as `React.FC`, interfaces are defined for all data models like `Content`, `ContentExtra`, etc., and function parameters and returns are properly typed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management
  
  The code properly implements Redux Toolkit with createSlice for state management. The `pageSlice.ts` and `userSlice.ts` files both use `createSlice` from Redux Toolkit to define reducers and actions. The store is configured using `configureStore` from Redux Toolkit in the `store.ts` file.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components
  
  All components in the code are implemented as functional components. For instance, the `PageEditor` is defined as `const PageEditor: React.FC = () => { ... }` which is the proper syntax for a React functional component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately
  
  The code demonstrates appropriate use of React hooks. In the `PageEditor` component, `useEffect` is used for data fetching when the URL parameter changes, `useState` is used in the custom `useLocalStorage` hook, and hooks like `useSelector` and `useDispatch` from Redux are also used correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource
  
  The code uses axios for API communication instead of Angular's $resource. An axios instance is created in `apiClient.ts` and used in various API methods in `contentApi.ts`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components
  
  Form handling in the `PageEditor` component uses controlled components throughout. All input elements have both `value` attributes connected to Redux state and `onChange` handlers to update that state, which is the correct pattern for controlled components in React.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation
  
  The code properly implements React Router for navigation. The `App.tsx` file sets up routes using `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, and `Route` components, and the `PageEditor` component uses router hooks like `useParams` and `useNavigate`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization
  
  The code implements internationalization using the react-i18next library, which is an appropriate choice for React applications. The `i18n.ts` file sets up the i18n instance, and the `useTranslation` hook is used in the `PageEditor` component to access translations.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization
  
  While not explicitly shown through dynamic imports, the code structure demonstrates a good foundation for code splitting by organizing the codebase into modular components and separate files for different concerns (API, state, components).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations
  
  While `React.memo` isn't explicitly shown in the provided excerpt, the code mentions using "React.memo for potential performance optimizations" in the implementation notes, indicating awareness of this optimization technique.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks
  
  The `useEffect` hooks in the code include appropriate dependency arrays. For example, in the `PageEditor` component, the `useEffect` that loads page data has `[url]` as its dependency array, ensuring it runs when the URL changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models
  
  The code includes well-defined TypeScript interfaces for all data models including `Content`, `ContentExtra`, `ContentTag`, `ContentRevision`, `PageState`, and `UserState`.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state
  
  The code correctly uses Redux selectors through the `useSelector` hook to access state in the components. For example, in the `PageEditor` component, state is
