# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented

    The code properly implements all page management functionality:
    - Create: `handleSavePage()` function for new pages
    - Update: `handleSavePage()` function for existing pages
    - Delete: `handleDeletePage()` function with confirmation
    - Duplicate: `handleSavePage(true)` function with duplication logic

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present

    Page type selection is clearly implemented with:
    - A select element for choosing page types
    - `handleTypeChange()` function that dispatches the `updatePageType` action
    - Type validation before saving

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists

    URL auto-generation from title is implemented in the `updateTitle` reducer in the `pageSlice.ts` file:
    ```typescript
    updateTitle: (state, action: PayloadAction<string>) => {
      state.title = action.payload;
      if (state.autoURL) {
        state.url = action.payload.toLowerCase().replace(/ /g, '-').replace(/[\.,\/#!$%\^&\*;:{}=_'~()\?]/g, '');
      }
    }
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented

    Tag management with autocomplete is fully implemented:
    - `handleTagsChange()` function to update tags
    - `autocompleteTags()` function that fetches tag suggestions
    - `handleSelectSuggestion()` function to select from suggestions
    - UI rendering of suggestion buttons

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available

    All three publish status options are implemented:
    - Radio buttons for "Publish", "Draft", and "Schedule"
    - `handlePublishChange()` function to update the publish status
    - Proper state handling for each option

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented

    Scheduled publishing functionality is implemented:
    - Conditional rendering of datetime input when "schedule" is selected
    - `handleScheduleDateChange()` function
    - Logic to validate and process scheduled dates in `handleSavePage()`

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present

    Local storage version handling is implemented:
    - `newerVersion` state to track if local versions exist
    - `handleLocalVersion()` to restore local versions
    - `handleDeleteNewerVersion()` to discard local versions
    - `handleSaveLocal()` to save to local storage
    - UI for showing version comparison options

- **Fail** (90%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented

    While the code has comments indicating where notifications should appear (e.g., "// Show success notification" or "// Show error notification"), there is no actual implementation of a notification system. The code is missing a notification component or service to display success/error messages to the user.

    I'm 90% confident in this assessment as the code has placeholders for notifications but doesn't show the actual implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present

    Form validation is implemented:
    - Validation checks in `handleSavePage()` for URL and page type
    - Conditional logic to prevent saving if validation fails
    - URL validation to prevent duplicates with the same URL

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled

    The code correctly implements all required API endpoints in the `contentApi.ts` file:
    - Content CRUD operations
    - Content extras management
    - Content tags management
    - Content revisions management
    - All with proper TypeScript interfaces

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented

    The code includes interface definitions and API endpoints for extras management:
    ```typescript
    interface ContentExtra {
      id?: number;
      contentID: number;
      name: string;
      extra: string;
    }
    ```
    
    And API methods:
    ```typescript
    getContentExtras: (contentID: number) => apiClient.get<ContentExtra[]>(`/
