# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props  
  All components, slices, and API modules are written in TypeScript with appropriate interfaces and type annotations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management  
  The state management is handled by Redux Toolkitâ€™s createSlice (e.g., pageSlice and userSlice).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components  
  The app exclusively uses React functional components, such as PageEditor and App.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately  
  Hooks such as useState and useEffect are used appropriately. Although useCallback or useMemo are not explicitly present, their absence does not detract from the overall proper use of hooks given the context.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource  
  Axios is used for API communication (e.g., in apiClient.ts), replacing the Angular $resource functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components  
  The input elements in the PageEditor component are controlled through state and dispatch actions, ensuring controlled component behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation  
  React Router is used in App.tsx with the BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route components for navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization  
  Internationalization is implemented using react-i18next with a defined i18n configuration.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization  
  There is no implementation of code splitting (e.g., React.lazy or Suspense) to load components dynamically for performance optimization.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations  
  There is no use of React.memo to optimize or memoize expensive component renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks  
  The useEffect hooks include appropriate dependency arrays, ensuring that effects run only when necessary.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models  
  Interfaces are defined for all data models in the API module (e.g., Content, ContentExtra, ContentTag, ContentRevision).

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state  
  useSelector is used to access the Redux store state in components such as PageEditor.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations  
  Action creators from the Redux slices (e.g., setPage, updateTitle) are appropriately implemented for state updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks  
  A custom hook (useLocalStorage) encapsulates localStorage operations, fulfilling the requirement.
