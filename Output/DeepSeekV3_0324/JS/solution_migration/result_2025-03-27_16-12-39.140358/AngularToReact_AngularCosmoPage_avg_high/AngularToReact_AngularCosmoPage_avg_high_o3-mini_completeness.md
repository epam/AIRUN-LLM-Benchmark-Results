# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
  The provided code includes handlers for creating/updating pages (handleSavePage), deleting pages (handleDeletePage), and duplicating pages, ensuring that core page management functionality is present.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
  The PageEditor component renders a select dropdown for page type with an event handler (handleTypeChange) that updates the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
  The page slice’s updateTitle reducer automatically generates a URL from the title (transforming to lowercase and replacing spaces and punctuation) when autoURL is enabled.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
  Tag handling is included via an input field for tags, asynchronous autocomplete via autocompleteTags, and suggestion selection through handleSelectSuggestion.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
  The component includes radio buttons for “publish”, “draft”, and “schedule” statuses with corresponding state management and event handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
  A datetime-local input is conditionally rendered when the “schedule” status is selected, with schedule date conversion logic implemented in handleSavePage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
  The component employs a custom hook (useLocalStorage) along with functions (handleLocalVersion and handleDeleteNewerVersion) to compare and restore local versions based on stored keys.

- **Fail** (95%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
  While there are comments indicating places to “Show success notification” or error messages, there is no actual implementation of a notification system (e.g., toast messages or alerts). This omission suggests that the notification mechanism is not fully implemented.

- **Fail** (95%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
  The code contains comments for error notifications when required fields (like URL or page type) are missing but lacks concrete validation logic and visible error feedback in the UI.

- **Fail** (95%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
  Although the API service implements many endpoints (e.g., create, update, delete for content, tags, revisions, extras), there is a call to contentApi.getContentByUrl in loadPageData that is not defined in the provided API module. This inconsistency indicates incomplete API endpoint handling.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
  The API service contains functions for extras management; however, the PageEditor component only includes placeholder comments (e.g., “// Save extras if any”) without actual functionality to create or update extras, implying that this feature is not fully implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
  The API service exposes revision endpoints and the PageEditor component calls createContentRevision when saving pages, ensuring revision history is recorded.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
  The code is modularized into folders such as api, components, hooks, store, and i18n, clearly separating different concerns and promoting maintainability.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
  Internationalization is set up using react-i18next with a comprehensive English translation resource, matching the functionality previously provided by Angular’s $translate service.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
  Routing in App.tsx is defined using React Router with routes for “/new” and “/:url”, preserving the URL structure and parameter functionality analogous to the original Angular implementation.
