# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The component is built using Angular’s Reactive Forms approach with the FormBuilder and a defined FormGroup in ngOnInit.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The synchronous validators (Validators.required, Validators.minLength, Validators.maxLength, and Validators.email) are correctly applied for each field.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  The component implements async validators (asyncNameValidator and asyncEmailValidator) that call ApiService methods to check for name/email usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The form-group component applies CSS classes (has-success and has-error) based on the control’s touched and valid/invalid state, and error messages are conditionally displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  The onSubmit method calls the API’s signup method; on success, it dispatches an action via @ngrx/store and navigates accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The form-group template includes error messages for various validation errors (required, email, minlength, maxlength, nameInUse, emailInUse).

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  There is no implementation or usage of Angular's Title service to set the page title. This requirement is not met.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The component injects Store from @ngrx/store and dispatches actions. It also injects Actions from @ngrx/effects; however, the injected Actions observable is not actively used inside the component. Despite this, the integration appears to follow NgRx best practices.  
  (Confidence is slightly less than 100% because the @ngrx/effects integration is minimal.)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button is disabled based on the conditions “submitting || signupForm.invalid”, which meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  The API call subscribes with next and error callbacks to handle successful and failed responses appropriately.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component is structured using standalone components, employs dependency injection, and has a clear separation of concerns. Minor improvements (such as using the Angular Title service for page titles) could be made, hence slightly less than full confidence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The ApiService correctly uses Angular’s HttpClient to make HTTP GET and POST requests.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The error messages in the form-group component’s template match the expected output for various validation failures.
