# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component includes all three required form fields: name, email, and password  
  The SignupComponent defines a FormGroup with fields “name”, “email”, and “password” in its ngOnInit.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page includes a heading 'Join PodBaby today.'  
  The HTML template contains a heading:  
  <h2>Join PodBaby today.</h2>

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a lead paragraph about membership benefits  
  The template includes a paragraph with the class "lead" that describes the benefits of membership.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form includes a submit button with appropriate styling and icon  
  The form includes a submit button with classes "btn btn-primary form-control" and an embedded <app-icon> component for the sign-in icon.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a link to the login page with appropriate text  
  The template provides a link with the text “Already a member? Log in here.” that routes to "/login".

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the FormGroup component or equivalent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display  
  The standalone FormGroupComponent is implemented with accompanying template logic to display validation errors and adjust styling based on control state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Icon component or equivalent is implemented for the signup button  
  The IconComponent is implemented as a standalone component that renders an icon using the provided icon input.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all validation rules are implemented (name length, email format, password length)  
  The form applies Validators for required fields, minLength, maxLength (for name), and email format as well as minLength for the password.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure asynchronous validation for both name and email uniqueness is implemented  
  The component includes async validators (asyncNameValidator and asyncEmailValidator) that call an API service to check for uniqueness.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the signup API integration is complete with proper error handling  
  The onSubmit() method calls api.signup and dispatches a signupComplete action on success. In case of an error, it resets the submitting flag.  
  Although basic error handling is present through the error callback, no user-facing error message is displayed. This slight omission is why I assign 90% confidence.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form layout matches the horizontal form structure specified  
  The form element in the template is rendered with the class “form-horizontal”, meeting the layout requirement.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page has proper document title setting functionality  
  There is no implementation for setting or updating the document title (e.g., using Angular’s Title service). This functionality is missing.
