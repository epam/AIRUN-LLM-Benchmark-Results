# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The answer is titled “Angular 14.x Migration of Todo Application” and uses Angular constructs (NgModule, components, etc.). Although the version isn’t explicitly stated in a package file, the migration context implies that Angular 14.x is intended.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The code imports and uses StoreModule.forRoot along with well-structured reducers, indicating proper usage of @ngrx/store.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  The provided code includes an Effects class (TodoEffects) and registers EffectsModule.forRoot, confirming the implementation of side effects handling via @ngrx/effects.  

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  The solution shows clearly defined actions (using createAction), a reducer via createReducer handling multiple state modifications, and selectors built with createSelector. These satisfy NgRx store best practices.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  All components (TodoAppComponent, TodoItemComponent, TodoFooterComponent) use the @Component decorator and include @Input and @Output decorators where needed.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  In TodoItemComponent, the React ref pattern is replaced by the usage of @ViewChild('editField'), which confirms the proper conversion.  

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  The components demonstrate binding via @Input and use EventEmitter with @Output for events such as toggle, destroy, edit, save, and cancel.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  The TodoService is implemented as an @Injectable service which dispatches NgRx actions for business logic and data handling.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  Dependency injection is applied in constructors (e.g., injecting Store and TodoService) in both components and services.  

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  The code does not explicitly apply any change detection strategies (such as ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush), relying on the default strategy. This could be seen as not optimizing change detection for performance in an Angular complex application.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  An AppRoutingModule is provided using RouterModule.forRoot with configurations and hash-based navigation, showing proper use of Angular Router.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code structure, use of decorators, separation into components/services, and file organization adhere to common Angular style guidelines. One minor point is the presence of a reference to “react-todos” in local storage, but overall, the style is consistent with Angular practices.  

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  Interfaces for ITodo and ITodoState are defined in the models, and type information is consistently used in functions and NgRx actions.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  All the JSX or React component structures have been replaced by Angular HTML templates and Angular-specific bindings (e.g., [(ngModel)], (click), *ngIf, *ngFor).  

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  The provided code uses Angular’s event binding syntax (e.g., (keydown), (change), (blur)) in the templates, confirming replacement of React event handlers.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  There are no leftover TODO comments in the code sample; all the code appears to be fully migrated without placeholder comments.  

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  The routing module only sets up a single route without any lazy-loaded feature module configuration. Therefore, lazy loading is not implemented in this solution.
