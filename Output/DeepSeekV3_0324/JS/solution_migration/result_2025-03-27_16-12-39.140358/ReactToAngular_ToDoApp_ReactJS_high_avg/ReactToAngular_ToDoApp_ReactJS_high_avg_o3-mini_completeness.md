# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The code retrieves the list of todos from the store and displays them using the TodoItem components within an *ngFor loop in the TodoApp template.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoAppComponent listens for keydown events (specifically the ENTER_KEY) on the new-todo input. When triggered, it calls the TodoService.addTodo action, ensuring that new todos are added.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  The TodoItem component provides a checkbox input that, when changed, calls the toggle event emitter. This is wired to the TodoService.toggle function that dispatches the toggleTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItem component includes an edit mode that triggers on a double-click. It then allows text to change and uses the save event emitter to dispatch a saveTodo action, indicating that the edit functionality is implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItem component includes a button with a destroy action. When clicked, it emits the destroy event which is handled by the TodoService.destroy method dispatching the destroyTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  The TodoAppComponent template contains an input with class "toggle-all" that, when changed, triggers the TodoService.toggleAll method to mark all todos as completed or not completed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  The application uses NgRx selectors and a route handler (based on hashchange events in the AppRoutingModule) to filter todos. The selectors (selectShownTodos) correctly apply filtering logic based on the selected filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooter component receives the active todo count via an input binding ([count]) and displays it, confirming the active count is shown.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  In the TodoFooter component template, a button is conditionally rendered based on the completedCount. This button, when clicked, emits an event that calls TodoService.clearCompleted to remove completed items.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  The TodoEffects class includes an effect (persistTodos$) that listens for modifying todo actions and then persists the current todos to local storage using the Utils.store method.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The AppRoutingModule is configured with hash-based routing using RouterModule.forRoot with { useHash: true } and listens to hashchange events to update the filter accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  The TodoAppComponent template uses an *ngIf directive to conditionally render the main section only if there are todo items. This ensures that when the todo list is empty, the UI adjusts appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  The TodoAppComponent code prevents the default event behavior in handleNewTodoKeyDown and processes the entered text properly, ensuring robust form submission handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The project is well-structured into components (TodoApp, TodoItem, and TodoFooter) with clear communication through input/output bindings and services, preserving proper relationships.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  The migration retains the same state management, action dispatching, reducer logic, and utility functions as the original React TypeScript version, ensuring that all business logic is preserved.
