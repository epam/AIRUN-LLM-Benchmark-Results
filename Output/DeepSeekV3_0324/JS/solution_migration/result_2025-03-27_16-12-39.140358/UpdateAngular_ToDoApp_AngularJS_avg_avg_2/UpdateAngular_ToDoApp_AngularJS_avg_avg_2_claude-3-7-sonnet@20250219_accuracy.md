# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions
  
- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings
  
  While the code itself does not contain explicit console errors, there could be a potential issue with the `toggleAll` method in the todo-list.component.html where the event handler uses `$event.target.checked`. In Angular, it's recommended to use a template reference variable or explicit typing with `($event as HTMLInputElement).checked` for better type safety.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design
