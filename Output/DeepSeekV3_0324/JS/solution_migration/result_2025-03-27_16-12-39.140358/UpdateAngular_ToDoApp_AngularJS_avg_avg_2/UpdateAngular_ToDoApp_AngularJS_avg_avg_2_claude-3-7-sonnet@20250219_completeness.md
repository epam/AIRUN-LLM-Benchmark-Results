# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list

    The `TodoListComponent` is clearly defined in the code. It has appropriate HTML in todo-list.component.html and TypeScript in todo-list.component.ts, which includes the necessary functionality to display todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos

    The `TodoHeaderComponent` includes the functionality to add new todos, with a form in the HTML template and a corresponding `addTodo()` method in the TypeScript file that dispatches the relevant action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos

    The `TodoItemComponent` handles editing functionality. It includes methods like `startEditing()`, `saveEdit()`, and `cancelEdit()`. The component template includes a form that appears when in editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos

    The `TodoFooterComponent` includes the filter functionality. It has UI elements for selecting different filters (All, Active, Completed) and dispatches the relevant actions to change the filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics

    The `TodoFooterComponent` also displays count statistics. It shows the remaining count with appropriate pluralization and also provides a "Clear completed" button when there are completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos

    The `TodoHeaderComponent` implements the add functionality with the `addTodo()` method which dispatches the `addTodo` action. The store is properly set up to handle this action via the reducer and effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos

    The `TodoItemComponent` implements editing with `startEditing()`, `saveEdit()`, and `cancelEdit()` methods. The component dispatches the `editTodo` action when saving edits, and the store handles updating the state accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos

    The `TodoItemComponent` includes a `deleteTodo()` method that dispatches the `deleteTodo` action. The HTML includes a delete button, and the store handles removing the todo from the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed

    The `TodoItemComponent` includes a `toggleTodo()` method that dispatches the `toggleTodo` action when the checkbox is clicked. The store then updates the todo's completed status.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)

    The `TodoFooterComponent` implements filter functionality with the `setFilter()` method which dispatches the `setFilter` action. The store selectors include `selectFilteredTodos` which returns todos filtered according to the current filter status.

    The `TodoStorageService` handles persistence with `localStorage`. The store effects include a `persistTodos$` effect that calls `saveTodos()` whenever a todo-modifying action is dispatched.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization

    The application loads persisted todos via the `loadTodos` action, which is likely dispatched in a component initialization. The `getTodos()` method in `TodoStorageService` retrieves todos from localStorage.
