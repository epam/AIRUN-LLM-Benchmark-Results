# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The answer explicitly states "Angular 14.x Migration" and the code uses Angular modules, components, and modern Angular practices that align with Angular 14.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
  The migration replaces the old RequireJS approach with ES module import/export syntax, as seen throughout the code (e.g., import statements in TypeScript files).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
  The code imports StoreModule from @ngrx/store and uses a reducer (todoReducer), confirming that NgRx store is in use for managing the application state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
  The implementation imports EffectsModule from @ngrx/effects and provides TodoEffects, which is used to handle side effects (such as data persistence) for the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
  The migration clearly defines todo.actions.ts, todo.reducer.ts, todo.selectors.ts, and todo.effects.ts that handle various todo operations confirming that the todo management is fully covered.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
  The TodoStorageService is decorated with @Injectable (with providedIn: 'root') and is properly injected into components/effects, meeting Angular’s DI requirements.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
  The TodoStorageService directly interacts with localStorage (using getItem and setItem) to persist data, verifying this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
  All provided components (e.g., AppComponent, TodoHeaderComponent, TodoListComponent, etc.) are decorated with @Component and contain the necessary metadata.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
  Both TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective use the @Directive decorator, adhering to the Angular guidelines for directives.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
  The component HTML files use Angular’s structural directives such as *ngFor and *ngIf, indicating correct template syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
  Event bindings such as (click), (submit), and (keyup.escape) are correctly used in the component templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
  The templates correctly apply property binding syntax (e.g., [class.completed]="todo.completed" and [formControl]="newTodo").

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
  The code includes lifecycle hooks such as ngOnChanges in TodoFocusDirective and ngOnDestroy in TodoEscapeDirective, and components use Angular’s mechanisms appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
  A proper interface (Todo) and an enum (FilterStatus) are defined in todo.model.ts, ensuring type safety for the data models.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
  The components and services follow Angular DI best practices by specifying dependencies in their constructors (e.g., private store: Store in components).

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code is organized and readable with clear separation of concerns. One minor point is the usage of "trackBy: trackById" in the todo-list template without an explicitly shown corresponding trackBy method. This may be defined elsewhere or omitted here for brevity. Hence, full confidence is slightly reduced.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
  There are no indications in the provided code of console errors or warnings. The migration appears clean in that respect.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
  The migration employs TypeScript features such as strong typing, interfaces, and enumerations across components, services, and store management files.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
  The provided code is clean and free of extraneous TODO comments or commented-out code segments.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design  
  The migration splits the application into focused components (header, list, item, footer, etc.) with clear responsibilities, supporting the single responsibility principle.
