  The TodoListComponent implements a toggleAll method connected to a checkbox that dispatches the toggleAll action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos  
  The selector selectRemainingCount and its usage in the footer ensure that the remaining count is displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage

  The loadTodos effect in TodoEffects retrieves todos from localStorage via TodoStorageService.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original  
  The application retains the TodoMVC HTML structure and CSS class names, preserving the original look and feel.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately  
  Both in the add and edit flows, the application checks for empty trimmed strings; in editing, an empty title leads to deleting the todo.

- **Fail** (80%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter  
  Although the AppRoutingModule defines routes for "all", "active", and "completed", the filtering controls in TodoFooterComponent use click events without routerLink bindings. As such, the URL is not automatically updated when a filter is selected.  
  • Explanation: It appears that while the routes are in place, the application does not navigate using Angular’s router (e.g., via routerLink or programmatically using router.navigate) when the filter is changed. This disconnect means the URL does not reflect the selected filter even though the state is updated. The confidence is 80% because one might argue that the routing module is designed for URL updates, yet the filtering UI does not leverage it.
