# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed
  
  The implementation includes proper handling of the Enter key in the `handleNewTodoKeyDown` function that dispatches the `addTodo` action when Enter is pressed on a non-empty input field.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter
  
  The application correctly filters todos based on the `nowShowing` state using the `shownTodos` variable that filters the todo list according to the active filter (all, active, or completed).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos
  
  The toggle-all checkbox functionality is implemented with the `toggleAll` action that marks all todos as complete or incomplete based on the checkbox state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted
  
  The TodoItem component includes functionality to toggle completion status with `toggleTodo`, edit with `saveTodo`, and delete with `destroyTodo` actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode
  
  The TodoItem component includes an `onDoubleClick` handler on the label that calls `handleEdit` which dispatches the `setEditing` action to enable editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo
  
  The TodoItem component's `handleKeyDown` function checks for the Enter key (ENTER_KEY) and calls `handleSubmit` which saves the edited todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value
  
  The TodoItem component's `handleKeyDown` function also handles the Escape key (ESCAPE_KEY), resetting the edit text to the original title and exiting edit mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The TodoFooter component receives and displays the active todo count with appropriate wording.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The TodoFooter component includes links for the three filter types (ALL_TODOS, ACTIVE_TODOS, COMPLETED_TODOS) with appropriate click handlers that dispatch the `setNowShowing` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos
  
  The TodoFooter component includes a "Clear completed" button that calls the `onClearCompleted` prop, which dispatches the `clearCompleted` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence
  
  The Redux store initializes with todos from localStorage, and each reducer function that modifies the todos array also updates localStorage with the new state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state
  
  The application uses conditional rendering to show/hide elements based on the state, such as only showing the main section and footer when todos exist and only showing the "Clear completed" button when completed todos exist.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count
  
  The TodoFooter component correctly pluralizes "item" based on the count with `const activeTodoWord = count === 1 ? 'item' : 'items';`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components
  
  The code is organized into separate focused components (TodoApp, TodoItem, TodoFooter) with clear responsibilities.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality
  
  The solution shows proper organization with components in their own files, a store directory for Redux code, and constants in a separate file.
