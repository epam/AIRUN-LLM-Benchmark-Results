# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all React imports use React 18.x compatible syntax  
  The code uses createRoot from the react-dom/client package in the entry point, which is a React 18 feature.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all components use functional component syntax with hooks instead of class components  
  All components (App, TodoItem, Footer) are written as functional components making use of hooks like useState and useEffect.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Redux Toolkit's createSlice is used for state management  
  The code uses createSlice from Redux Toolkit in the todoSlice module to define reducers and actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for all props, state, and Redux store  
  Interfaces such as ITodo, TodoState, and component prop types are clearly defined. Additionally, RootState and AppDispatch are correctly typed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses immutable state updates in reducers  
  The reducers in the slice modify state in an immutable way via Redux Toolkit’s built‑in Immer integration.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that nanoid is used for ID generation instead of custom UUID implementation  
  The addTodo reducer makes use of nanoid from the nanoid package for generating unique IDs.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the application uses React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate  
  None of the components are wrapped in React.memo. This can help prevent unnecessary re-renders, especially in components that rely solely on props.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that useCallback is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders  
  The event handlers are defined directly within the functional components (for example, handleNewTodoKeyDown in TodoApp), and useCallback is not used. This may lead to unnecessary re-creation of the functions on each render.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that localStorage handling is implemented in a modern way  
  The localStorage API is used consistently to store and retrieve todos. However, side effects (i.e. updating localStorage) directly inside reducers are generally discouraged in Redux best practices. This reduces confidence slightly even though the implementation is consistent.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows consistent naming conventions throughout the application  
  All file and variable names follow a uniform and clear naming convention.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that proper error handling is implemented where necessary  
  There is minimal error handling in cases such as JSON parsing from localStorage or potential issues in asynchronous flows. Adding try/catch blocks around localStorage operations would improve robustness.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware  
  The store is created using configureStore, which automatically applies recommended middleware including the ones for serializable checks.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that React.lazy is used for code splitting where appropriate  
  There is no use of React.lazy for dynamically loading components, which could improve performance by code-splitting the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the codebase has no TODOs remaining  
  There are no outstanding TODO comments or unfinished work indicators in the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux Provider wraps the application entry point  
  The index.tsx file correctly wraps the main TodoApp component with the Redux Provider.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure strict TypeScript type checking is implemented throughout the application  
  The codebase employs TypeScript with proper interfaces and types across components, Redux store, and utility functions.
