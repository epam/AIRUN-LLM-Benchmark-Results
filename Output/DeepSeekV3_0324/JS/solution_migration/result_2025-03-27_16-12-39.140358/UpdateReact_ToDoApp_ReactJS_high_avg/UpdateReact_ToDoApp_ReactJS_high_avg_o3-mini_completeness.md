# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The App component’s input field has an onKeyDown handler that checks for ENTER_KEY (value 13) and, if pressed with non-empty text, dispatches the addTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The code filters the todo items based on the nowShowing state (comparing against ALL_TODOS, ACTIVE_TODOS, or COMPLETED_TODOS) before mapping them into TodoItem components.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  There is an input checkbox (with id "toggle-all") that uses onChange to dispatch the toggleAll action with the checkbox’s boolean value, ensuring that all todos can be marked complete or active.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  In the TodoItem component, there are handlers to toggle the todo (using toggleTodo), to edit the todo (using setEditing and saveTodo), and to delete the todo (using destroyTodo).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  The label element in TodoItem is configured with an onDoubleClick event that calls handleEdit, which sets the component into editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  Within the TodoItem component, handleKeyDown checks for the ENTER_KEY and calls handleSubmit to dispatch the saveTodo action, thus submitting the edited todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  The same handleKeyDown function in TodoItem listens for the ESCAPE_KEY; it resets the edit text back to the original title and dispatches setEditing(null) to cancel editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooter component displays the count (from the activeTodoCount variable passed down) and conditionally pluralizes the “item” text based on the count.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The footer includes three links that dispatch setNowShowing with the appropriate filter value (ALL_TODOS, ACTIVE_TODOS, or COMPLETED_TODOS).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  In TodoFooter, when completedCount is greater than 0, a “Clear completed” button is rendered which calls the onClearCompleted function upon clicking.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  Each reducer in the todoSlice updates localStorage after changing the state (e.g., addTodo, toggleAll, toggleTodo, etc.), ensuring persistence across sessions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  The App component conditionally displays the main section (when there are todos) and the footer (when there is at least one active or completed todo).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  The TodoFooter properly checks if the count is equal to 1 to determine whether to use “item” or “items” for display.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The code is modularly split into components (TodoApp, TodoItem, and TodoFooter), each handling a specific responsibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The project structure is organized into folders (store, components, and constants) which group code by functionality, supporting maintainability.
