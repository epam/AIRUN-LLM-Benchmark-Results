# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration
  
  The code imports from 'react-dom/client' and uses `ReactDOM.createRoot()` which are specific to React 18. It also uses TypeScript throughout with proper .tsx file extensions and type definitions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure
  
  The code includes proper TypeScript interfaces in the types/index.ts file, including `PianoKeyData` and `DisplayMode` types. The soundMapper utility uses proper TypeScript typing with `Record<string, HTMLAudioElement>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks
  
  All components (Piano, PianoKey, NotesLettersToggle, FullscreenButton, Header, Footer) are implemented as functional components with the React.FC<Props> pattern and use hooks like useState, useCallback, and useEffect.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)
  
  The code uses useState for managing state like displayMode and activeNotes, and useEffect for side effects like setting up and cleaning up event listeners.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels
  
  Keyboard event handlers are properly implemented in the Piano component using useCallback and attached/detached with useEffect at the window level, with proper cleanup.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events
  
  Mouse interactions are implemented using React synthetic events in the PianoKey component with onMouseDown, onMouseUp, and onMouseLeave handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment
  
  Audio resources are handled correctly in the soundMapper.ts file using the Audio API with require for file paths, including error handling in playNote function.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility
  
  The FullscreenButton component properly implements fullscreen functionality using the standard Fullscreen API, includes error handling, and follows React patterns with a handler function.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns
  
  Conditional class application is properly implemented using template literals and ternary operators in components like PianoKey and NotesLettersToggle.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate
  
  The code uses React.memo for all components (PianoKey, Piano, Header, Footer, FullscreenButton, NotesLettersToggle) to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations
  
  Audio playback is handled with proper React lifecycle considerations, including proper state management for active notes and error handling for audio playback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application
  
  The code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout with proper interfaces, type annotations, and no "any" types. Component props are properly typed with interfaces.
