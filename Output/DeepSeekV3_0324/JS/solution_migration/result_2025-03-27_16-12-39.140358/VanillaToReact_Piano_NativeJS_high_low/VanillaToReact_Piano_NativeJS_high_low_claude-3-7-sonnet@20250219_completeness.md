# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'
  
  The Header component in `src/components/Header.tsx` correctly renders a header with the title "Virtual Piano".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons
  
  The NotesLettersToggle component in `src/components/NotesLettersToggle.tsx` implements a button container with "Notes" and "Letters" toggle buttons.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)
  
  The Piano component in `src/components/Piano.tsx` renders both white keys (7 natural keys) and sharp keys (5 black keys plus one empty space) as defined in the whiteKeys and sharpKeys arrays.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes
  
  In the PianoKey component, each key is given appropriate data attributes: `data-letter={letter}` and `data-note={note}`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked
  
  The Piano component has a playNote function that uses the soundMapper to play the appropriate audio file when keys are clicked using onMouseDown events.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)
  
  The PianoKey component includes an isActive prop that adds a 'piano-key-active' class when a key is active, providing visual feedback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes
  
  The Piano component includes keyboard event handlers (handleKeyDown and handleKeyUp) that listen for keyboard events and trigger the corresponding piano notes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked
  
  The App component maintains the displayMode state and passes it to both the NotesLettersToggle and Piano components, allowing the display to switch between notes and letters.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes
  
  The FullscreenButton component implements the fullscreen API correctly, toggling between fullscreen and normal modes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly
  
  The Piano component maintains an activeNotes array state that can track multiple active notes simultaneously.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys
  
  The provided implementation handles mouseDown and mouseUp events, but does not explicitly implement a mouse drag function that would allow playing notes by dragging across keys. While the onMouseLeave handler would stop the sound when leaving a key, there is no specific code to handle playing a new note when dragging onto a new key without releasing the mouse button.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information
  
  The Footer component in `src/components/Footer.tsx` correctly renders a footer with the year information "2020".
