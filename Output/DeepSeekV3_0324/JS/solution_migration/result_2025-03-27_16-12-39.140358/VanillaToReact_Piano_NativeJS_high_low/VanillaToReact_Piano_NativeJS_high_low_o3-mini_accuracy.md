# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration  
  The implementation uses ReactDOM.createRoot in index.tsx and suggests running Create React App with the TypeScript template ("npx create-react-app virtual-piano --template typescript"), which indicates React 18 usage.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure  
  The file src/utils/soundMapper.ts uses a Record type with HTMLAudioElement and src/types/index.ts declares interfaces and types, confirming proper TypeScript usage for structures like audio mapping.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks  
  All components (Piano, PianoKey, Header, Footer, etc.) are written as functional components using React.FC, and hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useCallback are correctly used.  

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)  
  The implementation uses useState for managing active notes and display modes, and useEffect for handling side effects like keyboard event listener registration and cleanup.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels  
  Keyboard events are managed in the Piano component with event listeners added to the window object using useEffect, which is a suitable approach for global keyboard interactions.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events  
  The PianoKey component uses onMouseDown, onMouseUp, and onMouseLeave handlers provided by React, confirming the use of synthetic events for mouse interactions.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment  
  Audio playback is managed by creating HTMLAudioElement instances and controlling playback with play() and setting currentTime to 0, which is appropriate in a React environment.  

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility  
  The FullscreenButton component checks for document.fullscreenElement and toggles fullscreen using requestFullscreen and exitFullscreen with proper error handling, which aligns with React best practices for such functionality.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns  
  Template literals and conditional class names in JSX (e.g., in PianoKey) are used correctly to apply classes based on the component's state and props.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate  
  Components such as PianoKey, Piano, Header, Footer, etc., are wrapped with React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.  

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations  
  Audio playback is triggered using hook callbacks, and side effects (like event listener registration) are properly cleaned up in useEffect, demonstrating appropriate lifecycle management.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application  
  The code uses TypeScript interfaces, type annotations, and proper typings (for components and utility files) consistently, ensuring type safety across the application.
