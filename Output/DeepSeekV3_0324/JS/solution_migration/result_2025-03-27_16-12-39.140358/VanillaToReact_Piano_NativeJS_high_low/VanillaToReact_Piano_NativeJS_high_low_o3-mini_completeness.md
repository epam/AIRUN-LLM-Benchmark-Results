# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'  
  The Header component returns a header element with an h1 containing the text "Virtual Piano".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons  
  The NotesLettersToggle component explicitly renders two buttons labeled "Notes" and "Letters" within a container.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)  
  The Piano component maps over both the whiteKeys and sharpKeys arrays to render all corresponding PianoKey components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes  
  The PianoKey component attaches data-letter and data-note attributes to its rendered div element.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked  
  The Piano component utilizes the soundMapper to retrieve and play the correct audio file when the onMouseDown event is triggered.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)  
  The active state is handled via the activeNotes array; the PianoKey component conditionally applies the "piano-key-active" class when its note is active.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes  
  The useEffect in the Piano component registers keydown and keyup event listeners that map the pressed key to the appropriate piano note.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked  
  The NotesLettersToggle component calls the provided onChange callback to update the displayMode, which is then used by the PianoKey to conditionally render either the note or the letter.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes  
  The FullscreenButton component handles toggling by checking document.fullscreenElement and calling requestFullscreen or exitFullscreen appropriately, with proper error handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly  
  The implementation using a state array (activeNotes) allows the application to track multiple active notes concurrently, avoiding duplicate plays.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys  
  The PianoKey component attaches an onMouseLeave event that calls the onMouseUp handler to ensure proper key release when dragging between keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information  
  The Footer component renders a footer with the year (2020) as expected.
