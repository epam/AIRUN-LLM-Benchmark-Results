# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18.x
  
  The code specifically imports from 'react-dom/client' and uses createRoot in the index.tsx file, which is a React 18 feature. The implementation also mentions React 18 explicitly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript for type safety
  
  The code includes TypeScript syntax throughout, with .tsx and .ts file extensions, type annotations, interfaces (like `Todo`), and type declarations for state and props.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for state management
  
  The implementation includes Redux Toolkit's createSlice in `todosSlice.ts` with proper action creators and reducers defined.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm nanoid is used for generating unique IDs
  
  The code imports and uses nanoid in the todosSlice.ts file to generate unique IDs for new todos:
  ```typescript
  import { nanoid } from 'nanoid';
  // ...
  const newTodo: Todo = {
    id: nanoid(),
    title: action.payload,
    completed: false,
  };
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code uses functional components with hooks instead of class components
  
  All components are implemented as functional components with React hooks:
  - useState for local component state
  - useSelector for Redux state access
  - useDispatch for dispatching actions
  - useRef for DOM references
  - useEffect for side effects

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains the same routing functionality with proper route handling
  
  The application implements React Router with proper route handling for filtering todos:
  ```typescript
  <Router>
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/:filter?" element={<TodoApp />} />
    </Routes>
  </Router>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Redux store is properly configured with appropriate slices
  
  The store.ts file properly configures the Redux store with the todos slice and includes support for middleware and preloaded state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the Redux provider is set up in the application entry point
  
  The Redux Provider is correctly set up in App.tsx:
  ```typescript
  <Provider store={store}>
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/:filter?" element={<TodoApp />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  </Provider>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for all data structures
  
  The code defines appropriate interfaces and types, such as:
  ```typescript
  export interface Todo {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    completed: boolean;
  }
  
  export type FilterType = 'all' | 'active' | 'completed';
  ```
  
  It also includes type declarations for props and Redux state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows React best practices for component composition
  
  The code follows best practices by:
  - Breaking down the UI into reusable components (Header, TodoList, TodoItem, Footer)
  - Using CSS modules for component-scoped styling
  - Keeping components focused on specific responsibilities
  - Properly passing props between components

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles keyboard events properly
  
  The code correctly handles keyboard events:
  ```typescript
  // In Header.tsx for creating todos
  const handleKeyUp = (e: KeyboardEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    if (e.key === 'Enter' && inputValue.trim()) {
      dispatch(addTodo(inputValue.trim()));
      setInputValue('');
      inputRef.current?.focus();
    }
  };
  
  // In TodoItem.tsx for editing todos
  const handleEditKeyUp = (e: KeyboardEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    if (e.key === 'Enter') {
      saveEdit();
    } else if (e.key === 'Escape') {
      cancelEdit();
    }
  };
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application maintains local storage persistence if implemented
  
  The implementation includes local storage persistence through
