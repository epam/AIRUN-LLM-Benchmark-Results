# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos  
  The Header component renders an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element with the title "todos" and an input field to enter new todo text.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos  
  The TodoList component renders a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> with a nested ToggleAll component containing a checkbox, and it maps over the filtered todos to render a list.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button  
  Each TodoItem component includes an input checkbox for toggling, a label for displaying the title, and a button for deleting the todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode  
  The TodoItem component listens for a double-click event on the label, which triggers the editing mode by updating the componentâ€™s state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The Footer component displays filter links ("All", "Active", "Completed") and the Redux slice along with selectors properly implements filtering logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization  
  The Footer shows the active todos count with dynamic pluralization using a conditional check (item vs. items).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter  
  In the Footer, each filter link conditionally applies a special style (e.g., <code>styles.selected</code>) when it matches the currently selected filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist  
  The Footer conditionally renders a "Clear completed" button whenever there is at least one completed todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter  
  The Header component listens for the Enter key in the input field and dispatches the addTodo action when pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos  
  Each TodoItem renders a checkbox which, when changed, dispatches the toggleTodo action to update its completion status.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once  
  The ToggleAll subcomponent in TodoList implements a master checkbox that dispatches the toggleAll action to update all todos simultaneously.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management  
  The TodoItem component enables editing mode on double-click and uses a ref to focus the input field when entering edit mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos  
  A delete button is provided in the TodoItem component to dispatch the deleteTodo action for removing a specific todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos  
  The Footer includes a button that dispatches the clearCompleted action, removing all todos marked as completed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status  
  The selectors in <code>todosSelectors.ts</code> correctly filter todos based on the current filter state ("all", "active", or "completed").
