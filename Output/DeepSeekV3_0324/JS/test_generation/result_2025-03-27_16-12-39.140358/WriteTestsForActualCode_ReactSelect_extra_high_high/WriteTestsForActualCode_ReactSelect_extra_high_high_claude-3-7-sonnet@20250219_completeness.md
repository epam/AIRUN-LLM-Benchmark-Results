# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present
- **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented
- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested
- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states
- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance

    The test suite does not include specific performance tests for large option sets. While the answer mentions "Performance tests for large option sets" as an additional test that could be added, there are no actual test cases in the provided code that verify the component's performance with large datasets.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering
- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations

    The provided test suite does not include tests for custom formatOptionLabel implementations. The test cases focus on standard label rendering but don't specifically test scenarios where formatOptionLabel is provided to customize how options are displayed.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)

    The test suite includes solid testing for the onChange callback across various scenarios, but lacks specific tests for onInputChange, onMenuOpen, and onMenuClose callbacks. While the onChange functionality is well covered, these other callbacks aren't explicitly tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)
