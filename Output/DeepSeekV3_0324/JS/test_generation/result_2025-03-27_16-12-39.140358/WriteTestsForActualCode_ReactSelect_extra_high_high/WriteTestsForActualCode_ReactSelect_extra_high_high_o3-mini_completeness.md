# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist.  
   → The test suite contains tests such as "renders with default props" that verify the component mounts correctly with default settings.

2. **Fail** (95%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present.  
   → While the tests cover arrow keys, enter, and escape, there is no explicit verification for the "tab" key. This omission leads to a failure on this step.

3. **Fail** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering).  
   → The tests verify mouse clicks (e.g., on options and clear buttons); however, there is no test covering hovering behavior.

4. **Pass** (90%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior.  
   → The suite includes a controlled value test and tests default behavior. Although an explicit uncontrolled scenario isn’t detailed separately, the default rendering tests suffice for uncontrolled behavior. The slight uncertainty is due to the lack of dedicated uncontrolled tests.

5. **Fail** (90%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values.  
   → Although selecting and clearing are verified, there is no explicit test for state changes when "removing" a selected option (other than the clear action). This results in an incomplete coverage of state change tests regarding removals.

6. **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented.  
   → Multiple tests confirm that the menu opens on click or key interaction and closes when the escape key is pressed.

7. **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality.  
   → The test "filters options based on input" confirms that the component filters options as expected.

8. **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist.  
   → A dedicated test for multi-select behavior verifies that multiple options can be selected and the onChange callback receives the correct values.

9. **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility.  
   → ARIA attributes (such as aria-label, aria-expanded, etc.) and a live region for screen reader announcements are properly tested.

10. **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested.  
    → There is an explicit test ensuring the component renders correctly when provided with an empty options array.

11. **Fail** (95%): Validate tests for loading and error states.  
    → While there is testing for the loading state (displaying the loading message), there is no coverage for potential error states.

12. **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states.  
    → The test "handles disabled state" confirms that the component behaves appropriately when disabled.

13. **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance.  
    → No tests address performance with large datasets; therefore, this aspect is not covered.

14. **Pass** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested.  
    → The test verifying focus management (e.g., the input retaining focus after opening the menu) adequately covers this requirement.

15. **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering.  
    → Tests exist to check that placeholder text is rendered when no value is selected and that the selected value is displayed in the controlled value test.

16. **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations.  
    → There is no test addressing custom formatting of option labels (formatOptionLabel).

17. **Fail** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose).  
    → Although onChange is tested several times, there are no tests for onInputChange, onMenuOpen, or onMenuClose callbacks.

18. **Fail** (95%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading).  
    → The test suite verifies clear and loading indicators; however, there is no dedicated test for the dropdown indicator. This partial coverage results in a failure.
