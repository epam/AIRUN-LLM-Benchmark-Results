# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)
  
  The tests clearly use Jasmine as the testing framework with Karma as the test runner, as shown in the karma.conf.js configuration and the use of Jasmine's describe/it syntax throughout the test files.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints
  
  The tests properly mock REST API endpoints using the $httpBackend service in AngularJS. For example, in rest.factory.spec.js, there are expectations set up for GET and PUT requests with $httpBackend.expectGET and $httpBackend.expectPUT.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation
  
  All test files consistently use beforeEach hooks to set up the testing environment, including module loading, dependency injection, and mock creation. The REST factory test also includes afterEach hooks to verify no outstanding HTTP requests or expectations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls
  
  HTTP requests are properly mocked using $httpBackend in the REST factory tests and using jasmine.createSpy with fake promises in the controller tests. For example, mockContentSave, mockContentUpdate, and mockContentDelete are spy functions that return fake promises.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection
  
  All tests properly use Angular's dependency injection system with the inject function. For example: `beforeEach(inject(function(_$rootScope_, _$controller_, _$location_, _$routeParams_, _$q_, _REST_, _Page_, _Users_, _$translate_) {...})`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations
  
  The tests handle promises appropriately by using $q.defer() to create deferred objects, and calling $rootScope.$digest() to resolve promises in the tests. For example, in the controller tests, promises are created for mock REST calls and then resolved with $rootScope.$digest().

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies
  
  External dependencies are properly mocked using Jasmine spies. For example, REST.content.save, update, and delete methods are mocked with jasmine.createSpy() that return fake promises. Additionally, localStorage, $location, and $rootScope.$broadcast are spied on to verify interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization
  
  All tests follow the describe/it pattern for organization. There are main describe blocks for each component, with nested describe blocks for specific features or scenarios, and individual it blocks for specific test cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls
  
  The tests cover both success scenarios (e.g., successful page save, update, delete) and error scenarios (e.g., empty URL, missing page type). For example, in the controller tests, there are specific tests for validation errors where $rootScope.$broadcast is expected to be called with error messages.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate
  
  The tests simulate user interactions by directly calling controller methods that would be triggered by user actions. For example, $scope.titleChange(), $scope.deletePage(), and $scope.savePage() are called to simulate user interactions with the page form.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage
  
  The tests clean up after execution with afterEach hooks in the REST factory tests to verify no outstanding expectations or requests. Additionally, the use of isolated scopes ($rootScope.$new()) for each test ensures state isolation between tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested
  
  The test names are clear and descriptive, explaining exactly what is being tested. For example, "should initialize page properties", "should restore values from localStorage", "should update Page.title", etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible
  
  The tests focus on validating function outputs and side effects rather than implementation details. For example, they verify that after calling $scope.savePage(), the appropriate REST methods are called,
