# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources  
  The provided tests for the REST factory only include actual test cases for the "blocks" resource. The other resources (e.g., blocksRequirements, comments, content, etc.) are only mentioned in a comment without concrete test implementations.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly  
  The tests for the Page factory confirm that all default properties are initialized as expected and that property updates work properly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly  
  The tests for the Users factory verify that all the required properties have their correct default values and allow proper updates.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods  
  The test suite covers many methods in the controller (e.g., initialization, localVersion, deletePage, titleChange, savePage) but omits tests for several public methods such as descriptionChange, urlChange, saveLocal, autocompleteTags, selectSuggestion, updatePageType, and deleteNewerVersion.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller  
  The tests confirm that the page properties are initialized correctly and that the scheduleDate is set for new pages.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation  
  The tests check that when autoURL is enabled, the URL is auto-generated based on the title and that it remains unchanged when autoURL is disabled.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction  
  There is no explicit test named “saveLocal” or equivalent test that verifies proper localStorage saving behavior beyond what is indirectly checked in the localVersion tests.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality  
  The test suite does not include any tests for functions handling autocomplete tag suggestions.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)  
  While the tests for savePage cover the new page and update scenarios, and also check error cases for empty URL and unselected type, there is no specific test covering a "duplicate" page case.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types  
  The tests simulate scenarios where the URL is empty and where the page type is missing; error notification is properly verified in these cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly  
  The deletePage tests confirm that the REST.content.delete method is called, that the success notification is broadcast, and that redirection occurs as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions  
  The tests for localVersion verify that values are restored from localStorage, that localStorage items are cleared, and that the newerVersion flag is set to false.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components  
  Although the test suite claims over 80% code coverage in its analysis, there is no concrete evidence or coverage report provided to back up this claim, making the verification incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling  
  Multiple tests (such as those in deletePage and savePage) confirm that events are correctly broadcast to notify the user of actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality  
  The tests check that a scheduleDate is set for new pages, addressing the date handling requirement.
