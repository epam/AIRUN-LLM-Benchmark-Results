# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering
- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos
- **Fail** (90%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos

    The app.tsx test file does not explicitly include a test for clearing completed todos. While the mockModel has a clearCompleted function that is mocked, there is no test case that directly tests this functionality by calling the clearCompleted method and verifying the expected behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events
- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts
- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation
- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos
- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions

    The todoModel.test.ts file doesn't include specific tests for the subscribe and inform functions. While the model.inform function is mocked in the setup, there are no actual test cases that verify these functions work correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx
- **Fail** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented

    The test suite lacks explicit tests for routing functionality with appropriate mocks. While there is a comment mentioning "Normally we would mock the router, but for simplicity we're just testing the filtering logic", this confirms that proper router mocking is not implemented. A complete test suite should include proper mocking of the router to test navigation and URL-based filtering.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data

    The answer does not include dedicated test fixtures for sample todo data. While there are mock todos created within individual test files, there's no separation of test data into fixtures that could be reused across test files, which is a best practice for maintaining consistent test data.
