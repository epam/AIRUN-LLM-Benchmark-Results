# Evaluation Report

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering  
  The app.test.tsx file contains a test ("should render todos") that renders the TodoApp component and checks for the presence of todo text.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos  
  The test "should add new todo on enter key" confirms that adding a new todo is handled correctly.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos  
  The presence of the test "should toggle all todos" demonstrates that the functionality to toggle all todos is covered.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos  
  The test "should filter active todos" is present and verifies the filtering logic.

- **Fail (100%)**: Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  No test in app.test.tsx explicitly verifies that clearing completed todos functionality works, though similar functionality is tested in other files.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering  
  The test "should render todo item" confirms that the component renders as expected.

- **Fail (100%)**: Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos  
  While there are tests for toggling (via checkbox) and editing (entering edit mode, saving and canceling via keyboard), there is no explicit test that triggers the destruction (deletion) of a todo item.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events  
  The tests "should save on enter key" and "should cancel on escape key" ensure that keyboard events are handled correctly.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts  
  The test "should render active items count" confirms that the footer correctly displays the number of active todos.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation  
  The test "should highlight current filter" confirms that the current filter is visually indicated.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The tests checking for the rendering of the "Clear completed" button and its click action confirm this functionality.

- **Fail (100%)**: Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos  
  Although tests for adding todos and toggling are present, there are no tests specifically verifying the 'save' and 'destroy' functionalities.

- **Fail (100%)**: Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions  
  The test file for TodoModel does not include tests for validating the subscribe and inform mechanisms.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The test "should clear completed todos" confirms this capability.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation  
  The test for UUID generation is present and correctly verifies the format.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality  
  Both singular and plural use cases are tested in the pluralize tests.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations  
  The tests cover storing, retrieving, and handling the case when no data is available.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function  
  The merging of objects using the extend function is verified via an explicit test.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx  
  The test files for UI components use the .test.tsx convention and non-UI logic tests use .test.ts, which is acceptable. This is in line with common project conventions.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data  
  Sample data (mock todos) are provided in multiple test files to simulate the required scenarios.

- **Fail (100%)**: Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented  
  The TodoApp test file only simulates filtering by rerendering and does not implement dedicated router mocks for testing routing functionality.
