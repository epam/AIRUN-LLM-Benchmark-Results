# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Ensure that the API call to https://swapi.dev/api/people is made using axios.
**Pass**: The code uses `axios.get('https://swapi.dev/api/people')` to make the API call.

### Step 2: Make sure the data is fetched initially without any input fields.
**Pass**: The data is fetched within the `useEffect` hook, which runs on component mount, without any input fields.

### Step 3: Ensure a loader or loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass**: The code displays `<p>Loading...</p>` when `loading` state is `true`.

### Step 4: Verify that errors are logged to the console if the API call fails.
**Pass**: The code logs errors to the console with `console.error('Error fetching characters:', error)` in the `catch` block.

### Step 5: Ensure that the fetched characters are displayed in a list format.
**Pass**: The code maps over `characters` and displays each character's name in a `<li>` element within a `<ul>`.

### Step 6: Make sure each list item has a unique key derived from the characterâ€™s URL.
**Fail**: The code uses the array index as the key (`key={index}`), which is not unique and not derived from the character's URL.
