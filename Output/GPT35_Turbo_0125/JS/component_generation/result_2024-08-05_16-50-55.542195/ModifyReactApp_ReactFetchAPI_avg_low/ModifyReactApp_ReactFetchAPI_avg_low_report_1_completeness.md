# Evaluation Report

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Check that a loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.**
   - **Pass**: The code includes a loading indicator (`if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;`).

2. **Verify that the loader does not hide the search input when data is loading.**
   - **Fail**: The loading indicator replaces the entire content, including the search input. The search input should remain visible while loading.

3. **Validate that a request with an empty search term is sent on the initial render.**
   - **Pass**: The initial URL is set to `https://swapi.dev/api/people` when `searchTerm` is empty.

4. **Verify that the search input field is present.**
   - **Pass**: The search input field is present in the JSX (`<input type="text" placeholder="Search characters..." value={searchTerm} onChange={handleSearch} />`).

5. **Ensure that the character search functionality is implemented.**
   - **Pass**: The search functionality is implemented by updating the `searchTerm` state and triggering a new fetch request.

6. **Ensure that the API request includes the search term as a query parameter.**
   - **Pass**: The URL is updated to include the search term (`url = \`https://swapi.dev/api/people/?search=${searchTerm}\`;`).

7. **Validate that the data is loading on initial app load with empty query and then when the search term changes.**
   - **Pass**: The `useEffect` hook triggers data loading on initial render and when `searchTerm` changes.

8. **Ensure that the debounced fetch function prevents unnecessary API requests.**
   - **Fail**: The code does not implement debouncing, which could lead to unnecessary API requests on rapid input changes.

9. **Confirm that the character list is updated based on the search results.**
   - **Pass**: The character list is updated based on the search results (`setCharacters(response.data.results);`).

10. **Validate that the application handles API request errors.**
    - **Pass**: The application handles API request errors with a try-catch block and logs the error (`console.error('Failed to fetch characters:', error);`).

11. **Ensure that the user experience remains smooth without backend overloads.**
    - **Fail**: Without debouncing, rapid input changes could overload the backend with requests.

### Summary

- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 11
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 8
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 3

### Conclusion

The code meets most of the evaluation criteria but fails in maintaining the search input visibility during loading, implementing debouncing to prevent unnecessary API requests, and ensuring a smooth user experience without backend overloads. These issues should be addressed to improve the overall functionality and performance of the application.
