# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps:

1. **Pass**: Confirm that constraints related to local storage limitations are noted.
    - The answer mentions that "Storing todos in local storage can be a performance bottleneck for large datasets."

2. **Pass**: Verify that assumptions about the application being designed for a single user are mentioned.
    - The answer states, "The application uses local storage to persist todo data, assuming a single user environment where data needs to be stored locally."

3. **Fail**: Ensure that browser compatibility assumptions are included.
    - The answer does not mention any assumptions about browser compatibility.

4. **Pass**: Check that performance-related constraints are noted.
    - The answer discusses performance constraints, such as local storage limitations and the need for performance optimizations.

5. **Pass**: Confirm that performance optimizations, such as the use of `shouldComponentUpdate`, are identified.
    - The answer mentions, "The code includes optimizations like `shouldComponentUpdate` to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components."

6. **Pass**: Verify that considerations for using immutable data structures for performance are mentioned.
    - The answer states, "The code emphasizes the use of immutable data structures for better performance and predictability in React applications."

7. **Pass**: Ensure scalability considerations related to local storage limitations are discussed.
    - The answer discusses scalability concerns related to local storage, stating, "Consideration should be given to scalability if dealing with a significant number of todos."

8. **Fail**: Check that the potential need for a backend service for better scalability is mentioned.
    - The answer does not mention the potential need for a backend service for better scalability.

9. **Pass**: Confirm that the evaluation steps are unambiguous and concise.
    - The evaluation steps are clear and concise.

10. **Pass**: Ensure that each step allows the evaluator to assess the output based solely on the provided code.
    - Each step is designed to assess the output based on the provided code.

11. **Pass**: Verify that the steps are clearly articulated and cover all main points of the task.
    - The steps are clearly articulated and cover the main points of the task.
