# Evaluation Report

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.**
   - **Pass**: All imports in the provided code are used.

2. **Ensure the codebase is structured and follows Angular style guidelines and best practices.**
   - **Pass**: The code is well-structured and follows Angular style guidelines.

3. **Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of Angular and TypeScript.**
   - **Pass**: The code uses modern Angular and TypeScript features, suggesting compatibility with the latest versions.

4. **Verify the application works correctly across modern browsers.**
   - **Not Evaluated**: This step requires runtime testing which is not possible in this static evaluation.

5. **Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.**
   - **Not Evaluated**: This step requires runtime testing which is not possible in this static evaluation.

6. **The code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility.**
   - **Pass**: The code is decomposed into multiple components, each with a single responsibility.

7. **Code should not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.**
   - **Pass**: The code does not contain any noticeable duplicates and follows DRY principles.

8. **Ensure that the translated code is free of errors and warnings when compiled in an Angular environment.**
   - **Not Evaluated**: This step requires compilation which is not possible in this static evaluation.

9. **App does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of Angular’s framework.**
   - **Pass**: The code does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of Angular’s framework.

10. **App does not overuse Angular references for DOM access instead of Angular’s state and props.**
    - **Pass**: The code uses Angular’s state and props appropriately without overusing direct DOM access.

11. **App correctly uses Angular lifecycle hooks, avoiding infinite loops.**
    - **Pass**: The provided code does not show any misuse of Angular lifecycle hooks.

12. **Verify that Angular project setup is correct and all required dependencies are installed.**
    - **Not Evaluated**: This step requires access to the project setup which is not possible in this static evaluation.

13. **Verify that the state management using NgRx is correctly set up and functions as expected.**
    - **Pass**: The `TodoModel` class uses NgRx store, suggesting state management is set up.

14. **Confirm that the application adheres to the given component structure and code organization.**
    - **Pass**: The application adheres to a clear component structure and code organization.

15. **Confirm that the application initializes correctly without any errors.**
    - **Not Evaluated**: This step requires runtime testing which is not possible in this static evaluation.
