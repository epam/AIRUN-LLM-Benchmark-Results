# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps:

1. **Check that the tests are isolated and do not depend on each other.**
   - **Pass**: The tests are isolated within their respective `describe` blocks and do not depend on each other.

2. **Validate that the tests adhere to best practices for unit testing.**
   - **Pass**: The tests follow best practices by using `beforeEach` to set up the environment and by checking for specific elements and actions.

3. **Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.**
   - **Pass**: The code does not contain any noticeable duplicates and follows the DRY principles.

4. **Verify that the testing environment is set up correctly.**
   - **Pass**: The testing environment is set up correctly with `redux-mock-store` and `@testing-library/react`.

5. **Check if a testing library for JavaScript (such as Jest) has been chosen.**
   - **Pass**: The code uses `@testing-library/react`, which is a popular testing library for React applications.

6. **Validate that dependencies are mocked where necessary, such as API calls.**
   - **Fail**: The code does not show any mocking of dependencies such as API calls. This might be necessary for a complete test suite.

7. **Verify that the test coverage for the code is at least 80%.**
   - **Fail**: The provided code does not include any information about test coverage. This needs to be verified separately.

8. **Confirm that the package.json file includes necessary dependencies and scripts for running tests.**
   - **Fail**: The provided code does not include the `package.json` file, so this cannot be confirmed.

9. **Confirm that the tests use the proper methods and assertions from the chosen testing library.**
   - **Pass**: The tests use proper methods and assertions from `@testing-library/react`, such as `render`, `fireEvent`, and `getByText`.

### Summary:

- **Total number of steps evaluated**: 9
- **Number of passed steps**: 6
- **Number of failed steps**: 3

### Conclusion:

The tests are generally well-written and follow best practices, but there are some areas that need improvement, such as mocking dependencies, verifying test coverage, and including the `package.json` file.
