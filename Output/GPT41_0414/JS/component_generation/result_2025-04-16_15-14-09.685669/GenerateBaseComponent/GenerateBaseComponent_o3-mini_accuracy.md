# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  Although the code does not explicitly mention the React version, the structure and API usage (React.FC, hooks, etc.) are consistent with React 18.x. We assume the environment is set up accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  The code uses TypeScript syntax (e.g., the .tsx extension, interfaces, type annotations) and defines clear types for props and options.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  An `index.css` file is provided containing all necessary styles for the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  The code is well-structured, free of extraneous comments or TODO markers, and the comments present help explain key functionalities.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  The component employs `useState` hooks to manage dropdown state, search input value, and highlighted option index, which is in line with best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  Props such as `options`, `value`, `onChange`, `placeholder`, `className`, `disabled`, and `ariaLabel` highlight the componentâ€™s reusability and customizability.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  The component implements keyboard navigation (Arrow keys, Enter, Escape) for both the input and button elements, ensuring accessible interaction.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  The use of `useRef` for DOM element references, along with proper event listener cleanup in `useEffect`, demonstrates adherence to best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  Focus is correctly managed. When the dropdown opens, the input is focused, and when it closes, focus returns to the button, ensuring a good user experience.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  The component uses ARIA attributes such as `aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, `aria-label`, and appropriate roles on list items and listbox to support accessibility.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  Based on the static examination, the code appears to be error-free. However, without executing the code in an actual environment, there is a slight uncertainty regarding runtime warnings in edge cases.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  The component manages state and effects efficiently. Although there are no explicit optimizations (like memoization), there is no clear indication of unnecessary re-renders. Nonetheless, this assessment is based on static analysis without profiling in a live environment.
