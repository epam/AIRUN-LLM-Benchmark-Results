# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component renders a button that, when activated, conditionally displays a dropdown container with a list element. The structure clearly implements a dropdown select UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  When the dropdown is open (isOpen is true), an input element is rendered at the top of the dropdown for searching options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The component allows the selection of a single option by clicking an item or pressing Enter when an option is highlighted. The onChange callback receives the selected option’s value, supporting single selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The input’s keydown handler listens for the ArrowDown and ArrowUp keys, which update the highlightedIndex state to navigate through the options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  The input keydown handler checks for the Enter key, and if an item is highlighted, it calls the selectOption function to select that item.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  The button’s onKeyDown handler listens for Enter (and Space) and toggles the dropdown – calling openDropdown to show or closeDropdown to hide it.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  The closeDropdown function explicitly calls buttonRef.current?.focus(), ensuring focus is returned to the select component after the dropdown is closed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  Each option’s onClick event calls selectOption, which in turn calls closeDropdown, closing the dropdown upon mouse selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  When an option is selected using the Enter key in the input’s onKeyDown handler, the same selectOption function is called, resulting in the dropdown closing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  The input’s onKeyDown handler listens for the Escape key and calls closeDropdown, closing the dropdown as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  An effect is set up to attach event listeners for mousedown and touchstart to detect clicks outside the component’s container, which then triggers closeDropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  The button’s onKeyDown handler checks for the Enter key and calls openDropdown if the dropdown is not already open, thereby opening it on Enter key press.
