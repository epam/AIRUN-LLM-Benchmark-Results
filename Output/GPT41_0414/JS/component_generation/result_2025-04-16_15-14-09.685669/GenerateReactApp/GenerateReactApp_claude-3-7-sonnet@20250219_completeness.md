# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The application uses axios to fetch Star Wars characters from the SWAPI API (`https://swapi.dev/api/people`), processes the response data, and displays them in a list. This is evident in the `fetchAllCharacters` function and the rendering logic in the App component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The application uses a loading state (`loading`) that is set to true before API calls and false after completion. While loading, it displays a "Loading..." message:
  ```jsx
  {loading && (
    <div style={{ padding: '1rem', textAlign: 'center' }}>
      <span>Loading...</span>
    </div>
  )}
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The application fetches all characters by paginating through the API results. The `fetchAllCharacters` function continues making requests as long as there's a `next` URL, ensuring all characters are collected before displaying them:
  ```javascript
  while (url) {
    const response = await axios.get<SwapiPeopleResponse>(url);
    allCharacters.push(...response.data.results);
    url = response.data.next;
  }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  There are no search input fields or search functionality implemented in the provided code. The application simply fetches and displays all characters without any filtering capabilities.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character is rendered as a list item showing the character's name:
  ```jsx
  {characters.map((character) => (
    <li key={character.url} style={{ ... }}>
      {character.name}
    </li>
  ))}
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The provided code includes files typical of a Create React App project: `package.json`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/index.tsx`, and `src/react-app-env.d.ts`. The `package.json` includes React Scripts and the scripts section matches CRA's default configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The application uses three state variables for managing its different states:
  - `characters`: Stores the list of fetched characters
  - `loading`: Tracks whether data is being fetched
  - `error`: Stores any error message that occurs during fetching
  
  These states are properly used to conditionally render different UI components based on the application state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each list item uses the character's URL as the key, which should be unique across all Star Wars characters in the API:
  ```jsx
  <li key={character.url} style={{ ... }}>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  The application checks for loading and error states before rendering the character list. It only renders the list when there's neither loading nor error:
  ```jsx
  {!loading && !error && (
    <ul style={{ listStyle: 'none', padding: 0 }}>
      {characters.map((character) => (
        <li ... >
          {character.name}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )}
  ```
  If the characters array is empty, this would render an empty unordered list, which is an appropriate way to handle empty data.
