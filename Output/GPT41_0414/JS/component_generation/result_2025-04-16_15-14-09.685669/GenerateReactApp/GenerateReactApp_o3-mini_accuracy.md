# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses React 18.x or newer by checking the package.json dependencies  
  The package.json clearly specifies "react": "^18.2.0" and "react-dom": "^18.2.0", which confirms the use of React 18.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that TypeScript is properly implemented with appropriate type definitions for all components, props, and states  
  The codebase includes a dedicated types.ts file with proper definitions (e.g., Character and SwapiPeopleResponse) and uses TypeScript in React components (e.g., App component typed as React.FC).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Axios is used for API requests to fetch data from the Star Wars API endpoint  
  The code uses Axios in the fetchAllCharacters function with axios.get<SwapiPeopleResponse>, which confirms proper usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles API errors gracefully with appropriate error states or messages  
  The implementation uses try-catch in the loadCharacters function to set an error state ("Failed to fetch characters.") and displays it appropriately, ensuring graceful error handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the character data is fetched on component mount using useEffect hook  
  The useEffect hook calls the loadCharacters function on component mount, which confirms the intended functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application properly manages component rendering optimization  
  The usage of useCallback for the loadCharacters function and minimal re-render logic demonstrates component optimization.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows React best practices using hooks appropriately  
  The code effectively uses useState, useEffect, and useCallback in a manner consistent with React best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't contain any TODO comments or unnecessary code  
  A review of the code shows no TODO comments or extraneous code. The code is focused on the described functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the codebase has minimal comments that only clarify complex logic when necessary  
  The comments present are minimal and serve to clarify the implementation without cluttering the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the API endpoint 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' is being called correctly  
  The API endpoint is defined correctly in the constant SWAPI_PEOPLE_URL and used in the fetchAllCharacters function.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application renders without console errors or warnings  
  The React code follows standard practices and, when run in a Create React App TypeScript project, should render without generating console errors or warnings.
