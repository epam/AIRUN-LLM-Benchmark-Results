# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The code fetches all characters through the SWAPI and displays them in a list via mapping over the "characters" state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  A conditional rendering based on the "loading" state exists that shows a "Loading..." text while the API call is in progress.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  The implementation collects characters from paginated responses and, once loading is complete and no errors occur, all characters are rendered in the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  The code does not implement any search functionality or interactive input elements; it purely fetches and displays data.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each rendered list item shows the character's name, which confirms that the display is correct.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The presence of "react-scripts" in package.json and the overall project file structure indicates a CRA TypeScript setup.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The use of React useState hooks for "loading", "error", and "characters" provides good state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  The list items use the unique "character.url" as keys, ensuring optimal rendering and reconciliation by React.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  The application conditionally renders the list only when "loading" is false and no error occurs.  
  However, there is no explicit user feedback (like a "No characters found" message) when the fetched results are empty.  
  Although rendering an empty list is acceptable and does not cause errors, an explicit empty state message could further improve the user experience.
