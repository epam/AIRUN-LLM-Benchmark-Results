# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The component includes an input field with id "character-search" that, via its onChange handler, updates the search state, effectively filtering characters by name.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  When the component is fetching data (loading state is true), it displays a div with "Loading...", ensuring users are informed of background activity.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  The component's useEffect hook calls fetchCharacters with an empty query on mount, which fetches initial data as intended.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  The debounced search mechanism (with a 500ms delay) ensures that as users type, the search state updates and triggers a new API call to update results dynamically.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  When no characters are returned, the component renders a "No results found." message, providing clear feedback to the user.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The component uses CSS grid styles with auto-fit and minmax values, ensuring a responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  Once the API call returns data, the character list is rendered as a grid of list items displaying the character names, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  An ErrorBoundary component is implemented to catch and handle errors gracefully, along with local error handling in the fetchCharacters function.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The code defines TypeScript interfaces for API response data (Character, SwapiResponse) and component props (ErrorBoundaryProps, etc.), ensuring strict typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The code integrates the search functionality without sacrificing the initial data load, API integration, error handling, and responsive design, thereby maintaining the overall functionality.
