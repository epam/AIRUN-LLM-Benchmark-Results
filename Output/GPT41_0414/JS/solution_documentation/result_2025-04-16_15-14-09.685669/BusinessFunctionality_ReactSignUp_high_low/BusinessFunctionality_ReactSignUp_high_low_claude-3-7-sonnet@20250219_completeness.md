- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the success and error handling during form submission
    
    The documentation describes success and error handling in multiple places. Section 1 states: "**On success:** The user is registered, and the Redux store is updated. **On failure:** Error messages are displayed."

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains the Redux integration for form state management
    
    The documentation clearly explains Redux integration. In section 2, it states "**Signup** uses **reduxForm** HOC to connect to Redux and manage form state." Section 5 further elaborates on Redux use for state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the visual feedback mechanisms for form validation

    The documentation mentions navigation capability, stating "**Link:** Navigates to the login page" in section 3, and "User can navigate to login if already registered" in multiple sections. However, it doesn't explicitly mention "React Router" by name, which is why I'm 90% confident.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains how the form handles submission states (submitting, disabled)
    
    The documentation addresses submission states in section 3 under "User Interface Elements": "**Button:** Submits the form, shows loading state when submitting."
