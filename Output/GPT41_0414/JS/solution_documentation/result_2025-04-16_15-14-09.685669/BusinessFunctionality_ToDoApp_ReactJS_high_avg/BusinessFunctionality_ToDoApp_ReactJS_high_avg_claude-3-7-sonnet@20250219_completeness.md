# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers all main functionality including adding, editing, deleting, and toggling todos
  
  The document clearly describes all main functionalities in multiple sections. In section 1.1, it lists "add new todo items, edit existing todo items, mark items as completed or active, delete individual todo items" as key features. Section 2.1 further elaborates on these functions with specific UI interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about filtering todos by status (all, active, completed)
  
  Filtering is explicitly mentioned in section 1.1 as "Filter view: All, Active, Completed" and further detailed in section 2.1 under "Filter Todos" where it states "Footer links: All, Active, Completed."

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the user workflow for creating new todo items
  
  Section 2.1 under "Add Todo" clearly states "Input field at the top. Pressing Enter adds a new todo." Section 2.2 also begins with "User enters a task and presses Enter to add."

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the editing functionality triggered by double-clicking
  
  The document mentions this functionality in section 2.1 under "Edit Todo" with "Double-click on a todo label to edit. Enter saves, Escape cancels, blur also saves."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the clear completed functionality
  
  Clear completed functionality is covered in section 1.1 as "Clear all completed items" and detailed in section 2.1 under "Clear Completed" as "Button in footer removes all completed todos."

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the toggle all functionality
  
  Toggle all functionality is mentioned in section 1.1 as "Bulk toggle all items as completed/active" and in section 2.1 under "Bulk Toggle" as "Checkbox at the top toggles all todos as completed/active."

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the counter for remaining items
  
  The counter for remaining items is mentioned in section 1.2 where it states "TodoFooter (`footer.tsx`): Displays count of active items, filter links, and 'Clear completed' button."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the persistent storage of todos
  
  Persistent storage is covered in multiple sections. In section 1.1, it mentions "Persistent storage (localStorage)" as a key feature. Section 1.3 details "All todos are stored in localStorage under a namespace (`react-todos`). On app load, todos are loaded from localStorage."

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the UI components and their relationships
  
  Section 1.2 "Core Components and Relationships" thoroughly describes all UI components (TodoApp, TodoItem, TodoFooter) and their relationships, including a component hierarchy diagram.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the business objectives addressed by the application
  
  Section 3 "Business Objectives" comprehensively covers primary business goals (Task Management, User Productivity, Data Persistence) and secondary objectives.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes performance and scalability considerations
  
  Section 5 "Performance and Scalability Considerations" details performance optimizations, scalability approaches, and potential concerns like localStorage size limits.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes technical constraints and limitations
  
  Section 4 "Constraints and Assumptions" clearly outlines technical limitations like "LocalStorage Only", "Single User", and "No Authentication" along with architectural assumptions and dependencies.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the document covers the pluralization of item/items text based on count
  
  The document indirectly references pluralization in section 1.2 where it mentions "Utils (`utils.ts`): Utility functions for UUID generation, pluralization, localStorage, and object extension." However, it doesn't explicitly mention that the item/items text in the counter is pluralized based on count, which is why I'm 90% confident rather than 100%.
