# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props

    The code consistently uses TypeScript with proper typing throughout. Examples include interfaces for Page, User, and props for various components. Function parameters and return types are properly typed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management

    Redux Toolkit with createSlice is properly implemented in pageSlice.ts and usersSlice.ts with appropriate actions and reducers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components

    All components are implemented as functional components using the React.FC type annotation, such as in PageEditor, Button, Input, and others.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately

    The code makes appropriate use of React hooks throughout. useState for form state, useEffect for side effects like auto-URL generation, useCallback for memoized callbacks, and React.memo for component memoization.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource

    API communication is implemented using axios in the pageApi.ts file, replacing AngularJS's $resource.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components

    Form handling in PageEditor.tsx uses controlled components with state management via useState and onChange handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation

    React Router v6 is properly implemented with BrowserRouter, Routes, Route components in routes.tsx, and navigation via useNavigate hook.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization

    The code uses react-i18next for internationalization, as shown in the i18n setup and usage with the useTranslation hook.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization

    Code splitting is implemented using React.lazy and Suspense for route-based code splitting in routes.tsx.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations

    React.memo is consistently applied to UI components like Button, Input, Select, and TagInput, as well as the PageEditor component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks

    Dependency arrays are properly used in useEffect and useCallback hooks throughout the code, ensuring they only run when necessary.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models

    TypeScript interfaces are clearly defined for all data models including Page, PageState, User, and component props.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state

    Redux selectors are used in components to access state, such as in PageEditor where useSelector is used to access page and user state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations

    Action creators are properly implemented and exported from the Redux slices (setPage, setConfirmDelete, setUser, etc.).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks

    Local storage functionality is implemented via the custom useLocalPageStorage hook with appropriate methods for getting, setting, and clearing data.
