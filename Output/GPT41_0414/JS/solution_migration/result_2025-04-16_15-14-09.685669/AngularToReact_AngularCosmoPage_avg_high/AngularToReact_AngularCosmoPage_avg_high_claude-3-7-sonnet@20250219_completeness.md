# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented

  The code includes functions for saving, updating, deleting, and duplicating pages. These are implemented in the `handleSave` and `handleDelete` functions in the `PageEditor` component, with appropriate API calls via `pageApi`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present

  The code includes a `Select` component for page type selection with proper handling in the form.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists

  URL auto-generation is implemented through a useEffect hook that watches for changes to the title, converts it to a URL-friendly format, and updates the form when `autoURL` is enabled.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented

  Tag management is implemented with the `TagInput` component and the `handleTagInput` function that fetches tag suggestions from the API and updates the Redux state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available

  The code includes radio buttons for the three publish status options: publish ('Y'), draft ('N'), and schedule.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented

  Scheduled publishing functionality is implemented with a conditional datetime input that appears when the 'schedule' option is selected.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present

  Local storage features are implemented through the `useLocalPageStorage` hook and the UI for comparing/restoring/discarding local versions is present in the `PageEditor` component.

- **Fail** (90%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented

  While the code includes alert messages for success/error scenarios, it uses browser's native `alert()` function rather than a more sophisticated notification system that would match modern React best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present

  Form validation is implemented in the `handleSave` function, checking for required fields like title, URL, and page type.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled

  The code includes a comprehensive API service abstraction in `pageApi.ts` that covers all the necessary endpoints for page management.

- **Fail** (80%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented

  While `extras` is included in the Page interface, there's no specific UI or handlers for managing these extras in the provided code. This appears to be missing from the implementation.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained

  The code does not include any implementation for revision history functionality. There are no components, API calls, or state management related to revision history in the provided code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components

  The code follows a feature-based folder structure with clear separation of concerns between UI components, Redux state management, API services, and types.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved

  Translation functionality is implemented using react-i18next with the appropriate setup and usage throughout the components.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters

  While the code includes routing setup with React Router and handles URL parameters, it's not entirely clear if it maintains exactly the same URL structure as the original application. The provided routes are limited to `/:url` and `/new`.
