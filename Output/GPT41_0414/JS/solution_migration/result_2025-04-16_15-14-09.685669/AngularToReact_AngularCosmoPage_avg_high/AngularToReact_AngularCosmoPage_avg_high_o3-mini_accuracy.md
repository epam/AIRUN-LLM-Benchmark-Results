# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props  
  All UI components, Redux slices, hooks, and API services use TypeScript, with declared interfaces and prop types provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management  
  The code uses createSlice from Redux Toolkit in both page and users slices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components  
  All components (e.g., PageEditor, Button, Input) are implemented as functional components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately  
  The code demonstrates proper usage of hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useCallback. Although useMemo isnâ€™t explicitly needed, the other hooks are appropriately applied.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource  
  Axios is used consistently for handling API calls in the pageApi module.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components  
  The form in PageEditor uses controlled components, updating state on every change.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation  
  React Router v6 is used, including useNavigate and route definitions in the AppRoutes configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization  
  The implementation employs react-i18next for translation and internationalization support.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization  
  Code splitting is achieved using React.lazy and Suspense in the definition of AppRoutes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations  
  Several components (e.g., Button, Select, Input, TagInput, PageEditor) are wrapped in React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks  
  Most hooks include the necessary dependencies. However, one useEffect (for auto-generating the URL) has an ESLint disable comment that might indicate a slight oversight. While the functionality remains correct, explicit dependencies could further improve clarity.  
  Explanation: The disabled ESLint rule suggests a manual decision in the dependency array, which could be refined to fully satisfy strict dependency tracking.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models  
  Interfaces for Page, PageState, and User are clearly defined, ensuring that data models are strictly typed.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state  
  The implementation utilizes useSelector with RootState to access Redux state accurately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations  
  The Redux slices include appropriately implemented action creators (e.g., setPage, setConfirmDelete) via createSlice.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks  
  A custom hook (useLocalPageStorage) is implemented to handle local storage operations, ensuring proper encapsulation and usage.
