# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
  The answer implements creation, updating, deletion, and duplication via the handleSave and handleDelete functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
  The PageEditor renders a Select component for the page type, ensuring the user can choose a type.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
  A useEffect hook automatically updates the URL from the title when autoURL is enabled, demonstrating this functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
  The code uses a TagInput component with autocomplete suggestions and updates tag suggestions via an API call.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
  Radio inputs provide the three publish status options as required.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
  When the publish status is set to "schedule", a datetime-local Input is rendered for selecting the scheduled date.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
  The useLocalPageStorage hook, along with corresponding restore and discard handlers, manages local version comparisons and restorations.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
  Although basic, the code uses alert calls to notify the user of error conditions and successful actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
  The handleSave function verifies that necessary fields such as page type, title, and URL are present before proceeding.

- **Fail** (80%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
  While several core endpoints related to content and tags are implemented, the code only includes a subset of endpoints and indicates with a comment that “other endpoints as needed” may be added. This partial handling makes it less than a full implementation.  
  *Explanation: Since not all endpoints from the original AngularJS code (especially those beyond core content and tag operations) are specified, the evaluation cannot be fully confident of complete handling.*

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
  The Page interface includes fields like “extras” and “misc,” but there is no corresponding logic in the provided code to manage these fields.  
  *Explanation: No functions or API calls demonstrate manipulation or handling of extras/misc data.*

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
  The provided migration code does not include any implementation related to revision history.  
  *Explanation: Revision history management, which may have been part of the original requirements, is absent in this migration sample.*

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
  The project structure clearly separates features (with their slices, APIs, and hooks) from UI components and the app entry points.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
  The i18n setup using react-i18next is correctly implemented, and translation functions are utilized throughout the components.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
  Routing is handled using React Router with paths that mirror the original URL structure (i.e., "/new" and "/:url").
