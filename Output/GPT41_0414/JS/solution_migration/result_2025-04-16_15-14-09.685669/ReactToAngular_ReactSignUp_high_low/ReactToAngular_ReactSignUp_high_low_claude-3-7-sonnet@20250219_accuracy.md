# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling
  
  The SignupComponent clearly uses Angular's Reactive Forms approach. This is evidenced by the import of FormBuilder, FormGroup, and Validators from '@angular/forms', and the creation of a FormGroup in the ngOnInit method using FormBuilder.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)
  
  The form validation correctly implements the required synchronous validations:
  - Name field has Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3), and Validators.maxLength(60)
  - Email field has Validators.required and Validators.email
  - Password field has Validators.required and Validators.minLength(6)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use
  
  The component implements two async validators:
  - nameAsyncValidator: Checks if a name is already in use by calling the API service's isName method
  - emailAsyncValidator: Checks if an email is already in use by calling the API service's isEmail method
  
  Both validators properly implement debounce using timer(300) and return appropriate validation errors when the API indicates the name or email is already taken.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched
  
  In the form-group.component.html, there are appropriate CSS classes applied conditionally:
  - 'has-error' class is applied when control is touched and invalid
  - 'has-success' class is applied when control is touched and valid
  
  These classes provide visual feedback to the user about validation status.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions
  
  The onSubmit method in the SignupComponent correctly:
  1. Checks if the form is invalid before proceeding
  2. Extracts name, email, and password from the form values
  3. Dispatches the signup action with the appropriate payload
  
  The AuthEffects then handles the signup action by calling the API service's signup method and dispatching either signupComplete or signupFailure based on the response.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails
  
  The form-group.component.html template includes appropriate error messages for each validation scenario:
  - Required field errors
  - Min/max length errors for name
  - Email format errors
  - Custom errors for name or email already being taken
  - Minimum length error for password
  
  These errors are displayed conditionally when the control is touched and has specific errors.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service
  
  The code sets a title property using the getTitle utility function, but it does not use Angular's Title service to set the document title. The proper approach would be to inject Title from '@angular/platform-browser' and call setTitle method. Instead, the code only sets a component property which might be displayed in the template but doesn't affect the browser tab title.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management
  
  The code correctly implements NgRx for state management:
  - Store is injected in the constructor
  - Actions are defined in auth.actions.ts
  - Effects are implemented in auth.effects.ts to handle API calls
  - Reducers are defined in auth.reducer.ts to update state
  - Selectors are used to access parts of the state (e.g., selectAuthSubmitting)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress
  
  The submit button in signup.component.html has a [disabled] attribute that disables the button when:
  - The form is invalid OR
  - The submission is in progress (tracked via submitting$ observable)
  
  This prevents multiple submissions and provides user feedback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses
  
  In auth.effects.ts, the signup effect properly:
  - Calls the API service's signup method
  - Maps successful responses to signupComplete action
  - Catches errors and maps them to signupFailure action
  
  This ensures both success and error cases are handled appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management
  
  The SignupComponent follows Angular best practices:
  - Implements OnInit interface and uses ngOnInit lifecycle hook
  - Uses ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush for better performance
  - Separates template and component logic
  - Properly injects dependencies
  - Uses getter methods for form controls
  - Has a clear component structure

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises
  
  The ApiService correctly uses Angular's HttpClient for API calls:
  - HttpClient is injected in the constructor
  - Methods return Observables instead of Promises
  - Proper typing is used for responses

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements
  
  The form-group.component.html displays appropriate error messages for all validation scenarios:
  - Required field: "This field is required"
  - Name length: "Name must be between 3 and 60 characters in length"
  - Email format: "A valid email address is required"
  - Name taken: Uses the error message from the validator
  - Email taken: Uses the error message from the validator
  - Password length: "Password must be at least 6 characters"
