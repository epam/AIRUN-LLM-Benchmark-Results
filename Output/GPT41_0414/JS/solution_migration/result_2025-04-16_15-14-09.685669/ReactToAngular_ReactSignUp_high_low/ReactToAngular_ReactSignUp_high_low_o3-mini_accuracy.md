# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The component creates a reactive form using FormBuilder (fb.group) and manages form controls with FormGroup.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The component sets up Validators.required, Validators.minLength, Validators.maxLength for the name; Validators.required and Validators.email for the email; and Validators.required, Validators.minLength for the password.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  The code provides async validators for both name and email that call the ApiService methods (isName and isEmail) after a short delay, properly mapping the response to validation errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The form-group component template applies conditional CSS classes (has-error and has-success) based on the controlâ€™s touched and validity state and displays error messages accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  In the onSubmit() method, after validating the form state, the component extracts form values and dispatches the signup action, which is subsequently handled by an effect that calls the API.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The form-group component template includes a <span> element with ng-container directives to render appropriate error messages for various validation errors.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  The component sets the title using a utility function (getTitle) but does not inject or use Angular's Title service, as the evaluation step requires.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The code clearly demonstrates the usage of @ngrx/store (dispatching actions and selecting state) and @ngrx/effects (handling side effects for the signup process).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The button in the template is disabled based on the condition: the form is invalid or the asynchronous observable (submitting$) is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  The AuthEffects signup$ effect handles API responses by mapping a successful response to a signupComplete action and catching errors to dispatch a signupFailure action.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component uses lifecycle hooks, dependency injection, and reactive forms effectively. While overall structure and patterns are appropriate, "Angular best practices" can be subjective; minor improvements (such as using Angular's Title service for setting the page title) could be considered.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The ApiService utilizes HttpClient for making HTTP GET and POST requests, which is the recommended approach in Angular.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The error messages cover required fields, minimum/maximum length for the name, valid email format, specific async errors (nameTaken and emailTaken), and a password minimum length message, matching the expected validation feedback.
