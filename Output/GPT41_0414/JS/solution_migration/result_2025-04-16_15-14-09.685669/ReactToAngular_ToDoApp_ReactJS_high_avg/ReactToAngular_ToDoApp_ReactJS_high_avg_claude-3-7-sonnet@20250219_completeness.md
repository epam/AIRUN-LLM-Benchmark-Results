# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items
  
  The code includes a todo list component (`todo-app.component.html`) that displays todo items using `*ngFor` directive and subscribes to the filtered todo items from the store using `todos$ | async`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented
  
  The `handleNewTodoKeyDown` method in `todo-app.component.ts` dispatches the `addTodo` action when the Enter key is pressed on the new todo input field.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works
  
  The `onToggle` method in `todo-item.component.ts` dispatches the `toggleTodo` action to toggle the completed state of a todo item. The UI reflects this with the `completed` class.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented
  
  Editing functionality is implemented through the `onEdit`, `onSave`, and `onCancel` methods in `todo-item.component.ts`. Double-clicking a todo item enters edit mode, and the changes can be saved or canceled.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented
  
  The `onDestroy` method in `todo-item.component.ts` dispatches the `destroyTodo` action to remove a todo item.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented
  
  The `toggleAll` method in `todo-app.component.ts` dispatches the `toggleAll` action to mark all todo items as complete or incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works
  
  Filtering is implemented through the Angular Router and NgRx. The `app-routing.module.ts` defines routes for the different filters, and the `setFilter` method in `todo-footer.component.ts` navigates to the appropriate route.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The footer component (`todo-footer.component.html`) displays the count of active items with the text "X items left".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items
  
  The `clearCompleted` method in `todo-app.component.ts` dispatches the `clearCompleted` action to remove all completed todo items.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage
  
  The `TodoService` provides methods to load from and save to localStorage, and the `TodoEffects` handles the persistence of todos through effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation
  
  The `app-routing.module.ts` defines routes that match the expected URL structure: '/', '/active', and '/completed'.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states
  
  The `todo-app.component.html` includes conditional rendering based on the count of todos, and the todo list is wrapped in an `ng-container` with an empty template as fallback.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly
  
  Form submissions for adding and editing todo items are handled properly with key events (Enter to submit, Escape to cancel), preventing default browser behavior when necessary.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships
  
  The component structure follows Angular best practices with clear parent-child relationships, input/output bindings, and store integration.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved
  
  The business logic is preserved and adapted to Angular's patterns using NgRx for state management. The reducer, actions, and effects maintain the same functionality as the original application.
