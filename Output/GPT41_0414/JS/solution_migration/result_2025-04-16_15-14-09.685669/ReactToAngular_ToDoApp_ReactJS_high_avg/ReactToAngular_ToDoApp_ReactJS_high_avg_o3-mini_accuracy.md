# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The answer explicitly states that the migration is for Angular 14.x and the code structure (NgModule, components, etc.) is consistent with Angular conventions.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The code imports and uses StoreModule from '@ngrx/store' and implements a reducer for managing todos.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  The provided answer includes an effects file (todo.effects.ts) that uses createEffect from '@ngrx/effects' to handle side effects.  

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  The answer contains a well-structured implementation with actions, reducers, and selectors, responsibly managing the Todo state.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  Every component in the answer is correctly decorated with @Component, and the use of @Input and @Output is appropriately applied for property binding and event emission.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  React refs in the original implementation have been correctly replaced by Angular’s @ViewChild (e.g., for 'newField' and 'editField').  

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  The components (like TodoFooterComponent) correctly use @Input for receiving data and @Output with EventEmitter for emitting events.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  The migration includes a TodoService for persisting data (load and save methods) to localStorage, which confirms proper use of Angular services.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  The code demonstrates dependency injection through constructors (e.g., injecting Store, TodoService, ActivatedRoute, and Router) which follows Angular’s DI practices.  

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  Although the code is well-structured, it does not explicitly utilize Angular’s change detection strategies (such as ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush). This is noted as a further enhancement in the summary rather than an implemented feature.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  The migration includes an AppRoutingModule which configures routes using Angular Router.  

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code is largely in conformance with Angular style guidelines; however, minor improvements (e.g., explicit change detection strategies) could further enhance its alignment.  
  (Confidence slightly reduced since style adherence is partly subjective and minor deviations might exist.)  

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  TypeScript interfaces such as Todo and TodoFilter, along with other type definitions, are clearly maintained across the application.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  The migration completely replaces JSX with Angular HTML templates and proper Angular template syntax.  

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  Event handlers originally present in React are properly translated to Angular's (event) bindings in the templates.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  A review of the provided code shows no residual TODO comments.  

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  The answer does not include any implementation of lazy loading for feature modules. It is mentioned as a further enhancement, but it hasn’t been implemented in the current migration plan.
