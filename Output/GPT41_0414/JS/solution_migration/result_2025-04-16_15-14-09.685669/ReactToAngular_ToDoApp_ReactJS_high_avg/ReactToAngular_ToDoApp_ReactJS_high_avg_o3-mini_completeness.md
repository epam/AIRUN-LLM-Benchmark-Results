# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The Angular component for the todo list uses an *ngFor loop (in todo-app.component.html) to iterate over and display each todo item.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoAppComponent handles new todo input via the handleNewTodoKeyDown method and dispatches the addTodo action when the ENTER key is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  The TodoItemComponent implements the onToggle method which dispatches the toggleTodo action to change a todo's completion state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent provides onEdit, onSave, and onCancel methods, along with an input field for editing, which facilitate modifying existing todo items.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent includes an onDestroy method that dispatches the destroyTodo action for deleting items.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  In the TodoAppComponent, the toggleAll function dispatches the toggleAll action, allowing all todos to be marked as complete or incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  The application sets the filter based on the URL in ngOnInit, and the selectors apply the correct filter to display todos based on their status.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooterComponent displays the count of active items using the activeCount input and applies pluralization appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The TodoFooterComponent includes a button that, when clicked, emits an event to trigger the clearCompleted action that filters out completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  The TodoService handles persistence by saving and loading todo items via localStorage, ensuring data persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The routing module sets up paths for '/', '/active', and '/completed', preserving the original URL structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  The todo-app.component.html includes conditional rendering (using *ngIf) to handle empty states when no todos exist.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  The new todo form is handled with a keydown event listener that prevents default submission and dispatches the appropriate action when conditions are met.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The design clearly separates responsibilities among components (todo-app, todo-item, todo-footer), using Inputs and Outputs along with a shared store via NgRx.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  The migration plan includes equivalent state management with NgRx (actions, reducers, selectors, effects) and maintains all original functionalities as seen in the React TodoMVC app.
