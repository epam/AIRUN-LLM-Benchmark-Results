# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The code explicitly mentions Angular 14.x in various places, including the title "Angular 14 TodoMVC" in the index.html and the migration plan specifies "full migration plan and code for your AngularJS+RequireJS TodoMVC app to **Angular 14.x**".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS
  
  The code consistently uses ES module imports throughout all files (import statements), which is the standard module system in Angular, replacing RequireJS that was used in the original app.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management
  
  The implementation includes @ngrx/store with proper imports, store configuration in the app module, and usage of Store in components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects
  
  The code includes @ngrx/effects with a proper TodoEffects class that handles side effects like loading todos and persisting todos to local storage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management
  
  The implementation includes a comprehensive set of actions (todo.actions.ts), reducers (todo.reducer.ts), selectors (todo.selectors.ts), and effects (todo.effects.ts) for todo management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator
  
  The TodoStorageService uses the @Injectable decorator with providedIn: 'root' to make it properly injectable.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service
  
  The TodoStorageService implements localStorage for data persistence through its get() and put() methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators
  
  All components (TodoAppComponent, TodoHeaderComponent, TodoListComponent, TodoItemComponent, TodoFooterComponent) use proper @Component decorators with selector, templateUrl, and where applicable, styleUrls.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators
  
  Both directives (TodoFocusDirective, TodoEscapeDirective) use proper @Directive decorators with selectors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)
  
  The templates use Angular syntax including *ngFor, *ngIf, and async pipe for handling observables.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))
  
  Event binding is implemented correctly with (click), (change), (blur), (ngSubmit), etc. throughout the templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])
  
  Property binding is implemented correctly with [class.completed], [checked], [todoFocus], etc. throughout the templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed
  
  The code includes proper lifecycle hooks like ngOnInit in the TodoAppComponent and ngOnChanges in the TodoFocusDirective.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models
  
  TypeScript interfaces are used for data models, including Todo interface and TodoState interface.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services
  
  Dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services using constructor injection for Store and TodoStorageService.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code generally follows Angular style guide conventions with proper naming, structuring files by feature, and using appropriate decorators. The 95% confidence is because I can't verify every single style guide rule in detail, but the code appears to follow best practices.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings
  
  The code appears well-structured and should not produce console errors or warnings, but since we can't actually run the code, this assessment is based on code inspection only.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)
  
  The code correctly uses TypeScript features including interfaces for models and state, type annotations for variables, parameters, and return types.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code
  
  The code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code. The migration notes specifically mention "No TODOs or deprecated APIs."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design
  
  The components are well-structured with each having a single responsibility: TodoAppComponent as the main container, TodoHeaderComponent for adding todos, TodoListComponent for displaying the list, TodoItemComponent for individual items, and TodoFooterComponent for filtering and counts.
