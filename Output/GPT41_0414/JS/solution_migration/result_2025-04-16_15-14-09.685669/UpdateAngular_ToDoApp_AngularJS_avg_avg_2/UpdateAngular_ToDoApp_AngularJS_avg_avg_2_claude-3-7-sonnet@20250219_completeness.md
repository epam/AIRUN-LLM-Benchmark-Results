# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list
  
  The code includes a `TodoListComponent` in `components/todo-list/todo-list.component.ts` with corresponding HTML template that displays the list of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos
  
  The code includes a `TodoHeaderComponent` in `components/todo-header/todo-header.component.ts` that contains the input field and functionality for adding new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos
  
  Editing functionality is implemented in the `TodoItemComponent` in `components/todo-item/todo-item.component.ts` which includes methods like `startEdit`, `doneEdit`, and `revertEdit`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos
  
  The `TodoFooterComponent` in `components/todo-footer/todo-footer.component.ts` implements the filtering functionality with the `setFilter` method.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics
  
  The `TodoFooterComponent` shows count statistics through the `remainingCount$` and `todosCount$` observables.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos
  
  The `addTodo` method in `TodoHeaderComponent` dispatches the `addTodo` action to create new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos
  
  The `TodoItemComponent` implements editing functionality with the `startEdit` and `doneEdit` methods, along with appropriate action dispatching.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos
  
  The `remove` method in `TodoItemComponent` dispatches the `removeTodo` action to delete todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed
  
  The `toggleCompleted` method in `TodoItemComponent` dispatches the `updateTodo` action with the changed completion status.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The filtering functionality is implemented in both the `TodoFooterComponent` UI and through the `selectFilteredTodos` selector that filters based on the current filter state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete
  
  The `markAll` method in `TodoListComponent` dispatches the `markAll` action to toggle all todos' completion status.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos
  
  The `clearCompleted` method in `TodoFooterComponent` dispatches the `clearCompleted` action to remove all completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos
  
  The `TodoFooterComponent` template displays the remaining count through the `remainingCount$` observable.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage
  
  The `TodoStorageService` in `core/services/todo-storage.service.ts` implements `get` and `put` methods that interact with localStorage, and the `persistTodos$` effect in `TodoEffects` ensures todos are saved.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization
  
  The `TodoAppComponent` dispatches the `loadTodos` action on initialization, which triggers the `loadTodos$` effect that retrieves todos from storage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing
  
  The `TodoEscapeDirective` in `core/directives/todo-escape.directive.ts` listens for the Escape key and emits an event, which is used in the todo item to cancel editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo
  
  The `TodoFocusDirective` in `core/directives/todo-focus.directive.ts` automatically focuses the input field when it receives a truthy value, which is triggered when editing begins.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original
  
  The HTML structure follows TodoMVC conventions and the application includes references to the standard TodoMVC CSS in the `index.html`, though without seeing the rendered result, I cannot be 100% certain.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately
  
  Both the `addTodo` method in `TodoHeaderComponent` and the `doneEdit` method in `TodoItemComponent` perform trim operations and handle empty titles appropriately, either not adding the todo or removing it.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter
  
  The footer component includes anchor elements with href attributes, but I don't see explicit URL routing configuration. It appears the app might be using fragment-based navigation, but I'm not completely certain if this properly updates the URL.
