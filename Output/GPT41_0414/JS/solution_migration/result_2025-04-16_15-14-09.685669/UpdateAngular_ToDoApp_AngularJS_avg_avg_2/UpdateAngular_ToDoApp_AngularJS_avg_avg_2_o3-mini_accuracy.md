# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The project files use Angular modules and structures that are in line with Angular 14.x best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
  The code uses ES module syntax (with import/export statements) throughout, replacing the older RequireJS pattern.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
  The application imports and configures NgRx via StoreModule.forRoot and uses a reducer to manage the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
  The EffectsModule is clearly set up along with the necessary effect files, showing proper usage of NgRx effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
  Specific files exist for actions, reducers, selectors, and effects, all dedicated to managing todo items.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
  The TodoStorageService is correctly annotated with @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
  The TodoStorageService implements methods that use localStorage for getting and putting todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
  Every component (e.g., TodoAppComponent, TodoHeaderComponent) uses the @Component decorator with proper metadata.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
  Both custom directives (todoFocus and todoEscape) are implemented correctly using the @Directive decorator.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
  Templates consistently make use of Angular structural directives like *ngFor and *ngIf.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
  The componentsâ€™ templates use (click) bindings and other event bindings appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
  The code uses proper property binding syntax such as [class.completed] to conditionally apply classes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
  Lifecycle hooks (like ngOnInit in components and ngOnChanges in directives) are correctly used.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
  The Todo model and TodoState are defined with TypeScript interfaces, clearly providing typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
  Components and services receive dependencies via their constructors, following Angular DI conventions.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code structure, file naming, and overall patterns adhere closely to Angular best practices. Although the style is consistent, additional enhancements (such as explicit OnPush change detection in components) could further align with advanced style guide recommendations.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
  Based on the static code review, there are no evident issues that would lead to console errors or warnings. However, runtime verification might be needed to guarantee this completely.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
  The application benefits from strong typing and uses TypeScript features (interfaces and type annotations) effectively.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
  There are no indications of leftover TODO comments or commented-out code fragments in the provided files.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design  
  Each component and service is focused on a single task, maintaining separation of concerns throughout the application.
