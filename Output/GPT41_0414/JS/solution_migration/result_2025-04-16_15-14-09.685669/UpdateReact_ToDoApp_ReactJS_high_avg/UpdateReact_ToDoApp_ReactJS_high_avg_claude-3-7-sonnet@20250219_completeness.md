# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed
  
  The code in `TodoInput.tsx` clearly shows event handling for the Enter key press that captures the input value, trims it, checks if it's not empty, and then calls the `onAdd` function with the value.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter
  
  The `TodoMain.tsx` component implements filtering logic using a `useMemo` hook that filters todos based on the current filter value ('all', 'active', or 'completed'). The filtered todos are then passed to the `TodoList` component for rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos
  
  The `toggleAll` action is implemented in the Redux slice and used in the `TodoMain.tsx` component with an input checkbox that dispatches this action when changed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted
  
  The `TodoItem` component provides complete functionality for toggling (via checkbox), editing (via double-click), and deleting (via the destroy button) individual todo items.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode
  
  In `TodoItem.tsx`, the label element has an `onDoubleClick` handler that calls the `handleEdit` function, which dispatches the `setEditing` action to enter editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo
  
  The `TodoItem` component includes a `handleKeyDown` function that checks for the Enter key press and calls `handleSubmit`, which saves the edited todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value
  
  The `handleKeyDown` function in `TodoItem.tsx` handles the Escape key press by resetting the edit text to the original todo title and calling the `onCancel` function.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The `TodoFooter` component displays the count of active items with proper pluralization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The `TodoFooter` component includes filter links for 'All', 'Active', and 'Completed' with the appropriate class for the selected filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos
  
  The `TodoFooter` component includes a 'Clear completed' button that appears only when there are completed todos. It dispatches the `clearCompleted` action when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence
  
  The `todosSlice.ts` file implements local storage persistence with `loadTodos` and `saveTodos` functions. Todos are loaded from localStorage when the application starts and saved to localStorage whenever they change.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state
  
  The code includes multiple instances of conditional rendering, such as hiding the footer when there are no todos, showing the clear completed button only when there are completed todos, and toggling the editing input field based on the editing state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count
  
  The `TodoFooter` component uses a `pluralize` function to correctly display "item" or "items" based on the count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components
  
  The application is well-structured with separate components for different parts of the UI: `TodoApp`, `TodoInput`, `TodoMain`, `TodoList`, `TodoItem`, and `TodoFooter`. Each component has a single responsibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality
  
  The code is organized into a clear directory structure with separate folders for components, hooks, store, and types, following a feature-based organization pattern.
