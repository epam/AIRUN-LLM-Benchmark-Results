# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all React imports use React 18.x compatible syntax  
  All React-related imports are based on the React 18 API. In particular, index.tsx uses createRoot from 'react-dom/client', which is compatible with React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all components use functional component syntax with hooks instead of class components  
  Every component (such as TodoInput, TodoItem, TodoList, TodoMain, TodoFooter, and TodoApp) is implemented as a functional component, utilizing React hooks like useState, useEffect, and useCallback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Redux Toolkit's createSlice is used for state management  
  The state management relies solely on Redux Toolkitâ€™s createSlice (in todosSlice.ts), which confirms the correct usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for all props, state, and Redux store  
  Interfaces and type definitions are defined in files such as src/types/todo.ts and in the props for each component (e.g., TodoInputProps, TodoItemProps). The Redux store and slice states also have explicit types.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses immutable state updates in reducers  
  Although state mutations appear in the reducers, Redux Toolkit (with Immer) enables immutable state updates behind the scenes. The implementation adheres to this pattern.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that nanoid is used for ID generation instead of custom UUID implementation  
  The addTodo reducer clearly uses the nanoid package to generate IDs, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application uses React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate  
  Components such as TodoInput, TodoItem, TodoList, and TodoMain are wrapped with React.memo to optimize rendering performance.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that useCallback is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders  
  Event handlers in multiple components (e.g., handleKeyDown in TodoInput, handleToggle in TodoMain, and others) are wrapped with useCallback to ensure unnecessary re-renders are minimized.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage handling is implemented in a modern way  
  The functions loadTodos and saveTodos in the todosSlice handle localStorage interaction using try-catch blocks for error handling, reflecting modern coding practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows consistent naming conventions throughout the application  
  The naming conventions are consistent across files, components, and variables (e.g., todos, editingId, handleToggle, etc.), ensuring readability and maintainability.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper error handling is implemented where necessary  
  Error handling is implemented in functions interacting with localStorage and in index.tsx where the root container is validated before rendering. This demonstrates appropriate error management.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware  
  The Redux store (in store.ts) is correctly configured with middleware from getDefaultMiddleware along with a customization to disable serializableCheck, indicating proper usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React.lazy is used for code splitting where appropriate  
  The TodoApp component is dynamically imported using React.lazy in index.tsx, fulfilling the code-splitting requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the codebase has no TODOs remaining  
  The implementation is production-ready with no residual TODO comments present in the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux Provider wraps the application entry point  
  The Provider from react-redux is wrapping the application in index.tsx, ensuring the Redux store is accessible throughout the component tree.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure strict TypeScript type checking is implemented throughout the application  
  The codebase uses strict TypeScript types and interfaces in every module, including component props, the Redux store, and application-specific types, ensuring robust type-checking.
