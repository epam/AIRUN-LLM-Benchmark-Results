# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The TodoInput component listens for the Enter key and triggers the onAdd callback when a non-empty input is provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  In TodoMain, a filtering switch is correctly implemented based on the Redux state. The filtered list is then passed to TodoList for display.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  The TodoMain component includes a checkbox (with id "toggle-all") that dispatches the toggleAll action to update all todos' completed state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  The TodoItem component exposes onToggle, onEdit, onSave, and onDestroy callbacks allowing for direct toggling, editing, and deletion of a todo item.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  The TodoItem component assigns the onDoubleClick event to trigger editing mode by invoking the onEdit callback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  In the TodoItem component, the handleKeyDown callback submits the edited todo when the Enter key is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  The TodoItem component handles the Escape key by resetting the edit text to the original todo title and calling the onCancel callback.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooter component displays the count of active (not completed) todos using a strong element.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The TodoFooter component provides clickable links for "All," "Active," and "Completed" filters that update the Redux filter state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  The TodoFooter component conditionally renders a "Clear completed" button when there are any completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  The todosSlice includes loadTodos and saveTodos functions that persist the todos array in localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  The code features conditional rendering in components (e.g., TodoMain does not render if there are no todos; TodoFooter is rendered only if there are active or completed items).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  The TodoFooter uses the helper function pluralize to correctly display "item" vs. "items" depending on the active count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The application is broken down into logically separated components such as TodoInput, TodoItem, TodoList, TodoFooter, and TodoMain, which promotes clarity and reusability.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The provided directory structure organizes code into components, hooks, store, and types, following a clear, feature-based separation.
