# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration
  
  The code uses React 18 features such as `ReactDOM.createRoot()` in `src/index.tsx` and follows Create React App conventions with TypeScript. All files have `.tsx` or `.ts` extensions, and the code structure follows CRA conventions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure
  
  The code includes proper TypeScript interfaces in `src/types.d.ts` for `Note` and `PianoKeyData`, and the `soundMapper` in `src/audio/soundMapper.ts` is correctly typed as `Record<Note, string>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks
  
  All components (App, Piano, PianoKey, ToggleButtons, FullscreenButton) are implemented as functional components using React hooks like `useState`, `useCallback`, `useRef`, and `useEffect`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)
  
  The application uses `useState` for managing state like `showLetters` and `activeNotes`, and `useEffect` for side effects like keyboard event listeners.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels
  
  Keyboard event handlers are appropriately implemented in the App component with `useEffect` to set up and clean up event listeners for keydown and keyup events.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events
  
  Mouse interactions are properly implemented using React synthetic events in the PianoKey component, with handlers for onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseOut, and onMouseEnter.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment
  
  Audio resources are handled correctly using the `soundMapper` object and the Audio API, with appropriate logic to prevent duplicate playback using a Set in `playedRef`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility
  
  The fullscreen functionality is implemented in the `handleFullscreen` callback using useCallback and properly handles browser compatibility with vendor-prefixed methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns
  
  Conditional class application is implemented using the classNames library in both the PianoKey and ToggleButtons components, following React best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate
  
  Performance optimizations are implemented using React.memo for the Piano, PianoKey, ToggleButtons, and FullscreenButton components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations
  
  Audio playback is handled with proper React lifecycle considerations, creating new Audio instances on demand and managing the playback state in a ref to avoid unnecessary rerenders.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application
  
  TypeScript strict typing is followed throughout the application, with proper type definitions for all props, state, functions, and variables. Type assertions are used where necessary (like `as Note`).
