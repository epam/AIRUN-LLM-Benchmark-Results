# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'
  
  The header is correctly implemented in the `App.tsx` component with the class name 'header' and includes an h1 element with the class 'header-title' containing the text "Virtual Piano".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons
  
  The toggle buttons are properly implemented in the `ToggleButtons.tsx` component with a container div having the class 'btn-container' and two buttons with classes 'btn btn-notes' and 'btn btn-letters' respectively.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)
  
  The Piano component in `Piano.tsx` correctly renders 7 white keys (natural notes) and 6 spaces for sharp keys (5 actual sharp keys and 1 disabled placeholder) as defined in the `whiteKeys` and `sharpKeys` arrays.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes
  
  Each PianoKey component correctly sets data attributes `data-note` and `data-letter` based on the provided key data, making them accessible for styling and event handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked
  
  The application loads audio files via the `soundMapper` in `soundMapper.ts` and plays them when keys are clicked through the `playNote` function in `App.tsx`, which creates and plays a new Audio instance.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)
  
  The PianoKey component applies the 'piano-key-active' class conditionally when the key's note is included in the `activeNotes` state array, providing visual feedback when keys are pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes
  
  Keyboard event handlers are set up in `App.tsx` that map specific keys to notes using the `keyToNote` mapping, and trigger `playNote` and `releaseNote` functions appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked
  
  The application maintains a `showLetters` state in `App.tsx` that is toggled by the ToggleButtons component, and this state determines whether piano keys display note names or letter values.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes
  
  The FullscreenButton component calls the `handleFullscreen` function in `App.tsx`, which properly implements cross-browser fullscreen API calls with appropriate fallbacks.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly
  
  The application uses a `playedRef` Set to track currently active notes and the `activeNotes` state array to reflect this in the UI, allowing for multiple simultaneous key presses.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys
  
  Mouse drag functionality is implemented through the combination of `onMouseDown`, `onMouseUp`, `onMouseOut`, and `onMouseEnter` handlers in the PianoKey component, with the `mouseDownRef` tracking the mouse state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information
  
  The footer is correctly implemented in `App.tsx` with the class 'footer' and contains a div with class 'footer-container' displaying the year "2020".
