# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration  
  The code in "src/index.tsx" uses ReactDOM.createRoot, which is an indicator of React 18. The structure and file organization conform to a Create React App with TypeScript project.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure  
  The project includes a dedicated "src/types.d.ts" file that defines interfaces and types for notes and piano key data, and the "src/audio/soundMapper.ts" file utilizes these types.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks  
  All components (PianoKey, Piano, ToggleButtons, FullscreenButton, and App) are implemented as functional components. Hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useCallback are used where appropriate.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)  
  The App component uses useState to manage UI states like activeNotes and showLetters, and useEffect is properly used to register and clean up keyboard event listeners.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels  
  The code sets up keyboard event handlers (keydown and keyup) on the window within a useEffect in the App component, ensuring that key events for playing and releasing notes are handled globally.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events  
  The PianoKey component correctly employs React's synthetic events (onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseOut, onMouseEnter) for handling mouse interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment  
  The audio playback is handled by creating a new Audio instance each time a note is played, and its state is managed properly with currentTime reset to 0. The approach ensures that audio files are mapped correctly and played as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility  
  The FullscreenButton component calls a handler that uses the standard Fullscreen API along with feature detection for older browser prefixes (moz, webkit, ms), which satisfies compatibility concerns.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns  
  The code uses the "classNames" utility to conditionally apply CSS classes in components such as PianoKey and ToggleButtons, adhering to common React patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate  
  Components like PianoKey, Piano, ToggleButtons, and FullscreenButton are wrapped in React.memo to minimize unnecessary re-renders, indicating performance-conscious implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations  
  The audio playback logic is encapsulated within callback functions and state updates in the App component. Additionally, keyboard event listeners are managed and cleaned up using useEffect, aligning with React lifecycle practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application  
  The entire codebase utilizes TypeScript, with strict typing provided via interfaces and type definitions. All props and variables are explicitly typed, which is consistent with a strict TypeScript setup.
