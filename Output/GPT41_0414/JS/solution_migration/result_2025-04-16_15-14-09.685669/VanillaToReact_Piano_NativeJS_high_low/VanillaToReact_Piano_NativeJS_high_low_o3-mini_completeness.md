# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'  
  The App component contains a header element with an h1 whose class is "header-title" and text "Virtual Piano".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons  
  The ToggleButtons component clearly renders two buttons labeled "Notes" and "Letters" within a container.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)  
  The Piano component maps over arrays of white keys and sharp keys, rendering PianoKey components for both types.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes  
  The PianoKey component correctly assigns data-note and data-letter attributes based on the provided props.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked  
  The playNote function creates a new Audio instance using an audio mapping (soundMapper) corresponding to the given note, ensuring the correct audio is played.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)  
  Active piano keys receive the "piano-key-active" class based on the activeNotes state, which visually indicates a pressed key.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes  
  Event listeners for keydown and keyup in App.tsx map keyboard characters to appropriate musical notes, triggering play and release functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked  
  The ToggleButtons component toggles the showLetters state, and the PianoKey component displays either the note or the letter accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes  
  The FullscreenButton component and the handleFullscreen function in App.tsx implement cross-browser logic to enter and exit fullscreen mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly  
  The activeNotes state (an array) and the playedRef set together allow for multiple notes to be active at once without conflict.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys  
  The PianoKey component uses onMouseEnter with a mouseDown boolean check, and the Piano component passes down the relevant event handlers to support smooth drag interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information  
  A footer element exists in App.tsx that displays the year "2020" within a dedicated container.
