# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18.x
  
  The implementation clearly indicates the use of React 18 by importing `createRoot` from 'react-dom/client' in the index.tsx file, which is the React 18 way of rendering applications.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript for type safety
  
  The code extensively uses TypeScript throughout all files with .ts and .tsx extensions, proper type definitions, interfaces, and type annotations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for state management
  
  The application properly implements Redux Toolkit, using `createSlice` in todosSlice.ts to define the reducers and actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm nanoid is used for generating unique IDs
  
  The code correctly imports and uses `nanoid` in the todosSlice.ts file to generate unique IDs for new todo items.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code uses functional components with hooks instead of class components
  
  All components are implemented as functional components using React hooks like useState, useEffect, useRef, etc. There are no class components in the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains the same routing functionality with proper route handling
  
  The application uses react-router-dom v6 with proper routes for 'all', 'active', and 'completed' filters, maintaining the expected routing functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Redux store is properly configured with appropriate slices
  
  The store.ts file correctly configures the Redux store with the todos slice as a reducer.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the Redux provider is set up in the application entry point
  
  The Redux Provider is properly set up in index.tsx, wrapping the App component to provide the store to all components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for all data structures
  
  The code includes well-defined interfaces and types for all data structures, including Todo, FilterType, TodosState, RootState, and AppDispatch.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows React best practices for component composition
  
  The application follows React best practices by breaking the UI into small, reusable components with clear responsibilities, using proper prop types and hooks.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles keyboard events properly
  
  The application properly handles keyboard events such as Enter key for creating/updating todos and Escape key for canceling edits.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application maintains local storage persistence
  
  The application implements local storage persistence with loadTodos and saveTodos functions in todosSlice.ts, maintaining data between sessions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  There are no evident console errors or warnings in the provided code. The code is clean and follows best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application implements proper error handling
  
  The application implements proper error handling, especially for localStorage operations which are wrapped in try/catch blocks.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code is optimized with no unnecessary re-renders
  
  The code uses Redux selectors appropriately to prevent unnecessary re-renders, and the component structure follows best practices for optimization.
