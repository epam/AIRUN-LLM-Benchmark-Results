# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18.x  
  The entry point uses React 18’s createRoot API from "react-dom/client", which is the recommended approach in React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript for type safety  
  The project files use the .ts/.tsx extensions, and interfaces/types (e.g., Todo, FilterType, RootState) are defined, ensuring full TypeScript support.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for state management  
  The code utilizes Redux Toolkit’s createSlice in todosSlice.ts for managing the todos state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm nanoid is used for generating unique IDs  
  The todosSlice.ts file imports and uses nanoid in the prepare callback for generating unique Todo IDs.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code uses functional components with hooks instead of class components  
  All components are defined as functional components using React.FC, and hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, etc.) are employed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains the same routing functionality with proper route handling  
  The code uses react-router-dom v6 with a clear routing structure (e.g., routes for "/all", "/active", and "/completed") and proper redirection.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Redux store is properly configured with appropriate slices  
  The store in src/app/store.ts is configured using configureStore with the todos slice integrated correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the Redux provider is set up in the application entry point  
  The Provider from react-redux wraps the App component in src/index.tsx, ensuring the Redux store is available throughout the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for all data structures  
  Interfaces and types (such as Todo, FilterType, and others in different files) are explicitly declared, ensuring type safety across the codebase.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows React best practices for component composition  
  The application is modular with a clear separation into header, list, item, and footer components, adhering to React’s best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles keyboard events properly  
  The code implements handling for Enter (for adding/updating todos) and Escape (for canceling edits) key events in both TodoHeader.tsx and TodoItem.tsx, ensuring smooth user interaction.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application maintains local storage persistence if implemented  
  LocalStorage persistence is implemented in todosSlice.ts with the loadTodos and saveTodos functions managing data read/write.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  While the code appears well-structured and no console errors or warnings are evident from a static review, this has not been confirmed by running the application. The static analysis suggests a pass.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify the application implements proper error handling  
  Error handling via try/catch is implemented in localStorage access methods. However, since error management is limited primarily to storage operations and not broader application errors, this step is pass with slightly lower confidence.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code is optimized with no unnecessary re-renders  
  The use of React hooks, functional components, and selective useSelector hooks indicate optimization. There is no evidence in the code of unnecessary re-renders.
