# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all required technologies are present: Vite, TypeScript, React, Redux, and React Router  
  All required technologies are clearly integrated. Vite is used as the build tool; TypeScript is configured via tsconfig.json; React is provided along with react-dom; Redux is present through @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux; and routing is handled by react-router-dom.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm documentation includes all available CLI commands with explanations for each command's purpose  
  The documentation features a table that clearly lists all CLI commands (dev, build, preview, test, test:coverage, lint) along with concise explanations for their purposes.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that package.json includes all necessary dependencies for the required technologies  
  The package.json includes all pertinent dependencies and devDependencies for React, Redux, React Router, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, and Vite, ensuring the required technologies are properly supported.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the project contains complete configuration files without placeholder comments or TODOs  
  All configuration files (vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json, .eslintrc.json, .prettierrc, vitest.config.ts) are fully specified with no placeholder comments or incomplete sections.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the presence of proper TypeScript type definitions throughout the project  
  The project properly utilizes TypeScript definitions. Interfaces (e.g., CounterState) are declared, and types are used in the React components and Redux store (e.g., in hooks and store types).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure testing library configuration is complete with necessary setup files  
  The testing setup includes a configuration file (vitest.config.ts) that specifies the testing environment and a setup file (src/setupTests.ts) to extend Jest’s assertions with @testing-library/jest-dom.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the project structure includes directories for components, state management, and routing  
  The structure contains clear directories for pages (components), state management (the store folder with counterSlice and hooks), and routing is integrated in App.tsx using react-router-dom.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the entry point files for the application are properly defined  
  The entry point is correctly defined in public/index.html and src/main.tsx. These files appropriately set up the application’s rendering and integration with Redux and React Router.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all configuration follows established best practices for each technology  
  Best practices are followed in configurations. The Vite, ESLint, and Prettier settings along with TypeScript configurations are set up as per recommended guidelines for modern React projects.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that build and environment configuration supports production deployment  
  The scripts in package.json and the corresponding Vite configuration ensure that the project is fully equipped to build, preview, and deploy a production-ready application.
