# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up in the test file
  
  The test file properly sets up Jest and React Testing Library by including the necessary imports:
  ```tsx
  import { render, screen, fireEvent, within, act } from '@testing-library/react';
  import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';
  ```
  
  It also includes mock setup for Jest.config.js and Jest.setup.js with proper configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test cases are properly isolated and do not have interdependencies
  
  Each test case uses the `renderSelect` helper function to create a fresh instance of the component, and tests are structured with isolated assertions that don't depend on the state from previous tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that DOM events are simulated using proper React Testing Library methods
  
  The test uses proper event simulation methods:
  - `userEvent.click()` for mouse interactions
  - `userEvent.keyboard()` for keyboard inputs
  - `userEvent.type()` for typing
  - `fireEvent` for touch events (`touchStart`, `touchMove`, `touchEnd`)

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that accessibility attributes are being tested appropriately
  
  The test validates accessibility attributes in several places:
  ```tsx
  expect(input).toHaveAttribute('aria-label', 'Fruit select');
  expect(input).toHaveAttribute('aria-labelledby', 'labelledby-id');
  expect(input).toHaveAttribute('aria-errormessage', 'error-id');
  expect(input).toHaveAttribute('aria-invalid', 'true');
  ```

  And also checks for appropriate ARIA roles:
  ```tsx
  expect(input).toHaveAttribute('role', 'combobox');
  expect(screen.getByTestId('menu-list')).toHaveAttribute('role', 'listbox');
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure mocks are used for external dependencies where appropriate
  
  The test properly mocks internal components with detailed implementations:
  ```tsx
  jest.mock('./components/index', () => ({
    defaultComponents: () => ({
      // Detailed mock implementations of all components
    }),
  }));
  
  jest.mock('./components/Menu', () => ({
    MenuPlacer: ({ children, ...props }: any) => children({ ref: jest.fn(), placerProps: { placement: 'bottom', maxHeight: 300 } }),
  }));
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of async/await for asynchronous testing where needed
  
  All user interactions are properly handled with async/await:
  ```tsx
  it('opens menu on control click', async () => {
    renderSelect({ menuIsOpen: false });
    const control = screen.getByTestId('control');
    await userEvent.click(control);
    // assertions
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all assertions use appropriate Jest matchers
  
  The test uses appropriate Jest matchers throughout:
  - `toBeInTheDocument()`
  - `toHaveTextContent()`
  - `toHaveAttribute()`
  - `toHaveClass()`
  - `toHaveLength()`
  - And verification of mock function calls with `expect(onChange).toHaveBeenCalled()`

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that tests include proper cleanup after each test case
  
  While there's no explicit cleanup code visible (like `afterEach`), the test is properly structured to avoid leakage between tests by:
  1. Using a helper function `renderSelect()` that creates fresh instances 
  2. Using separate mock functions for each test
  
  However, the test doesn't explicitly handle cleanup of attached event listeners, which would be ideal to see in some specific cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test descriptions clearly indicate what functionality is being tested
  
  All test cases have clear, descriptive titles that explain what functionality is being tested:
  ```tsx
  it('renders with default props', () => {});
  it('applies required props and accessibility attributes', () => {});
  it('opens menu on control click', async () => {});
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the test file follows best practices for organizing test cases (describe/it blocks)
  
  The test file uses proper organization with a top-level `describe` block for the component and nested `it` blocks grouped by functionality:
  ```tsx
  describe('Select Component', () => {
    // --- Component Rendering Tests ---
    it('renders with default props', () => {});
    
    // --- User Interaction Testing ---
    it('opens menu on control click', async () => {});
    
    // And so on...
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that all event handlers are tested using appropriate simulation methods
  
  The test properly validates event handlers:
  ```tsx
  it('updates value on select', async () => {
    const onChange = jest.fn();
    renderSelect({ menuIsOpen: true, onChange });
    const option = screen.getAllByTestId('option')[1];
    await userEvent.click(option);
    expect(onChange).toHaveBeenCalledWith(OPTIONS[1], expect.anything());
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the test environment correctly simulates both mouse and keyboard interactions
  
  Both mouse and keyboard interactions are properly tested:
  - Mouse: `userEvent.click()`
  - Keyboard: `userEvent.keyboard('{ArrowDown}{ArrowDown}{Enter}')`
  - Typing: `userEvent.type(input, 'Banana')`

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for touch events properly simulate mobile interactions
  
  Touch events are properly simulated with the fireEvent API:
  ```tsx
  fireEvent.touchStart(control, { touches: [{ clientX: 0, clientY: 0 }] });
  fireEvent.touchMove(control, { touches: [{ clientX: 10, clientY: 10 }] });
  fireEvent.touchEnd(control);
  ```
