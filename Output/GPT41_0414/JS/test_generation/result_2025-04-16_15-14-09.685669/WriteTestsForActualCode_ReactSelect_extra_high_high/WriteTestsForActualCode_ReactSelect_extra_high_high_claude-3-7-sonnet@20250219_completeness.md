# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present
- **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented
- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested
- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering
- **Fail** (90%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations

    The test suite provides comprehensive coverage for many props and functionalities, but there doesn't appear to be an explicit test for custom `formatOptionLabel` implementations. While the test suite mocks many component parts and tests various props, including `getOptionLabel` and `formatGroupLabel`, there isn't a specific test that verifies custom formatting of option labels beyond the default behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)
- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)
