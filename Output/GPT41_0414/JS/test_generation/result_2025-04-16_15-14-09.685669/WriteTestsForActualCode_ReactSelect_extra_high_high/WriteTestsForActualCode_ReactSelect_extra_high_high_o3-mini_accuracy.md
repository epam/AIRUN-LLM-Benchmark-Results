# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up in the test file  
  The test file imports and configures Jest along with React Testing Library methods such as render, screen, fireEvent, and userEvent, and it includes a jest.setup.js configuration. This meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test cases are properly isolated and do not have interdependencies  
  Each test case is defined within its own it block under the describe block, and internal dependencies are mocked using jest.mock. This ensures the tests run in isolation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that DOM events are simulated using proper React Testing Library methods  
  The code uses userEvent (e.g., click, keyboard events) and fireEvent for touch events, which are appropriate methods for simulating DOM interactions in tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that accessibility attributes are being tested appropriately  
  The tests include assertions on accessibility attributes such as aria-label, aria-labelledby, aria-errormessage, aria-invalid, role, and aria-expanded, ensuring proper coverage of accessibility features.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure mocks are used for external dependencies where appropriate  
  The test file makes use of jest.mock to mock internal dependencies (like components and MenuPlacer) for isolation and control over test conditions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of async/await for asynchronous testing where needed  
  The test cases dealing with keyboard and click events use async/await along with userEvent, which is the current best practice for handling asynchronous interactions in tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all assertions use appropriate Jest matchers  
  The tests use matchers such as toBeInTheDocument, toHaveTextContent, toHaveAttribute, and toHaveBeenCalled, which are appropriate and standard in Jest assertions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that tests include proper cleanup after each test case  
  React Testing Library (from version 10 onward) automatically cleans up after each test, and the provided test suite structure follows this best practice without needing explicit cleanup code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test descriptions clearly indicate what functionality is being tested  
  Each test has descriptive names (using it blocks) that clearly state the expected behavior, such as "renders with default props" and "applies required props and accessibility attributes," making it easy to understand what is being tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the test file follows best practices for organizing test cases (describe/it blocks)  
  The tests are organized under a single describe block for the Select component with individual it blocks for each scenario, which is a best practice for structuring tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that all event handlers are tested using appropriate simulation methods  
  Event handlers are simulated using userEvent.click, userEvent.keyboard, and fireEvent for touch events, ensuring that the componentâ€™s responses to events are thoroughly tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the test environment correctly simulates both mouse and keyboard interactions  
  The tests simulate mouse interactions (clicking on controls and clear indicators) and keyboard interactions (using userEvent.keyboard with arrow keys and Enter), confirming that both interaction types are accounted for.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for touch events properly simulate mobile interactions  
  The test for touch events uses fireEvent.touchStart, fireEvent.touchMove, and fireEvent.touchEnd to simulate mobile interactions, fulfilling the requirements.
