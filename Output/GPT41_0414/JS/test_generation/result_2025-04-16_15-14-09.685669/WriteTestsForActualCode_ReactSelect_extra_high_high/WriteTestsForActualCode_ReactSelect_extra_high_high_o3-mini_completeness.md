# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist  
  The test "renders with default props" confirms that basic rendering with default props is checked.

- **Fail** (95%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present  
  While there are tests for arrow keys and Enter key interactions (e.g., "navigates options with keyboard" and "selects option with Enter"), tests specifically for Tab navigation and Escape key handling are missing.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)  
  The suite includes multiple tests using click events (e.g., "opens menu on control click", "opens menu on dropdown indicator click", "clears value with clear indicator"); however, there are no tests for hover interactions.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior  
  The tests mainly demonstrate controlled behavior by always providing props like value and onChange. There is no explicit test verifying the behavior of an uncontrolled version of the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values  
  State changes are effectively tested in scenarios such as "selects option with Enter", "updates value on select", "removes value with Backspace", "clears value with clear indicator", and "removes value in multi-select".

- **Fail** (95%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented  
  While there are tests for opening the menu (via control click and dropdown indicator click), explicit tests for menu closing behavior (or for onMenuClose callback functionality) are not present.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality  
  The test "filters options by input" confirms that filtering and search functionality for options works as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist  
  The test "removes value in multi-select" along with multi-prop configurations in other tests ensure that multi-select behavior is covered.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility  
  The test "has correct ARIA attributes" checks for proper ARIA roles and attributes. Additionally, the presence of a live region in the default rendering confirms an attempt to support screen reader compatibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested  
  The test "renders with empty options" ensures that the component properly handles the empty options case.

- **Fail** (95%): Validate tests for loading and error states  
  There is a test for the loading state ("shows loading state"), but no explicit test targets error state handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states  
  The test "disables options" confirms that the component correctly applies disabled attributes via the isOptionDisabled logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance  
  The test "renders large option sets efficiently" illustrates performance under a large set of options.

- **Fail** (85%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested  
  Focus management is partially addressed by calling focus on the control before user interactions; however, there are no dedicated tests verifying that focus shifts appropriately (e.g., when using the Tab key).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering  
  Tests such as "renders with default props" and "applies all props correctly" confirm the correct rendering of placeholders and values.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations  
  There are no tests specifically targeting a custom implementation for formatting option labels (e.g., a custom formatOptionLabel prop).

- **Fail** (90%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)  
  Although tests are provided for onChange and onMenuOpen, there is no explicit test for onInputChange or onMenuClose callbacks.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)  
  The test suite includes specific tests for indicator components. For example, "opens menu on dropdown indicator click" tests the dropdown indicator, "clears value with clear indicator" tests the clear indicator, and "shows loading state" confirms the presence of the loading indicator.
