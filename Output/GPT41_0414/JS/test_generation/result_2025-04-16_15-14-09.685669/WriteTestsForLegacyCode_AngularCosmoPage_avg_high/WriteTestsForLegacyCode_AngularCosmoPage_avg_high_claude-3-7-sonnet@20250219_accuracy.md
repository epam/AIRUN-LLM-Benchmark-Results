# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)
  
  The test suite clearly uses Jasmine as the testing framework and Karma as the test runner, which are modern JavaScript testing tools appropriate for AngularJS applications. This is evidenced by the karma.conf.js configuration and the use of Jasmine syntax (describe, it, beforeEach, expect) throughout the test files.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints
  
  The tests properly mock $resource by using a spy in the beforeEach block:
  ```javascript
  $resource = jasmine.createSpy('$resource').and.callFake(function() {
    return {};
  });
  ```
  The REST API endpoints are correctly handled by creating spy objects for each service method:
  ```javascript
  REST = {
    content: jasmine.createSpyObj('content', ['delete', 'save', 'update']),
    contentRevisions: jasmine.createSpyObj('contentRevisions', ['delete', 'save']),
    // etc.
  };
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation
  
  The tests properly use `beforeEach` hooks to set up the testing environment before each test, including module loading, dependency injection, and mock setup. An `afterEach` hook is also used to clear localStorage after tests:
  ```javascript
  afterEach(function() {
    localStorageMock.clear();
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls
  
  All HTTP requests are properly mocked through the use of spies and mock implementations. The tests do not make real API calls. For example, REST.content.save and REST.content.update are mocked with jasmine spy objects, and callbacks are manually triggered in the tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection
  
  The tests properly use AngularJS dependency injection pattern to inject all required dependencies:
  ```javascript
  beforeEach(inject(function(_REST_, _$resource_, _Page_) {
    REST = _REST_;
    $resource = _$resource_;
    Page = _Page_;
  }));
  ```
  And for controller tests, dependencies are passed through the controller initialization:
  ```javascript
  $controller('pageCtrl', {
    $scope: $scope,
    REST: REST,
    $location: $location,
    // other dependencies
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations
  
  The tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations by using $q to create deferred objects and resolving them in tests:
  ```javascript
  $translateDeferred = $q.defer();
  $translate = jasmine.createSpy('$translate').and.returnValue($translateDeferred.promise);
  ```
  And later resolving them:
  ```javascript
  $translateDeferred.resolve('deleted!');
  $scope.$apply();
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies
  
  The tests use proper spies and mocks for external dependencies such as $resource, $location, $translate, and localStorage:
  ```javascript
  spyOn($location, 'path').and.returnValue('/edit');
  spyOn(window, 'localStorage').and.returnValue(localStorageMock);
  $broadcastSpy = spyOn($rootScope, '$broadcast').and.callThrough();
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization
  
  The tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization, with nested describe blocks for grouping related tests:
  ```javascript
  describe('Controller: pageCtrl', function() {
    // ...
    describe('Initialization', function() {
      it('should initialize $scope.page with Page values', function() {
        // ...
      });
      // ...
    });
    // other describe blocks
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls
  
  The tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls. For example, in the savePage tests:
  ```javascript
  // Success case
  var saveCb = REST.content.save.calls.mostRecent().args[1];
  saveCb({ id: 99 });
  
  // Error case
  var errorCb = REST.content.save.calls.mostRecent().args[2];
  errorCb();
  $translateDeferred.resolve('page_error_saving');
  $scope.$apply();
  expect($broadcastSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith('notify', { message: 'page_error_saving', classes: 'alert-error' });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate
  
  The tests simulate user interactions by calling controller methods that would be triggered by user actions and verifying the expected behavior:
  ```javascript
  $scope.page.title = 'My New Page!';
  $scope.page.url = '';
  $scope.titleChange();
  expect($scope.page.url).toBe('my-new-page');
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage
  
  The tests properly clean up after execution with the afterEach hook that clears localStorage:
  ```javascript
  afterEach(function() {
    localStorageMock.clear();
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested
  
  The tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested:
  ```javascript
  it('should initialize $scope.page with Page values', function() {
    // ...
  });
  
  it('should update Page.title and auto-generate url if autoURL is true', function() {
    // ...
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible
  
  The tests focus on validating function outputs and behavior rather than implementation details:
  ```javascript
  // Testing behavior and output, not implementation
  $scope.deletePage();
  expect(REST.content.delete).toHaveBeenCalledWith({ contentID: 123 }, jasmine.any(Function));
  expect($location.path).toHaveBeenCalledWith('new');
  ```
