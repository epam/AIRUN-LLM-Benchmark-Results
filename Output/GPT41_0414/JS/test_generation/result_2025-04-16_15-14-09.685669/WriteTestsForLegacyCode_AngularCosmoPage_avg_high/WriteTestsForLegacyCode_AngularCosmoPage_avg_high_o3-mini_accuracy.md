# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)  
  The tests are written using Jasmine and are configured to run with Karma. This satisfies the requirement for a modern JavaScript testing framework.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints  
  In the provided test suite (particularly in rest.spec.js), $resource is replaced by a jasmine spy and is used to verify correct endpoint usage, ensuring that REST endpoints are properly mocked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation  
  The tests consistently use beforeEach (and in some cases afterEach) blocks to initialize and clean up state (e.g., clearing localStorage), ensuring that tests do not interfere with one another.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls  
  Although the tests use spies and fake responses for REST API methods (and in some cases mention $httpBackend in the description), there is no explicit use of $httpBackend in every test. However, the mocking approach for external API calls is evident, so this passes with a slight reservation regarding the explicit mocking of HTTP requests in all cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection  
  Dependencies such as Page, REST, $location, $translate, and others are injected using AngularJS DI. This is evident in each test’s use of the inject function and module configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations  
  For example, the $translate promise is handled using a deferred object and resolved appropriately, and $scope.$apply is used to flush pending promise resolutions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies  
  The tests make extensive use of jasmine’s spyOn and createSpyObj to mock dependencies like REST endpoints, $resource, and even global objects (such as localStorage), ensuring isolation from external factors.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization  
  The entire test suite is organized into multiple describe blocks with clear it statements, making it easy to understand what is being tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls  
  The tests cover positive cases (e.g., verifying successful calls and outcomes) as well as error paths (e.g., error callbacks in savePage and updatePage scenarios), ensuring both branches are executed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate  
  Although they are unit tests, the controller tests simulate user interactions—for instance, through the titleChange, urlChange, and descriptionChange functions—to verify that user-triggered changes produce the expected outcomes.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage  
  The tests use an afterEach block (particularly evident in the controller tests) to clear out modifications (like those to localStorage), which prevents state leakage between tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested  
  The naming conventions in both describe and it blocks clearly indicate the purpose and expected behavior of each test case.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible  
  The tests primarily focus on verifying outputs and side effects (such as broadcast events and state changes) rather than testing internal implementation details, aligning with best practices.
