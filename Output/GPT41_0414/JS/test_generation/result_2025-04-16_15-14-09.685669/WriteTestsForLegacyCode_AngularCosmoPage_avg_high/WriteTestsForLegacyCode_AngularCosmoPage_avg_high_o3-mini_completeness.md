# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources  
  The provided test suite for the REST factory verifies that all endpoints (e.g., blocks, content, files, users, etc.) are defined and that $resource is called the expected number of times.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly  
  The Page factory tests confirm that properties such as id, title, description, header, and more are initialized with the expected default values.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly  
  The Users factory tests check every property (id, username, name, bio, email, facebook, twitter, photo, role) for correct default initialization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods  
  The test suite for pageCtrl is extensive, covering initialization, unsaved version detection, local version restoration, deletion, updates, and various other public methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller  
  Tests under the "Initialization" describe block confirm that $scope.page is correctly populated from the Page service, including proper handling on special paths (e.g., '/new').

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation  
  The tests for titleChange check that when autoURL is true, the URL is generated from the title, and when autoURL is false, it is preserved as provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction  
  The saveLocal tests demonstrate that page data is correctly stored in the Page object and synchronized with localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality  
  The autocompleteTags tests cover both successful retrieval of suggestions (via success callback) and error handling by setting suggestions to an empty array.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)  
  Multiple test cases address new page creation, duplicate detection, updating an existing page, and proper error handling for both save and update operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types  
  The tests explicitly verify conditions where the URL is empty or set to an invalid value such as "new," and also handle cases when the page type is not provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly  
  Tests under the "deletePage" describe block confirm that all REST delete calls are executed and that a redirection occurs as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions  
  Through tests for unsaved version detection, localVersion, and deleteNewerVersion functions, the controller’s handling of localStorage-based page versioning is fully verified.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components  
  The suite is extensive and appears designed to cover all public methods and logic branches. Although exact coverage metrics aren’t provided, the comprehensive tests imply high coverage.  
  (Less than 100% confidence because actual code coverage reports are not provided, but the test breadth indicates likely achievement of the target.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling  
  The use of $broadcast in various functions (e.g., notifying on save or deletion) is confirmed via spy checks, ensuring that events are broadcast as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality  
  Tests related to the scheduleDate property confirm correct handling by verifying that dates are appropriately set when not provided or when a new page is started.
