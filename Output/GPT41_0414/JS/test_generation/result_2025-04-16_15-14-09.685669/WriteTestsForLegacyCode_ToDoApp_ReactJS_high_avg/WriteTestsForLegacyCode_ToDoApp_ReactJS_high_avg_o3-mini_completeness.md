# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering  
   The app.test.tsx file contains tests such as "renders header and input" and "renders todos," confirming that component rendering is verified.

2. **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos  
   The test "adds a new todo on enter" in app.test.tsx ensures that new todo addition functionality is covered.

3. **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos  
   The test "calls toggleAll" in app.test.tsx confirms the functionality that toggles all todos is being exercised.

4. **Pass** (95%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos  
   There is a test labeled "filters active/completed/all" in app.test.tsx. Although the simulation of route change and filtering is a bit implicit (by re-rendering and setting props on the mocked Footer component), the test is present. Confidence is 95% because the filtering behavior could be verified more directly.

5. **Fail** (90%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
   While there is a test case labeled "calls clearCompleted" in app.test.tsx, the test does not actively simulate a click event on a clear completed button. It remains commented with instructions on simulating the call; thus, the functionality is not fully verified. Confidence is 90% because the intent is present, but execution is incomplete.

6. **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering  
   The test "renders correctly" in todoItem.test.tsx verifies that the TodoItem component renders as expected.

7. **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos  
   The tests "calls onToggle when checkbox clicked", "calls onDestroy when destroy button clicked", and "calls onEdit on double click" confirm that toggling, destroying, and editing of todos are being properly tested.

8. **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events  
   The tests "calls onSave on enter key" and "calls onCancel on escape key" verify that keyboard interactions are handled appropriately in the component.

9. **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts  
   Tests such as "renders active todo count and pluralizes" and "renders singular for 1 item" in footer.test.tsx confirm that rendering based on count is correctly verified.

10. **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation  
    The test "highlights correct filter" in footer.test.tsx ensures that filter navigation functionality (selection highlighting) is verified.

11. **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
    With tests confirming the visibility of the "Clear completed" button when there are completed items and simulating its click via "calls onClearCompleted when clear button clicked," the footer tests adequately cover this functionality.

12. **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos  
    The todoModel.test.ts file contains tests for addTodo, toggleAll, toggle (single todo), destroy, and save, ensuring this functionality is fully covered.

13. **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions  
    The test "should call subscribers on change" confirms that subscribing to changes and the inform mechanism works as expected.

14. **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
    The test "should clear completed todos" in todoModel.test.ts verifies that clearing of completed items is functioning correctly.

15. **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation  
    The uuid generation functionality is validated by tests checking string length, format (including dashes), and uniqueness.

16. **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality  
    Tests for the pluralize function (both singular and plural cases) are present in utils.test.ts.

17. **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations  
    The store function is tested for storing and retrieving data as well as handling non-existent keys with an empty array, meeting the requirement.

18. **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function  
    The tests for the extend function properly cover merging objects, overriding properties, and handling multiple objects.

19. **Pass** (100%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx  
    The test files follow a consistent naming convention. React component tests use the .test.tsx extension, while non-UI utility tests appropriately use .test.ts (which is acceptable in this context).

20. **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data  
    Sample todo data is provided within tests (for example, in todoModel.test.ts and app.test.tsx), satisfying the fixture requirement.

21. **Pass** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented  
    The routing functionality is simulated in app.test.tsx (with mocks for the Router) and setupTests.ts demonstrates how external dependencies (localStorage, Router) are mocked.
