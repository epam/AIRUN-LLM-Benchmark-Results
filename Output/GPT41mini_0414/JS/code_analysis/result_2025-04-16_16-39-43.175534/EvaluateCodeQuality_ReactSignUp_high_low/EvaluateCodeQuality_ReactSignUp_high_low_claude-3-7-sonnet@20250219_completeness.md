  7. Form Handling Implementation (Issue 7.1)
  8. Component Architecture (Issue 8.1)
  9. API Integration (Issue 9.1)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation approach is thoroughly evaluated
  
  Form validation is thoroughly evaluated in multiple sections, including:
  - Issue 1.2 discusses the complex `asyncValidate` function and suggests improvements
  - Issue 5.1 addresses the outdated `redux-form` API usage
  - Issue 7.1 specifically analyzes the validation approach, pointing out inconsistencies between sync and async validation
  - The evaluation provides detailed code examples for improving both synchronous and asynchronous validation

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure error handling mechanisms are comprehensively assessed
  
  Error handling is comprehensively assessed in multiple sections:
  - Issue 1.3 discusses the problematic promise wrapping in `handleSubmit`
  - Issue 7.1 examines inconsistencies in validation error handling
  - Issue 9.1 specifically addresses API error handling shortcomings
  - The report provides specific improvements using `try/catch`, proper error propagation, and `SubmissionError` from redux-form

- **Pass** (100%): Verify state management for form data is properly analyzed
  
  State management for form data is properly analyzed:
  - Issue 5.1 thoroughly examines the outdated `redux-form` API and provides a modernized approach using `Field` components
  - Issue 8.1 suggests a potential refactoring to functional components with hooks
  - The analysis recognizes the mixed container/presentational concerns in state management (Issue 2.3)
  - Recommendations include proper state handling patterns for both class and functional components

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm component structure and responsibilities are evaluated
  
  Component structure and responsibilities are evaluated in several issues:
  - Issue 2.3 directly addresses the mixing of presentational and container logic
  - Issue 8.1 discusses component architecture and suggests refactoring to functional components
  - Issue 4.2 analyzes the structure of the `FormGroup` component and its responsibilities
  - The evaluation provides recommendations for better separation of concerns and component organization

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure prop usage and component interfaces are reviewed
  
  Prop usage and component interfaces are reviewed extensively:
  - Issue 2.2 specifically addresses incorrect PropTypes definition for `FormGroup`
  - Issue 4.2 analyzes how props are used in the `FormGroup` component
  - Issue 5.1 reviews the interface between `redux-form` and components
  - Multiple code examples demonstrate proper prop interfaces and type checking

- **Pass** (100%): Verify component lifecycle management is analyzed
  
  Component lifecycle management is analyzed:
  - Issue 2.1 addresses the inefficient binding of handlers in render that can affect component lifecycle
  - Issue 8.1 suggests moving to functional components with hooks as a lifecycle management improvement
  - The analysis of `handleSubmit` in Issue 1.3 includes lifecycle implications of promise handling

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm API call patterns and error handling are evaluated
  
  API call patterns and error handling are evaluated thoroughly:
  - Issue 1.2 analyzes the API call patterns in async validation
  - Issue 1.3 examines API patterns in the submit handler
  - Issue 3.1 suggests performance improvements for API calls
  - Issue 9.1 specifically addresses API integration, error handling, and response validation
  - Multiple code examples demonstrate improved API call patterns

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure promise handling and asynchronous operations are assessed
  
  Promise handling and asynchronous operations are assessed in depth:
  - Issue 1.2 analyzes the complex async validation with nested promises
  - Issue 1.3 examines the anti-pattern of wrapping promises
  - Issue 3.1 discusses parallel vs sequential API calls
  - Issue 9.1 addresses error handling in asynchronous operations
  - Multiple code examples demonstrate improved promise handling using async/await and proper error propagation

- **Pass** (100%): Verify specific code examples are provided for suggested improvements
  
  Specific code examples are provided for every suggested improvement:
  - Each issue includes a "Problematic code" section showing the original code
  - Each issue includes a "Corrected code" or "Example" section with specific code examples
  - The examples are detailed and demonstrate the suggested improvements clearly

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm issues are properly categorized by technical aspect
  
  Issues are properly categorized by technical aspect:
  - The report has a clear organization with numbered sections for each aspect
  - Each issue is numbered according to its category (e.g., 1.1, 1.2 for readability issues)
  - A summary table at the end organizes issues by category with key recommendations
  - The categorization is logical and consistent throughout the report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure before/after code examples demonstrate clear improvements
  
  Before/after code examples clearly demonstrate improvements:
  - Each issue has "Problematic code" and "Corrected code" sections
  - The "Why problematic" section explains the issues with the original code
  - The "Fix" section summarizes the improvements
  - The corrected code examples show specific, implementable improvements that address the identified issues
