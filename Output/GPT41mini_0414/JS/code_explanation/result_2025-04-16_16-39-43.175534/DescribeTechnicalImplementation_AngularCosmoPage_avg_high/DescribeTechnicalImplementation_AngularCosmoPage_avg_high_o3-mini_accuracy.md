# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies Angular.js as the framework used  
  The documentation clearly mentions Angular.js components and utilizes Angular constructs like controllers, factories, and directives.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all factories (REST, Page, Users) are accurately documented with their purposes  
  Each factory is detailed in its own section with tables outlining properties, data types, and purposes.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of the Page controller and its functionality is technically accurate  
  The Page Controller is described with its business logic for operations such as creating, editing, and saving pages, as well as managing revisions and tags.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the RESTful API endpoints are correctly documented  
  REST endpoints are thoroughly listed and described in the tables, providing clear insights into their functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of Angular module dependencies ($resource, $location, etc.) is correct  
  The dependencies are properly identified and explained in the context of API communication, routing, and internationalization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the page management features (creating, editing, deleting) are accurately described  
  The documentation details the processes for creating, editing, and deleting pages, including autosave, duplication, and revision handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately explains how the local storage mechanism works
