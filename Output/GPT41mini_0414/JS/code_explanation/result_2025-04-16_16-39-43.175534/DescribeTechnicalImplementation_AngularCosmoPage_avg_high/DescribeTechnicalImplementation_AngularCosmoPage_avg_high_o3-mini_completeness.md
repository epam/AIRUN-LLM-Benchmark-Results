# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation includes a comprehensive component overview explaining the purpose and architecture  
  The documentation starts with a clear "Component Overview" section, providing a detailed explanation of the Angular.js components and their architectural roles. 

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all major components (REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and Page controller) are documented  
  Each of these components is thoroughly documented with individual sections, tables, and descriptions. 

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure all significant features of the page management system are described  
  The documentation lists and explains numerous features including RESTful API communication, global state management, autosave, revision management, and more.

- **Pass** (95%): Check that all form inputs and their behavior are documented  
  The documentation describes the Page Template and UI aspects, mentioning elements like title, description, URL, and bindings (via `ng-model`). However, while it provides context, it does not detail every input’s behavior explicitly. This slight lack of granularity is why the confidence is 95% rather than 100%. 

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page versioning and revision system  
  Revision management is clearly explained, including details on content revisions, extras, and asynchronous saving.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation covers the tag system and autocomplete functionality  
  The tag system and tag autocomplete feature are thoroughly documented, including how suggestions are fetched and updated.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes explanation of error handling and user notifications  
  The documentation covers error handling alongside the notification system integration, describing the use of `$rootScope.$broadcast` for messages and error notifications.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page publishing workflow including scheduling  
  The publishing and scheduling features are explained in the "Page Publishing and Scheduling" section with details on radio button selections and datetime inputs.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation details how content extras and additional metadata are managed  
  There is explicit documentation regarding the handling of extras in both the Page Factory and component features, explaining their role in additional metadata management.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation explains how the UI interacts with the backend APIs  
  The REST factory section and sample usage examples clarify how the UI components communicate with the backend APIs using Angular’s `$resource`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes sample usage examples or patterns  
  Usage examples are provided in both HTML and Angular controller snippets, assisting developers in understanding common usage patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains all significant event broadcasting and inter-component communication  
  The documentation includes a dedicated "Outputs / Events" section that outlines event broadcasting (e.g., `contentGet`, `notify`) and how components communicate.
