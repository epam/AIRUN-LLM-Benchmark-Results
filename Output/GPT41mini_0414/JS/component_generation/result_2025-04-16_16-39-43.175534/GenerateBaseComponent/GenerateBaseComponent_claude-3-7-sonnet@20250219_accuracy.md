# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x
  
  The component uses modern React hooks (useState, useRef, useEffect) and functional component pattern with FC type annotation, which is compatible with React 18.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
  
  The code uses TypeScript with proper type definitions throughout. Interface definitions (SelectOption, SelectProps), type annotations for state variables, event handlers, and refs are all properly defined.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling
  
  The component imports "./index.css" at the top, and a complete CSS file is provided with appropriate styling for all component elements.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments
  
  The code is clean, well-organized, and free of any TODO comments or debug code. It follows a consistent code style and includes appropriate comments explaining functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility
  
  The component correctly uses useState hooks for managing state:
  - `isOpen` for dropdown visibility
  - `searchTerm` for filtering options
  - `highlightedIndex` for keyboard navigation
  These states are properly updated through well-defined functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props
  
  The component accepts numerous customizable props including:
  - `options` for dropdown options
  - `value` and `onChange` for controlled component behavior
  - `placeholder` with default value
  - `id` and `name` for form integration
  - `disabled` flag with default value
  - `ariaLabel` for accessibility

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection
  
  The component implements comprehensive keyboard navigation through the `onKeyDown` handler, supporting:
  - Arrow keys for navigation
  - Enter for selection
  - Escape for closing the dropdown
  The implementation includes proper handling of circular navigation and prevention of default browser behaviors.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions
  
  The component uses refs appropriately:
  - `containerRef` for detecting outside clicks
  - `inputRef` for managing focus
  - `listboxRef` for scrolling highlighted options into view
  DOM interactions are properly handled with React event handlers and useEffect for side effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques
  
  The component handles focus correctly:
  - Maintains focus on input when dropdown closes
  - Manages focus through keyboard navigation
  - Uses explicit focus management in the `closeDropdown` function

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
  
  The component implements extensive ARIA attributes:
  - `role="combobox"` and related attributes for the input
  - `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, `aria-activedescendant` for input-listbox relationship
  - `role="listbox"` and `role="option"` for dropdown items
  - `aria-selected` and `aria-disabled` where appropriate

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  The code appears to be free of potential console errors. However, I'm giving 95% confidence as runtime errors could still occur in edge cases not visible in static code review.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component
  
  The component seems to manage re-renders efficiently:
  - State updates are localized to necessary changes
  - Effects have appropriate dependency arrays
  - Event handlers are defined at the component level
  
  However, without a full performance analysis or memoization check, I'm giving 90% confidence as some optimization opportunities might exist.
