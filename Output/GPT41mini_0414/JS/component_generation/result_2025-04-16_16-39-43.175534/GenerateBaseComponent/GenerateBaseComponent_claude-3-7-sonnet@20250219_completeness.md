# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element
  
  The code defines a React Select component that renders a dropdown UI element with proper styling in the CSS file. It includes input, toggle button, and listbox elements structured to create a dropdown select interface.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown
  
  The component includes a search input functionality through the `onInputChange` handler which sets the search term and filters options based on the input value. The implementation uses the `searchTerm` state variable to filter options with the `filteredOptions` array.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown
  
  The component supports selecting a single item through the `onChange` callback that is called when an option is selected either by mouse click or keyboard. The `onOptionClick` function handles selection and passes the selected value to the parent component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys
  
  The component has keyboard navigation implemented in the `onKeyDown` handler, which specifically handles ArrowUp and ArrowDown keys to navigate through the dropdown options by updating the `highlightedIndex` state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key
  
  The `onKeyDown` handler includes an Enter key case that selects the currently highlighted option by calling `onChange` with the option's value and then closes the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused
  
  The Enter key case in the `onKeyDown` handler includes logic to open the dropdown if it's closed or select an item if it's open, effectively toggling the dropdown state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes
  
  In the `closeDropdown` function, there's an explicit focus call to return focus to the input: `inputRef.current?.focus()`, ensuring focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click
  
  The `onOptionClick` function, which is called when an option is clicked, calls `onChange` with the selected option's value and then calls `closeDropdown()`, ensuring the dropdown closes after selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard
  
  In the Enter key case of the `onKeyDown` handler, after selecting an option, `closeDropdown()` is called, ensuring the dropdown closes after keyboard selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed
  
  The Escape key case in the `onKeyDown` handler calls `closeDropdown()` when the dropdown is open, ensuring it closes on Escape key press.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component
  
  The component uses a `useEffect` hook with a click listener on the document that checks if the click was outside the component container. If so and the dropdown is open, it calls `closeDropdown()`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused
  
  The Enter key case in the `onKeyDown` handler includes an else condition that calls `openDropdown()` when the dropdown is not currently open, enabling the Enter key to open the dropdown.
