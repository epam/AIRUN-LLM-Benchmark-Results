# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  Although the code does not explicitly specify the React version, it uses React hooks and React.FC which are fully compatible with React 18.x. Without access to package metadata, we assume it is intended for React 18.x.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  The code is in a .tsx file, employs proper interface/type definitions for props and state, and uses type annotations (e.g., for useRef and event handlers), which confirms it is written in TypeScript.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  The provided answer includes a separate index.css file that styles the component, fulfilling this step.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  The code is well organized without any leftover TODO comments or debugging code, indicating production readiness.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  State management is handled via React’s useState hook for controlling the dropdown’s open/close state, search term, and highlighted index. This meets best practices for handling UI state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  The component accepts a range of customizable props, including options, value, onChange callbacks, placeholder, id, name, disabled, and ariaLabel, making it highly reusable.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  The component handles keyboard events (ArrowDown, ArrowUp, Enter, Escape) inside the onKeyDown handler, facilitating navigation and selection compliant with common accessibility patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  The use of refs via useRef for the container, input, and listbox along with proper cleanup in useEffect for event listeners demonstrates adherence to best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  The component manages focus appropriately by refocusing the input after closing the dropdown, supporting a better user experience.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  ARIA attributes (e.g., role="combobox", aria-expanded, aria-activedescendant, role="listbox", and role="option") are implemented correctly to meet accessibility standards.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  Based on the static code review, no potential issues that would cause console errors or warnings are apparent. (Note: Actual runtime verification is recommended.)

- **Pass** (90%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  While inline functions (in event handlers) may typically raise concerns about re-renders, this pattern is common in controlled components. There is no clear sign of performance issues from the provided snippet. However, further profiling in a production environment would be needed to completely rule out unnecessary re-renders.
