# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component conditionally renders a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> element with the class "select-listbox" when <code>isOpen</code> is true. It also includes a button to toggle the dropdown, confirming that it renders a dropdown UI element.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  The component uses an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element with appropriate event handlers (<code>onChange</code> and <code>onKeyDown</code>) to act as a search field. The filtering logic based on <code>searchTerm</code> confirms the presence and functionality of a search input.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The props include a <code>value</code> (of type <code>string</code>) and an <code>onChange</code> callback for selection. The code handles selection by calling <code>onChange</code> with the selected option’s value, thereby supporting single-item selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The <code>onKeyDown</code> event handler processes both <code>ArrowDown</code> and <code>ArrowUp</code> keys to adjust the highlighted index, allowing keyboard navigation through the dropdown items.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  Within the <code>onKeyDown</code> handler, pressing the <code>Enter</code> key selects the currently highlighted item (if any) and calls <code>onChange</code>, then closes the dropdown.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  When the component is focused, pressing <code>Enter</code> triggers the <code>onKeyDown</code> handler which will either open the dropdown (if closed) or select an item (if open) and then close it. While the behavior is not a traditional toggle (i.e. open when pressing Enter and then close without selecting an item), it effectively changes the dropdown’s visibility. The slight variance in behavior causes a confidence level of 95%.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  The <code>closeDropdown</code> function calls <code>inputRef.current?.focus()</code>, ensuring that focus is restored to the select component once the dropdown is closed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  Clicking on an option triggers the <code>onOptionClick</code> function, which calls <code>closeDropdown()</code> after selecting the item, thereby closing the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  When an item is selected using the <code>Enter</code> key (via keyboard), the code calls <code>closeDropdown()</code> immediately after processing the selection, ensuring the dropdown is closed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  The <code>onKeyDown</code> handler listens for the <code>Escape</code> key and calls <code>closeDropdown()</code> if the dropdown is open, meeting this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  A <code>useEffect</code> hook adds a document-level event listener that detects clicks outside the dropdown’s container and calls <code>closeDropdown()</code> as needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  When the dropdown is closed and the component is focused, pressing the <code>Enter</code> key triggers the <code>onKeyDown</code> handler that calls <code>openDropdown()</code>, thereby opening the dropdown.
