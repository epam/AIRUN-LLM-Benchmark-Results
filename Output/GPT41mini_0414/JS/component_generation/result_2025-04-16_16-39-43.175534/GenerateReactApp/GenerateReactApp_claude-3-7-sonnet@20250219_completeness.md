# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The application fetches character data from the SWAPI API using axios at `https://swapi.dev/api/people` and displays the results in a list.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The application uses a loading state and conditional rendering to display "Loading characters..." while data is being fetched.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The application maps through all character data from the API response using `characters.map()` and renders each name in an unordered list.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  The code doesn't contain any search functionality, filters, or user input fields.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character is displayed in a list item showing the character's name. The code extracts `name` from each character object and displays it within a `<li>` element.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The package.json includes "react-scripts" as a dependency with scripts for start, build, test, and eject, which is the standard configuration for Create React App projects.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The application properly manages three states using React's useState hook:
  - `characters` state for the character data
  - `loading` state to indicate when data is being fetched
  - `error` state to capture and display error messages

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each list item has a unique key attribute using the character's URL: `<li key={url} ...>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  The application has three conditional rendering branches:
  - Loading state
  - Error state
  - Data display state
  
  If the characters array is empty after loading completes without errors, it will render the list container but no list items, which is appropriate behavior.
