# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The application fetches character data from "https://swapi.dev/api/people" and maps over the results to render a list of character names.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The component conditionally renders a "Loading characters..." message when the loading state is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  After fetching data, the characters are stored in state and then rendered in a list. All characters in the fetched "results" array are displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  There are no components or elements that indicate the presence of search functionality or any user input fields.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each list item shows the character's name and uses the character's URL as a unique key.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The presence of "react-scripts" in package.json, the directory structure (src, public), and the use of TypeScript with CRA configurations indicate that Create React App was used.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The code uses Reactâ€™s useState hook to maintain separate states for loading, error, and the characters data, providing clear state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  Each character list item is rendered with a unique key (the character's URL), which is appropriate for React list rendering.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  While the application renders a list of characters when data is available, it does not specifically handle the case where the characters array is empty (e.g., by displaying a "No characters found" message). This absence of explicit empty state handling is considered a shortcoming.
