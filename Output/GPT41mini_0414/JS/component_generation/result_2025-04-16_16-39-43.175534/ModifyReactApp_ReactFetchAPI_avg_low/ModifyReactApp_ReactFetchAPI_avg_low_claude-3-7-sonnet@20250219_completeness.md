# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name
    
    The code includes a clearly labeled search input field that filters Star Wars characters by name. The input element has appropriate attributes including id, type="search", placeholder text, and aria-label for accessibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests
    
    The code includes a loading indicator with proper accessibility attributes (role="status" and aria-live="polite") that displays "Loading..." text when the `loading` state is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query
    
    The code uses a useEffect hook that calls `fetchCharacters` when the component mounts and whenever the debouncedQuery changes. The initial state of debouncedQuery is an empty string, which triggers the initial data load on component mount.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type
    
    The code implements debounced search functionality with a 500ms delay using the DEBOUNCE_DELAY_MS constant. As users type, the searchQuery state updates immediately, while a separate useEffect updates the debouncedQuery after the delay, which then triggers a new API request.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found
    
    The code includes conditional rendering that displays "No characters found." when the characters array is empty and the component is neither loading nor in an error state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design
    
    The search component uses responsive design principles including percentage-based widths, max-width constraints, and box-sizing: border-box. The container has a maxWidth of 600px with auto margins, and the input field uses width: "100%" to adapt to the container size.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response
    
    The code handles the API response appropriately, setting the characters state with the results from the API and displaying them in a list. Each character is rendered as a list item with the character's name.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed
    
    The code includes a well-implemented ErrorBoundary component that catches JavaScript errors anywhere in the child component tree. The ErrorBoundary displays a user-friendly error message when an error occurs.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props
    
    The code defines comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all necessary data structures and component props, including Character, SwapiResponse, ErrorBoundaryProps, ErrorBoundaryState, and proper type annotations for all state variables and function parameters.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities
    
    The application correctly implements all the expected functionality: it fetches and displays Star Wars characters, provides search capability, handles loading states, error states, and empty results, all while maintaining proper TypeScript typing and React best practices.
