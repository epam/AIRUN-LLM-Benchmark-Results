# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type  
  The input field is bound to the state variable (searchQuery) and its onChange handler correctly updates the state by calling setSearchQuery with the inputâ€™s value.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls  
  The code uses a useEffect hook to debounce the search query with a delay defined by DEBOUNCE_DELAY_MS = 500, which falls in the expected range.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured  
  Axios is imported and utilized in an async function (fetchCharacters) that correctly configures the GET request along with potential search parameters.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses  
  Interfaces are defined for API responses, component props, and state. Function parameters (like ChangeEvent) and component signatures (React.FC) are properly typed throughout the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters  
  The API endpoint ("https://swapi.dev/api/people") is constructed with optional search parameters. When the query exists, it is passed via the params object as { search: query }.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate  
  The code uses useMemo to memoize the rendering of the characters list and useCallback for both the fetchCharacters and onSearchChange functions, effectively minimizing unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback  
  Error handling is present in the try-catch block within fetchCharacters. Errors are caught, an appropriate message is set in the state, and the user is provided feedback via a rendered alert message.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing  
  The debouncing effect ensures that the API call (via fetchCharacters) is triggered only after the user stops typing for 500ms, rather than on every keystroke.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices  
  The components make proper use of React hooks (useState, useEffect) for state management, and state variables are clearly separated for search queries, debounced queries, loading state, characters, and error messages.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code  
  A careful review shows that all imported dependencies are used effectively. The commented-out code within componentDidCatch does not affect functionality and is acceptable for potential future logging purposes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests  
  The loading indicator is correctly managed: loading is set to true at the start of the API call and finally set to false, with a corresponding loading message rendered when appropriate.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns  
  The implementation leverages modern React hooks and functional components where applicable, and although ErrorBoundary is implemented as a class component, it remains a valid and recommended pattern in React 18. The overall design is consistent with current best practices.
