# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The code includes an <input> element with id "character-search" and type "search". The onChange handler updates the search query, which in turn is used to filter character results.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  The component renders a div with the role "status" and the text "Loading..." when the loading state is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  On component mount, the default empty search input (after trimming) triggers the useEffect that calls fetchCharacters, thereby loading the initial data.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  The onSearchChange callback updates the search query state, which is debounced and eventually triggers a new API call, ensuring that search results are updated dynamically.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  When no characters are returned (and there is no loading or error state), the memoized charactersList returns a styled list item displaying "No characters found."

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The component uses inline styles with width set to "100%" for the search input and a container with maxWidth and auto margins, which contributes to a responsive layout.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  After a successful API call, the component updates the characters state and renders them as a list of <li> elements, displaying the search results correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  An ErrorBoundary class component is provided, which wraps the CharacterList in the App component to catch and display errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The code defines TypeScript interfaces for Character, SwapiResponse, ErrorBoundaryProps, ErrorBoundaryState, and properly uses types from React and axios.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The application still performs the initial data load and displays character information, while the search functionality has been added without disrupting the original behavior.  
  Although the integration appears seamless, a slight uncertainty (10%) remains, as without a controlled environment run it is assumed that all edge cases are handled as intended.
