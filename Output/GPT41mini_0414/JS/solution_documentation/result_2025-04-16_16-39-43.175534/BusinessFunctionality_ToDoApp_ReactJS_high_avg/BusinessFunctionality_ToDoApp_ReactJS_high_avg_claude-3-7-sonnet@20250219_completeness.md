# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers all main functionality including adding, editing, deleting, and toggling todos
  
  The document clearly covers all the main functionality in the first section "Business Requirements Analysis" under "Main Functionality and Features" and elaborates further in the "User Interaction Patterns" section.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about filtering todos by status (all, active, completed)
  
  Filtering functionality is explicitly mentioned in multiple sections, including "Main Functionality and Features," "User-Facing Features and Interaction Points," and the structured summary table.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the user workflow for creating new todo items
  
  The user workflow for creating new todo items is described in the "Expected User Workflow and Experience" section where it states "User adds new todos via input field" and in "User-Facing Features" where it specifies "Add Todo: Input field at top; user types and presses Enter to add."

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the editing functionality triggered by double-clicking
  
  The document explicitly mentions the double-click editing functionality in multiple places, including "User-Facing Features" section: "Edit Todo: Double-click todo label to enter edit mode; edit inline" and under "UI/UX Patterns Implemented": "Inline Editing: Double-click to edit, with keyboard shortcuts for save/cancel."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the clear completed functionality
  
  The clear completed functionality is covered in the document in multiple sections, including "Main Functionality and Features," "Core Components and Their Relationships," and "User-Facing Features and Interaction Points."

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the toggle all functionality
  
  Toggle all functionality is described in several places, including "Main Functionality and Features" ("Bulk Actions: Users can toggle all todos as complete/incomplete"), "User-Facing Features" ("Toggle All: Checkbox to mark all todos complete or incomplete"), and "Secondary Objectives / Use Cases" ("Support bulk operations to save user time (toggle all, clear completed)").

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the counter for remaining items
  
  The counter for remaining items is mentioned in the "Core Components and Their Relationships" section under "TodoFooter": "Displays count of active todos."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the persistent storage of todos
  
  Persistent storage is mentioned in multiple places, including "Main Functionality and Features" ("Persistence: Todos are persisted in localStorage under a specific namespace"), "Data Flow and State Management," and the "Technical Stack" in the summary table.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the UI components and their relationships
  
  The document provides detailed descriptions of the UI components and their relationships in the "Core Components and Their Relationships" section, which outlines TodoApp, TodoModel, TodoItem, TodoFooter, and Utils components along with their responsibilities and interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the business objectives addressed by the application
  
  Business objectives are explicitly covered in the "Business Objectives Extracted" section, which includes primary business goals, secondary objectives, and how the technical implementation aligns with these business needs.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes performance and scalability considerations
  
  Performance and scalability considerations are thoroughly covered in the "Performance and Scalability Considerations" section, which includes performance optimizations, scalability approaches and limitations, and efficiency patterns or concerns.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes technical constraints and limitations
  
  Technical constraints and limitations are detailed in the "Constraints and Assumptions" section, which covers technical limitations, architectural assumptions, and dependencies.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the document covers the pluralization of item/items text based on count
  
  The document mentions pluralization functionality in the "Core Components and Their Relationships" section under "Utils": "Provides utility functions: UUID generation, pluralization, localStorage wrapper, and object extension." However, it doesn't explicitly connect this to the item/items text based on count in the UI, which would have made this coverage more complete.
