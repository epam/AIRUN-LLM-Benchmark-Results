# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props
  
  The code consistently uses TypeScript throughout all components with proper type annotations for variables, functions, props, and state. Examples include properly typed interfaces like `PageState`, `UsersState`, `TagSuggestionsProps`, and proper type definitions for API responses and function parameters.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management
  
  The code uses Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` for state management as evidenced in `pageSlice.ts` and `usersSlice.ts`. The store is properly configured with `configureStore` in `store.ts`, and typed hooks for accessing the store are provided in `hooks.ts`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components
  
  All React components in the code (PageEditor, TagSuggestions, PublishRadioGroup, PageContainer, AppRoutes) are implemented as functional components using the `React.FC` type annotation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately
  
  The code demonstrates appropriate use of React hooks throughout. For example, in the `PageEditor` component, `useState` is used for local storage values, `useEffect` for side effects like checking newer versions, and `useCallback` for memoized functions like `revertLocalVersion` and `deleteNewerVersion`.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource
  
  The code uses axios for API communication, as shown in the `restApi.ts` file, which creates an axios instance and defines typed endpoints for various API operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components
  
  Form handling in the `PageEditor` component uses controlled components. All form inputs have their values tied to Redux state and onChange handlers that dispatch actions to update state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation
  
  React Router v6 is implemented in the `AppRoutes.tsx` file with proper route definitions, and hooks like `useParams` and `useNavigate` are used in the components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization
  
  The code uses `react-i18next` for internationalization, with proper setup in `i18n/index.ts` and usage of the `useTranslation` hook in components like `PageEditor` and `PublishRadioGroup`.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization
  
  Code splitting is implemented in the `AppRoutes.tsx` file using React's lazy loading and Suspense components for dynamic imports of the PageContainer component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations
  
  React.memo is used appropriately on potentially expensive components like `TagSuggestions`, `PublishRadioGroup`, and `PageEditor` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks
  
  All useEffect hooks and other hooks like useCallback have proper dependency arrays. For example, in `PageEditor.tsx`, the useEffect for checking newer versions has dependencies [dispatch, page, routeUrl], and the useCallback functions have appropriate dependencies.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models
  
  TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models including `Content`, `Tag` in the API layer, `PageState` and `UsersState` for Redux slices, and component props like `TagSuggestionsProps` and `PublishRadioGroupProps`.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state
  
  Redux selectors are used via the typed `useAppSelector` hook from `hooks.ts` to access state in components like `PageEditor` and `PageContainer`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations
  
  Action creators are properly implemented using Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` in both `pageSlice.ts` and `usersSlice.ts`, with exports of the generated action creators like `updateTitle`, `setTags`, etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks
  
  Local storage functionality is implemented using a custom hook `useLocalStorage` in `localStorage.ts` that provides a convenient API for storing and retrieving data from localStorage, with proper state synchronization.
