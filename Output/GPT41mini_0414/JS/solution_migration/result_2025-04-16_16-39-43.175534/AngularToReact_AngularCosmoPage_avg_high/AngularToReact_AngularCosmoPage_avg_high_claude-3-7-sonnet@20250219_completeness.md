# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented

    The code includes implementations for creating a new page, updating an existing page, duplicating a page, and deleting a page. These functionalities are primarily found in the PageEditor component where `onSavePage()` handles create/update/duplicate with proper API calls using restApi.saveContent and restApi.updateContent. Delete functionality is also referenced with a button that would trigger confirmation logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present

    Page type selection is implemented with a select dropdown in the PageEditor component. The component maps through available theme pages and handles changes with the onTypeChange function that dispatches updateType action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists

    URL auto-generation from the title is implemented in the onTitleChange handler within the PageEditor component. It checks if autoURL is true or if the URL is empty/new, then converts the title to a URL-friendly format by removing special characters and replacing spaces with hyphens.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented

    Tag management is fully implemented with the TagSuggestions component and corresponding handlers in PageEditor. The onTagsChange function processes entered tags, while the system fetches and displays suggestions using restApi.queryTags. Users can select suggestions, which are then incorporated into the tags array.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available

    The PublishRadioGroup component implements the three publish status options: publish ('Y'), draft ('N'), and schedule. These are controlled via radio buttons with proper state management and translations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented

    Scheduled publishing is implemented with a datetime-local input that appears when the 'schedule' option is selected. The component handles the schedule date with proper state management using updateScheduleDate action. When saving, the code properly converts the schedule date to a timestamp and handles the publishing logic based on whether the scheduled time is in the past or future.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present

    Local storage functionality for detecting newer versions is implemented with the useLocalStorage hook and corresponding logic in PageEditor. The component checks localStorage values on mount to determine if there's a newer version and provides options to use, compare, or discard the local version with dedicated handlers (revertLocalVersion and deleteNewerVersion).

- **Pass** (90%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented

    The code includes alerts for success and error messages when saving pages and for validation errors. However, it uses basic browser alerts rather than a more sophisticated notification system, which might be what was in the original code. The translation keys for messages are preserved.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present

    Form validation is implemented in the onSavePage function where it checks if the page type is selected, if the title exists, and if the URL is valid before proceeding with the save operation. Appropriate error messages are displayed using alerts with translated text.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled

    The restApi.ts file comprehensively covers all the API endpoints mentioned, including content management, tags, extras, and revisions. The implementation uses axios with proper typing and endpoint structure.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented

    The API endpoints for extras management are defined in restApi.ts with proper methods for getting, saving, and deleting extras. The PageState includes an extras property, and the Redux store handles setting extras with the setExtras action. However, the UI components for managing extras aren't fully detailed in the provided code snippets.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained

    The API endpoints for revision management are defined in restApi.ts, including saving and deleting revisions. However, the UI for viewing and managing revisions isn't fully detailed in the provided code snippets.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components

    The code is well-organized using a feature folder structure with clear separation of concerns. Business logic is in slices and API modules, while UI components are separate. The project structure follows modern React best practices with api/, app/, features/, i18n/, routes/, and utils/ directories.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved

    Translation functionality is implemented using react-i18next. The code preserves translation keys from the original application and properly applies the useTranslation hook to translate UI elements.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters

    The routing system in AppRoutes.tsx maintains the same URL structure with paths for new pages (/new) and existing pages (/:url). The navigation logic in components like PageEditor preserves these URL patterns when redirecting after actions.
