# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling
  
  The SignupComponent clearly uses Angular's Reactive Forms API. This is evident from the form initialization in the ngOnInit method using FormBuilder to create a FormGroup, and the corresponding form binding in the HTML template with [formGroup] and formControlName directives.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)
  
  The form control validations correctly implement all required synchronous validations:
  - Name: Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3), Validators.maxLength(60)
  - Email: Validators.required, Validators.email
  - Password: Validators.required, Validators.minLength(6)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use
  
  The component implements AsyncValidatorFn for both name and email fields that call the API service methods isName() and isEmail() respectively, with appropriate debounce timing using timer(500).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched
  
  The FormGroupComponent applies conditional CSS classes based on control.touched and control.invalid states:
  - Uses 'has-error' class for invalid touched controls
  - Uses 'has-success' class for valid touched controls
  - Shows error messages only when controls are both touched and invalid

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions
  
  The onSubmit method properly:
  1. Validates the form before submission
  2. Sets loading state via submitting = true
  3. Extracts form values
  4. Dispatches the SignupActions.signup action with user data
  5. Sets up subscriptions to handle success/failure outcomes

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails
  
  The FormGroupComponent displays appropriate error messages through the errorMessage getter and the error message is shown in the help-block div when showError is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service
  
  The DocumentTitleComponent correctly uses Angular's Title service to set the document title on initialization and restore the original title on component destruction.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management
  
  The code properly implements NgRx with:
  - Action creators in signup.actions.ts
  - Effects for handling API calls in signup.effects.ts
  - Store dispatch and select in the component

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress
  
  The submit button has [disabled]="submitting" binding that disables the button when submitting is true, which is set during form submission.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses
  
  The SignupEffects properly handles API responses:
  - Success: maps to signupSuccess action
  - Error: catches and maps to signupFailure action
  
  The component also subscribes to both success and error states to handle UI updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management
  
  The components follow Angular best practices:
  - Using OnInit, OnDestroy lifecycle hooks appropriately
  - Using ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush for better performance
  - Proper input property declarations
  - Clean separation of concerns between components

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises
  
  The ApiService correctly uses Angular's HttpClient for all API calls, working with Observables rather than Promises.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements
  
  The FormGroupComponent's errorMessage getter correctly handles all required validation error types (required, minlength, maxlength, email, nameTaken, emailTaken) and provides appropriate user-friendly messages.
