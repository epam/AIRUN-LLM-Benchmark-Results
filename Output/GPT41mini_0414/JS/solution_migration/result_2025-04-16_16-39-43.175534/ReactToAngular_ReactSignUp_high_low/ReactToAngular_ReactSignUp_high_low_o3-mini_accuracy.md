# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The SignupComponent imports FormBuilder and sets up a FormGroup via this.fb.group(), confirming the use of Angular's Reactive Forms.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The signup form includes Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3), Validators.maxLength(60) for the name field, Validators.email for the email field, and Validators.minLength(6) for the password field.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  The implementation provides async validators (nameAsyncValidator and emailAsyncValidator) that call the respective ApiService methods to check name and email availability.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The FormGroupComponent uses the properties "showError" and "bsClass" to control the display of error messages and styling, providing user feedback based on control state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  Upon form submission, if the form is valid, the component dispatches the signup action from SignupActions, which then triggers the effect to call the ApiService.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The FormGroupComponent template includes an element that conditionally displays error messages based on validation failures, ensuring users see guidance when input is invalid.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  The DocumentTitleComponent sets the page title in ngOnInit via Angular’s Title service and restores the original title in ngOnDestroy.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The code demonstrates state management by dispatching actions via @ngrx/store and handling side effects in the signup.effects.ts using @ngrx/effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button in the signup component template is bound to the "submitting" flag, disabling it when a submission is underway.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  The signup effect handles API responses by mapping a successful result to SignupActions.signupSuccess and catching errors to dispatch SignupActions.signupFailure.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The code is well-structured with a clear separation of concerns (actions, effects, and component logic) and proper use of lifecycle hooks such as ngOnInit and ngOnDestroy.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The ApiService makes use of Angular’s HttpClient to send HTTP requests, conforming to Angular’s recommended practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The FormGroupComponent dynamically generates error messages for required, minlength, maxlength, email validation, and checks for taken names/emails, fulfilling the specified criteria.
