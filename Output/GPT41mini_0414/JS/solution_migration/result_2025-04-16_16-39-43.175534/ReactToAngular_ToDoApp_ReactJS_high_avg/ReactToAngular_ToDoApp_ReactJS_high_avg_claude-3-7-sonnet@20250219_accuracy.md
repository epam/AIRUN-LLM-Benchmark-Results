# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The code consistently uses Angular patterns, decorators, and APIs that are compatible with Angular 14.x. The answer mentions "Migration to Angular 14.x" and the implementation includes proper Angular module structure, component decorators, and dependency injection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
  
  The code includes proper NgRx store implementation with imports from '@ngrx/store', proper setup in the app.module.ts, and usage of Store in components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
  
  The code includes TodoEffects class with proper NgRx effects implementation for handling side effects like loading todos and persisting changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
  
  The code shows well-structured actions (todo.actions.ts), reducers (todo.reducer.ts), and selectors (todo.selectors.ts) with proper implementations for all required operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
  
  All components use proper @Component decorators, and child components like TodoItemComponent use @Input and @Output decorators for communication.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators
  
  React refs are properly replaced with Angular's @ViewChild decorators, as seen in:
  ```typescript
  @ViewChild('newField', { static: false }) newField!: ElementRef<HTMLInputElement>;
  @ViewChild('editField') editField!: ElementRef<HTMLInputElement>;
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
  
  The TodoItemComponent properly uses @Input() for receiving data and @Output() EventEmitter for sending events back to the parent component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
  
  The code includes properly implemented Angular services for handling data and business logic:
  - TodoService for data persistence
  - UtilsService for utility functions

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
  
  Dependency injection is properly implemented with services marked with @Injectable({providedIn: 'root'}) and components receiving dependencies through their constructors.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
  
  The components use OnPush change detection strategy when appropriate:
  ```typescript
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
  
  Angular Router is properly implemented with:
  - app-routing.module.ts for main routes
  - todos-routing.module.ts for feature routes
  - RouterModule imports and exports
  - routerLink directives in templates

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code follows Angular style guide conventions with proper:
  - File and folder structure
  - Naming conventions
  - Feature modules
  - Component structure
  - Service implementation

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
  
  TypeScript interfaces and types are well-defined and used throughout the application:
  ```typescript
  export interface ITodo {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    completed: boolean;
  }
  
  export type Filter = 'all' | 'active' | 'completed';
  
  export interface ITodoState {
    todos: ITodo[];
    filter: Filter;
    editingId: string | null;
  }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
  
  The code includes proper Angular HTML templates with Angular-specific syntax for:
  - Data binding with {{}}
  - Event binding with ()
  - Property binding with []
  - Structural directives (*ngIf, *ngFor)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
  
  React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings:
  ```html
  (keydown)="onNewTodoKeyDown($event)"
  (change)="onToggleAll($event)"
  (click)="onClearCompleted()"
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs
  
  There are no TODO comments in the code, and the answer explicitly mentions "No TODOs: All code is production-ready and clean."

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules
  
  Lazy loading is properly implemented in the app-routing.module.ts:
  ```typescript
  {
    path: '',
    loadChildren: () =>
      import('./todos/todos.module').then(m => m.TodosModule),
  }
  ```
