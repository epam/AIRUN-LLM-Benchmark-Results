# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items
    
    The application correctly displays all todo items through the `filteredTodos$` observable in the TodoAppComponent, which is rendered in the template using `*ngFor="let todo of filteredTodos$ | async"`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented
    
    The code implements adding new todo items through the `onNewTodoKeyDown` method in TodoAppComponent which dispatches the `addTodo` action when the user presses Enter in the input field.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works
    
    Toggling todo items is implemented through the `toggleTodo` action which is dispatched from the TodoItemComponent via the `toggle` output event.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented
    
    Editing is fully implemented with double-click to edit, blur and Enter to save, and Escape to cancel in the TodoItemComponent. The editing state is tracked in the NgRx store via the `editingId` property.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented
    
    Todo item deletion is implemented through the `destroy` output in TodoItemComponent which dispatches the `deleteTodo` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented
    
    The 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented through the `onToggleAll` method in TodoAppComponent which dispatches the `toggleAll` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works
    
    Filtering is implemented through:
    1. The Angular Router with routes for '/', '/active', and '/completed'
    2. The `selectFilteredTodos` selector that filters todos based on the current filter
    3. The filter is synced with the route in the NgOnInit of TodoAppComponent

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items
    
    The footer displays the active item count through the `count` input passed to TodoFooterComponent which is bound to the `activeCount$` observable.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items
    
    The 'Clear completed' button functionality is implemented through the `clearCompleted` output event in TodoFooterComponent which triggers the `onClearCompleted` method in TodoAppComponent that dispatches the `clearCompleted` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage
    
    Todo items are persisted to localStorage through the TodoService's `saveTodos` method, which is called whenever the todos$ observable changes in the TodoAppComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation
    
    The URL structure is maintained through the Angular Router configuration which maps '/', '/active', and '/completed' routes to the TodoAppComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states
    
    The application handles empty states through NgIf directives:
    - `*ngIf="(todos$ | async)?.length > 0"` for the main section
    - `*ngIf="(activeCount$ | async) + (completedCount$ | async) > 0"` for the footer

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly
    
    Form submissions are handled correctly:
    - Adding todos through the Enter key in the input field
    - Saving edits through Enter key or blur event
    - Canceling edits through Escape key

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships
    
    The component relationships are maintained through a well-structured hierarchy:
    - TodoAppComponent as the parent component
    - TodoItemComponent and TodoFooterComponent as child components
    - Clear input/output interfaces for communication

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved
    
    All business logic is preserved and appropriately migrated from React/TypeScript to Angular:
    - Todo CRUD operations
    - Filtering functionality
    - Persistence to localStorage
    - UI interactions and keyboard shortcuts
