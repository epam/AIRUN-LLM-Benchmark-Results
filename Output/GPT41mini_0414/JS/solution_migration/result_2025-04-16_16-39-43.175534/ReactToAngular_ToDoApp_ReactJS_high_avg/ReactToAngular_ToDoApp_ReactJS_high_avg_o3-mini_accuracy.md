# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The provided answer explicitly states the migration to "Angular 14.x" and all Angular-specific implementations (such as Angular Router, Angular Dependency Injection, and Angular CLI module structure) align with this version.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The code includes imports from '@ngrx/store', proper reducer setup via StoreModule.forRoot, and appropriate store selectors, confirming the use of NgRx for state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  The answer implements effects using '@ngrx/effects' (e.g., TodoEffects) and registers them with EffectsModule.forRoot, ensuring side effects are properly handled.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  The provided code defines a comprehensive set of actions, a reducer that responds to those actions, and selectors for accessing state slices. The structure is consistent with NgRx best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  The components clearly utilize @Component for component declarations, @Input for receiving data, and @Output coupled with EventEmitter for event handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  The code replaces React refs with Angular’s @ViewChild (e.g., in TodoAppComponent and TodoItemComponent), effectively handling DOM element references.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  Property communication between components is implemented via @Input() bindings, and events are emitted using @Output() and EventEmitter, as seen in the TodoItemComponent and TodoFooterComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  Angular services (such as TodoService and UtilsService) are defined and injected properly to handle data persistence, utility operations, and business logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  Dependency injection is properly utilized in constructors across components and services, enabling modularity and ease of testing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  Components like TodoAppComponent and TodoItemComponent use ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush, which is a good practice for performance optimization in Angular.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  The AppRoutingModule and feature routing in TodosRoutingModule clearly show the use of Angular Router for navigation and lazy loading.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code structure, naming conventions, use of Angular decorators, and module organization generally adhere to Angular style guide recommendations.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  The answer defines coherent TypeScript interfaces/types (e.g., ITodo, ITodoState, and Filter) that help maintain type safety and enhance code clarity.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  The provided components include Angular HTML templates (instead of JSX), which properly replace React’s templating mechanism with Angular’s binding syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  Interaction events (like keydown, blur, click) are handled using Angular’s event binding syntax (e.g., (keydown)="onNewTodoKeyDown($event)") instead of React event handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  The review of the code shows that there are no remaining "TODO" comments in the production-ready code, aligning with the requirement of being complete.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  The AppRoutingModule demonstrates lazy loading of the TodosModule via loadChildren, fulfilling the requirement for lazy loading.
