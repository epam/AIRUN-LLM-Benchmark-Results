# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The TodoAppComponent template iterates over the list from the NgRx store via the observable (filteredTodos$) and displays each todo via the TodoItemComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  New todos are captured by the onNewTodoKeyDown method in TodoAppComponent, which dispatches the addTodo action when Enter is pressed with non-empty text.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  Both individual toggles (in TodoItemComponent emitting a toggle event) and the “Mark all as complete” checkbox in TodoAppComponent are implemented and dispatch the appropriate actions.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  Although the TodoItemComponent handles editing with its onEdit, onSave, and onCancel methods, the parent TodoAppComponent template refers to an onSave method (i.e. (save)="onSave(todo, $event)") that is not defined. This indicates that the editing save functionality is missing from TodoAppComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent emits a destroy event, and the TodoAppComponent template dispatches the deleteTodo action accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  The onToggleAll method in TodoAppComponent is implemented to dispatch the toggleAll action based on the checkbox state.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  Filtering is appropriately handled by the NgRx selectors and the Angular Router configuration. Although the logic appears correct, the tight coupling of the route snapshot value and the filter value might need additional testing in a dynamic environment.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooterComponent receives an active count via the input property and displays it correctly using the provided template.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The clearCompleted action is dispatched when the clear-completed button is clicked, and the reducer properly filters out completed todos.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  The TodoService uses localStorage for persistence. Additionally, the TodoAppComponent subscribes to todos$ and calls saveTodos. However, the synchronization between NgRx store updates and service persistence is manually handled, which typically works but might not cover all edge cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The routing is designed with routes for '/', '/active', and '/completed', and lazy-loads the TodosModule, thus preserving the expected URL structure.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  The main section is conditionally rendered with an *ngIf on the todos count. While this hides the list when there are no todos, there is no explicit empty-state message. Depending on requirements, this might be acceptable but could also be enhanced.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  The onNewTodoKeyDown method prevents the default event and dispatches an action only when the trimmed value is non-empty.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The component hierarchy (AppComponent, TodoAppComponent, TodoItemComponent, TodoFooterComponent) is well-structured with clear input/output communication. One caveat is the missing onSave method in TodoAppComponent, which affects the editing relationship. Otherwise, components are properly decoupled.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  Most business logic, including adding, toggling, deleting, filtering, and persistence, is present. However, the incomplete implementation of the editing functionality (missing onSave method in TodoAppComponent) indicates that not all business logic from the original application has been fully preserved.
