# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The code clearly specifies Angular 14.x framework usage through the setup instructions: `ng new todomvc-ng --routing=false --style=css` and the import statements, component structure, and usage of Angular decorators which are consistent with Angular 14.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS
  
  The code exclusively uses ES modules with import statements like `import { Component } from '@angular/core';` instead of RequireJS define blocks.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management
  
  The implementation includes proper @ngrx/store setup through the imports in app.module.ts and throughout the application: `import { StoreModule } from '@ngrx/store';` and `StoreModule.forRoot({ todos: todoReducer })`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects
  
  The code includes @ngrx/effects for side effects handling, particularly for localStorage interaction: `import { EffectsModule } from '@ngrx/effects';` and `EffectsModule.forRoot([TodoEffects])`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management
  
  The code includes well-defined actions (src/app/store/actions/todo.actions.ts), reducers (src/app/store/reducers/todo.reducer.ts), selectors (src/app/store/selectors/todo.selectors.ts), and effects (src/app/store/effects/todo.effects.ts) for todo management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator
  
  All services use the @Injectable decorator, e.g., `@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })` in TodoStorageService.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service
  
  The TodoStorageService properly implements localStorage for data persistence with methods like `get()`, `put()`, and `putCurrentState()`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators
  
  All components use proper @Component decorators with selector, templateUrl, and styleUrls properties.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators
  
  The TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective both use proper @Directive decorators.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)
  
  Templates use proper Angular template syntax, e.g., `*ngIf="(todos$ | async)?.length > 0"` and `*ngFor="let todo of todos$ | async"`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))
  
  Event binding follows Angular syntax: `(click)="remove()"`, `(change)="toggleCompleted()"`, and others.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])
  
  Property binding is correctly implemented with syntax like `[class.completed]="todo.completed"` and `[appTodoFocus]="editing"`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed
  
  The code properly implements lifecycle hooks where needed, such as `ngOnInit()` in TodoAppComponent and ngOnChanges in both TodoFocusDirective and TodoListComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models
  
  The code uses TypeScript interfaces for data models: `export interface Todo { id: string; title: string; completed: boolean; }` and `export interface TodoState { todos: Todo[]; }`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services
  
  Dependency injection is properly implemented throughout the application, e.g., `constructor(private store: Store<TodoState>) {}` in components and services.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code adheres to Angular style guide conventions, including naming patterns (e.g., kebab-case for files, PascalCase for class names, camelCase for properties and methods), and appropriate file organization.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings
  
  The code appears to be free of potential console errors or warnings based on the implementation. However, without running the code, I cannot be 100% certain that runtime errors wouldn't occur.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)
  
  TypeScript features are used appropriately throughout the codebase, including interfaces, type annotations, and generics.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code
  
  The code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code segments, and this is specifically mentioned in the migration summary: "No TODOs remain; code is modular, maintainable, and optimized."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design
  
  The application follows single responsibility principle with components divided into logical pieces: TodoAppComponent, TodoHeaderComponent, TodoListComponent, TodoItemComponent, and TodoFooterComponent, each with a specific role.
