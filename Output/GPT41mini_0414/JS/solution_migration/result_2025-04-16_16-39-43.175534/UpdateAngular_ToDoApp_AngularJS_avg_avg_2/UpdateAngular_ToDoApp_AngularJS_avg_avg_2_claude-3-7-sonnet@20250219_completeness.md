- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete

    This is implemented in the `todo-list.component.ts` with the `toggleAll()` method that dispatches the `toggleAll` action.

    The HTML structure matches the TodoMVC pattern, and the code mentions reusing existing CSS from todomvc-common/base.css and todomvc-app-css/index.css. Without seeing the actual rendered UI, I'm 95% confident it maintains the same appearance.
