# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The migration instructions explicitly state “Angular 14 project” and use Angular CLI commands appropriate for Angular 14.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
  The provided migration fully replaces RequireJS with ES modules and Angular CLI build system imports.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
  The code imports and uses @ngrx/store (StoreModule.forRoot, createAction, createReducer, etc.) successfully.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
  The migration code includes @ngrx/effects and registers TodoEffects through EffectsModule.forRoot.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
  Detailed implementations for actions, reducer, selectors, and effects can be observed, covering all required state changes for todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
  The TodoStorageService is decorated with @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }), ensuring its proper injection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
  The TodoStorageService accesses localStorage to retrieve and store todo data.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
  Every component (e.g., todo-app, todo-header, todo-list, todo-item, todo-footer) is correctly annotated with the @Component decorator.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
  Both todo-focus.directive.ts and todo-escape.directive.ts are defined using the @Directive decorator appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
  The templates utilize Angular directives such as *ngFor and *ngIf correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
  Event bindings are correctly implemented, for example, using (click) and (ngSubmit) appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
  The code examples show correct usage of property binding indicators like [class.completed] and [checked].

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
  Key lifecycle hooks such as ngOnInit in components and ngOnChanges in directives are used fittingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
  A Todo interface is declared and used across actions and services as the data model.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
  The use of dependency injection (e.g., injecting Store into components and TodoStorageService) is correctly applied.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code is organized into modules, components, services, and directives, following standard Angular file structure and naming conventions. Minor deviations might exist but none are evident in the migration description.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
  The code appears free of obvious errors; however, as static code analysis cannot guarantee runtime behavior, this is assumed based on the provided implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
  The code employs TypeScript features such as type annotations, interfaces, and ES6+ syntax appropriately throughout.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
  There are no visible TODOs or commented-out code sections in the provided migration code.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design  
  The migration shows a clear separation of concerns. Components, services, directives, and state management are individually responsible for distinct functionalities. This holds true based on the provided structure, though full validation would require a deeper review of runtime behavior.
