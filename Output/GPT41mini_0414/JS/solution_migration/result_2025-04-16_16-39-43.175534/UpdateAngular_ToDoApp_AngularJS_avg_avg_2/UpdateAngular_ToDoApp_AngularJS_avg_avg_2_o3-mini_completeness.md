# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list  
  The solution includes the "todo-list" component (todo-list.component.ts and todo-list.component.html) which handles displaying the list of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos  
  The "todo-header" component is used for adding new todos (todo-header.component.ts and todo-header.component.html).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos  
  The "todo-item" component implements inline editing for todos with appropriate functionality to update or cancel edits.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos  
  Filtering is managed by the "todo-footer" component, where the user can click on links to select filters (all, active, completed).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics  
  The "todo-footer" component displays the count of remaining todos using the remainingCount$ observable.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos  
  The "todo-header" component validates input and dispatches an addTodo action to the store when a new todo is added.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos  
  The "todo-item" component allows toggling into an editing mode, updating the todo title via the updateTodo action when changes are made.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos  
  The "todo-item" component includes a remove() method that dispatches the deleteTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed  
  The "todo-item" component toggles a todoâ€™s completion status by dispatching the toggleTodo action, and the "todo-list" component supports bulk updates via toggleAll.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)  
  The "todo-footer" component provides clickable links for filtering, and the "todo-list" component uses selector functions (e.g., selectFilteredTodos) to show the filtered results.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete  
  The "todo-list" component features a checkbox for marking all todos as complete or incomplete via the toggleAll action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos  
  The "todo-footer" component includes a button that dispatches the clearCompleted action to remove all completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos  
  The remaining todo count is derived from the selector "selectRemainingCount" and is displayed in the "todo-footer" component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage  
  The TodoStorageService handles saving the current state of todos to localStorage using methods such as put() and putCurrentState().

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization  
  The TodoEffects loadTodos$ effect reads todos from localStorage through TodoStorageService.get() during app initialization.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing  
  The appTodoEscape directive listens for the Escape key event, and in the "todo-item" component, this event triggers cancelEditing().

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo  
  The appTodoFocus directive is used in the "todo-item" component to focus the input field when a todo enters editing mode.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original  
  The solution suggests reusing the original CSS files (from todomvc-common/base.css and todomvc-app-css/index.css) by integrating them into the Angular project. However, since the exact visual output is dependent on how these styles are applied, there is a slight uncertainty.
  
  Explanation: The answer relies on the instruction to reuse the existing CSS but does not show direct integration; therefore, while the approach is correct, we are 90% confident that the visual appearance matches the original.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately  
  In both the "todo-header" and "todo-item" components, empty or whitespace-only titles are handled appropriately by either not dispatching add actions or by removing the todo if an edit results in an empty title.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter  
  Although the "todo-footer" component displays anchor links with href attributes like "#/active" and similar, the (click) handlers prevent the default behavior (using $event.preventDefault()), meaning that the URL is not actually updated when the filter is changed. The functionality required to update the URL based on the selected filter is therefore not fully implemented.
