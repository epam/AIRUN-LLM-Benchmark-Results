# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all React imports use React 18.x compatible syntax
  
  All React imports use React 18.x syntax. The code uses `createRoot` from `react-dom/client` in the entry point, which is the React 18.x way of rendering applications.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all components use functional component syntax with hooks instead of class components
  
  All components (`TodoApp`, `TodoList`, `TodoItem`, and `TodoFooter`) are implemented as functional components using hooks like `useEffect`, `useState`, `useRef`, `useCallback`, and `useMemo`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Redux Toolkit's createSlice is used for state management
  
  The code uses Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` in the `todosSlice.ts` file for state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for all props, state, and Redux store
  
  TypeScript interfaces are properly defined, including `Todo`, `Filter`, `TodosState`, `TodoListProps`, `TodoItemProps`, and `TodoFooterProps`. The Redux store types are also properly defined with `RootState` and `AppDispatch`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses immutable state updates in reducers
  
  Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` is used, which internally uses Immer to provide immutable state updates while allowing "mutable" syntax in reducers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that nanoid is used for ID generation instead of custom UUID implementation
  
  The code imports and uses `nanoid` for ID generation in the `prepare` function of the `addTodo` reducer.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application uses React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate
  
  `React.memo` is applied to all components: `TodoApp`, `TodoList`, `TodoItem`, and `TodoFooter`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that useCallback is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  
  `useCallback` is consistently used for all event handlers throughout the application, including `handleNewTodoKeyDown`, `handleToggleAll`, `handleToggle`, `handleDestroy`, `handleEdit`, `handleChange`, `handleSubmit`, `handleKeyDown`, `handleBlur`, and `handleClearCompleted`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage handling is implemented in a modern way
  
  The code uses modern localStorage handling with try/catch blocks and proper JSON parsing/stringifying in the `loadTodos` and `saveTodos` functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows consistent naming conventions throughout the application
  
  The code follows consistent camelCase naming conventions for variables and functions throughout the entire application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper error handling is implemented where necessary
  
  The code includes error handling for localStorage operations and JSON parsing with try/catch blocks.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware
  
  Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware using `configureStore` and customizing the middleware with `getDefaultMiddleware`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React.lazy is used for code splitting where appropriate
  
  `React.lazy` is used for code splitting the `TodoApp` component in the entry point file.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the codebase has no TODOs remaining
  
  There are no TODOs remaining in the codebase.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux Provider wraps the application entry point
  
  The Redux `Provider` component correctly wraps the application in the entry point.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure strict TypeScript type checking is implemented throughout the application
  
  Strict TypeScript type checking is implemented throughout the application with proper interfaces, type annotations, and generic types.
