# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all React imports use React 18.x compatible syntax  
  The code imports ReactDOM from "react-dom/client" and uses the new createRoot API, which is compatible with React 18.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all components use functional component syntax with hooks instead of class components  
  All components (e.g., TodoApp, TodoList, TodoItem, and TodoFooter) are implemented as functional components using hooks.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Redux Toolkit's createSlice is used for state management  
  The state management is handled with Redux Toolkit’s createSlice (in todosSlice.ts), ensuring standardized Redux patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for all props, state, and Redux store  
  Interfaces and type annotations are used extensively in the code (for props in components, the Redux store types, and slice state), demonstrating strict TypeScript typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses immutable state updates in reducers  
  Although mutations are used in the reducers, Redux Toolkit’s createSlice leverages Immer under the hood to maintain immutability, thus fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that nanoid is used for ID generation instead of custom UUID implementation  
  The code uses nanoid in the prepare callback of addTodo, ensuring efficient and modern ID generation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application uses React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate  
  Components such as TodoApp, TodoList, TodoItem, and TodoFooter are wrapped in React.memo to reduce unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that useCallback is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders  
  The code makes extensive use of useCallback for event handlers (e.g., in TodoApp and TodoItem), ensuring stable references and optimized re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage handling is implemented in a modern way  
  The implementation uses try/catch blocks for both reading (JSON.parse) and writing (JSON.stringify) from/to localStorage, handling errors gracefully.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code follows consistent naming conventions throughout the application  
  Consistent camelCase naming is maintained for variables, functions, and file names throughout the codebase.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper error handling is implemented where necessary  
  Error handling is provided in the localStorage functions via try/catch, which is appropriate for the given context.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware  
  The store is configured using configureStore with a customized middleware that disables serializableCheck when needed, meeting the configuration requirements.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React.lazy is used for code splitting where appropriate  
  The TodoApp component is lazy loaded in the index.tsx file using React.lazy (with Suspense) for efficient code splitting.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the codebase has no TODOs remaining  
  A review of the code shows that there are no leftover TODO comments in the codebase.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux Provider wraps the application entry point  
  In index.tsx, the Redux Provider correctly wraps the application, ensuring proper state management throughout the app.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure strict TypeScript type checking is implemented throughout the application  
  The application makes comprehensive use of TypeScript with strict type annotations across components, slices, hooks, and utilities.
