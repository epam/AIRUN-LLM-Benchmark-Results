# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The "new-todo" input in TodoApp.tsx uses an onKeyDown handler that checks for "Enter". Pressing Enter triggers the dispatch of addTodo, ensuring that a new todo is created.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The TodoList.tsx component uses a useMemo hook to filter todos based on the current filter value (all, active, completed), and then maps through the filtered list to render each TodoItem.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  The main app includes a checkbox (with id "toggle-all") with an onChange event that dispatches the toggleAll action from todosSlice, correctly toggling the completion status for all todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  In TodoItem.tsx, all three functionalities are present:  
  • Toggling via an input checkbox that calls the toggle action.  
  • Editing mode is enabled via double-clicking the label (calling startEditing).  
  • Deletion is implemented by a button that dispatches the destroy action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  The label in TodoItem.tsx has an onDoubleClick handler that dispatches startEditing, which correctly enables the editing mode for the specific todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  Within the TodoItem.tsx component, in the onKeyDown handler for the edit input, pressing "Enter" calls handleSubmit, which either saves the modified todo or deletes it if the title is empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  The onKeyDown handler in TodoItem.tsx checks for the "Escape" key; it resets the local editText state to the original todo title and dispatches cancelEditing to exit the editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooter.tsx component displays a count of active todos (items not completed) by rendering the activeTodoCount passed from TodoApp.tsx.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  TodoFooter.tsx renders filter links ("All", "Active", "Completed") that allow the user to change the current filter by dispatching the setFilter action, while also updating the URL accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  In TodoFooter.tsx, if there are completed todos (completedCount > 0), a "Clear completed" button is rendered, which dispatches the clearCompleted action when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  The todosSlice.ts file integrates persistence by loading initial todos from localStorage (using loadTodos) and saving updated todos (via saveTodos) after each modifying action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  In TodoApp.tsx, rendering of the main Todos section and the footer is done conditionally based on whether there are todos present and/or active/completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  The TodoFooter.tsx component utilizes the pluralize utility (from utils.ts) to correctly display "item" or "items" based on the active todo count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The code structure breaks down the application into focused components (TodoApp, TodoList, TodoItem, TodoFooter), each handling a specific responsibility with clear separation of concerns.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The project structure is well-organized with a features folder containing all todo-related components and slices, along with separate files for constants, utilities, hooks, and the Redux store.
