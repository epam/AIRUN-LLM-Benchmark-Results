# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration
  
  The code clearly specifies using Create React App with TypeScript template:
  ```bash
  npx create-react-app virtual-piano --template typescript
  ```
  And React 18 is evident from the usage of `ReactDOM.createRoot` in `src/index.tsx`, which is specific to React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure
  
  TypeScript interfaces are properly defined, including:
  ```typescript
  interface SoundMapper {
    [note: string]: HTMLAudioElement;
  }
  
  interface PianoKeyProps {
    note?: Note;
    letter?: string;
    isSharp?: boolean;
    isActive: boolean;
    onPlay: (note: Note, letter: string) => void;
    onStop: (note: Note, letter: string) => void;
    none?: boolean;
    showLetters: boolean;
  }
  ```
  Also, there's a Type definition for Note: `type Note = 'c' | 'd' | 'e' | 'f' | 'g' | 'a' | 'b' | 'c♯' | 'd♯' | 'f♯' | 'g♯' | 'a♯';`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks
  
  Both components (`App` and `PianoKey`) are implemented as functional components with proper React hook usage:
  ```typescript
  const PianoKey: React.FC<PianoKeyProps> = memo(({ ... }) => { ... });
  
  const App: React.FC = () => { 
    // hooks used: useState, useEffect, useCallback, useRef
    ...
  };
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)
  
  The code demonstrates proper state management with hooks:
  ```typescript
  const [activeNotes, setActiveNotes] = useState<Set<Note>>(new Set());
  const [showLetters, setShowLetters] = useState(false);
  ```
  And `useEffect` for lifecycle management and side effects like initializing audio elements and attaching event listeners.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels
  
  Keyboard events are properly implemented at document level with `useEffect` and `useCallback`:
  ```typescript
  useEffect(() => {
    document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
    document.addEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp);
    
    return () => {
      document.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
      document.removeEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp);
    };
  }, [handleKeyDown, handleKeyUp]);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events
  
  Mouse events are implemented properly using React synthetic events in the `PianoKey` component:
  ```typescript
  onMouseDown={handleMouseDown}
  onMouseUp={handleMouseUp}
  onMouseOut={handleMouseOut}
  onMouseMove={handleMouseMove}
  ```
  Each with properly typed event handlers:
  ```typescript
  const handleMouseDown = (e: MouseEvent<HTMLDivElement>) => { ... }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment
  
  Audio resources are correctly initialized with proper paths relative to public folder:
  ```typescript
  const sounds: SoundMapper = {
    c: new Audio('/assets/audio/a.mp3'),
    d: new Audio('/assets/audio/d.mp3'),
    // ...
  };
  ```
  With preloading and proper cleanup:
  ```typescript
  // Preload audio
  Object.values(sounds).forEach((audio) => {
    audio.load();
  });
  
  // Cleanup on unmount
  return () => {
    Object.values(sounds).forEach((audio) => {
      audio.pause();
      audio.currentTime = 0;
    });
  };
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility
  
  Fullscreen functionality is implemented with proper browser compatibility:
  ```typescript
  const toggleFullscreen = () => {
    if (!document.fullscreenElement) {
      const docEl = document.documentElement;
      if (docEl.requestFullscreen) {
        docEl.requestFullscreen();
      } else if ((docEl as any).webkitRequestFullscreen) {
        // Safari
        (docEl as any).webkitRequestFullscreen();
      } else if ((docEl as any).msRequestFullscreen) {
        // IE11
        (docEl as any).msRequestFullscreen();
      }
    } else {
      // Exit fullscreen with similar browser compatibility
      ...
    }
  };
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns
  
  Classes are conditionally applied using React patterns:
  ```typescript
  const classNames = ['piano-key'];
  if (isSharp) classNames.push('sharp');
  if (none) classNames.push('none');
  if (isActive) classNames.push('piano-key-active');
  
  // Then applied:
  className={classNames.join(' ')}
  ```
  
  And in the `piano` component:
  ```typescript
  <div className={`piano ${showLetters ? 'letters' : ''}`}>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate
  
  The `PianoKey` component is memoized for performance:
  ```typescript
  const PianoKey: React.FC<PianoKeyProps> = memo(({ ... }) => { ... });
  ```
  With a proper display name set:
  ```typescript
  PianoKey.displayName = 'PianoKey';
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations
  
  Audio playback is properly managed with React lifecycle considerations:
  1. Audio elements are initialized once using `useEffect`
  2. Audio resources are stored in a `useRef` to persist across renders
  3. Playing and stopping notes are implemented with `useCallback` for stable references
  4. Proper cleanup on component unmount is implemented

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application
  
  The code demonstrates consistent TypeScript typing throughout:
  - Defined types for notes: `type Note = ...`
  - Interfaces for props and data structures
  - Properly typed event handlers
  - Properly typed state: `useState<Set<Note>>(new Set())`
  - Type assertions when needed: `(docEl as any).webkitRequestFullscreen()`
  - Proper typing of React components: `React.FC<PianoKeyProps>`
