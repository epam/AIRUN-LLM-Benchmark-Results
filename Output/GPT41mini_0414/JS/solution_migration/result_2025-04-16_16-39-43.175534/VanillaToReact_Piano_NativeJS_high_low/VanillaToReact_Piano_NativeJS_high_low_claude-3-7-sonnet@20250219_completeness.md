# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'
  
  The code includes a header element with the class "header" containing an h1 element with the class "header-title" and the text "Virtual Piano".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons
  
  The code includes a div with class "btn-container" containing two buttons: one with class "btn btn-notes" for "Notes" and another with class "btn btn-letters" for "Letters".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)
  
  The code renders all piano keys by mapping through the pianoKeysData array for natural keys (c, d, e, f, g, a, b) and the sharpKeysData array for sharp keys (c♯, d♯, f♯, g♯, a♯), including an empty space where no sharp key exists between e and f.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes
  
  Each piano key div includes data-letter and data-note attributes that are set based on the corresponding letter and note values from the data arrays.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked
  
  The application creates Audio objects for each note in the useEffect hook and plays them when keys are clicked via the playNote function, which is called in the handleMouseDown event handler of the PianoKey component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)
  
  Active keys are tracked in the activeNotes state, and when a key is active, the "piano-key-active" class is added to its className.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes
  
  The application has keyboard event listeners (handleKeyDown and handleKeyUp) that check for key presses corresponding to piano keys and trigger the playNote and stopNote functions accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked
  
  The application maintains a showLetters state variable that controls whether letters or notes are displayed. This state is toggled by the handleToggle function when the "Notes" or "Letters" buttons are clicked, and the appropriate content is displayed in each PianoKey component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes
  
  The application includes a fullscreen button that calls the toggleFullscreen function when clicked. This function uses standard and vendor-prefixed fullscreen APIs to toggle fullscreen mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly
  
  The application uses a Set to track active notes (activeNotes) and a ref (playedNotes) to prevent repeated note playing, allowing for multiple simultaneous key presses.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys
  
  The PianoKey component includes a handleMouseMove event handler that checks if the mouse button is pressed (e.buttons === 1) and triggers the playNote function, enabling drag-to-play functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information
  
  The application includes a footer element with class "footer" containing a div with class "footer-container" and the text "2020".
