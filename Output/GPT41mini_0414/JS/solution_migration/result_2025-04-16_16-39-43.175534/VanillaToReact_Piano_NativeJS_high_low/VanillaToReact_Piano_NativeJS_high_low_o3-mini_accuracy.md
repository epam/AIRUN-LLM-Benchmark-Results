# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration  
  The answer clearly mentions "React 18 + TypeScript migration" and demonstrates the usage of ReactDOM’s createRoot, which is part of React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure  
  The use of the interface SoundMapper confirms that TypeScript interfaces are applied for mapping audio elements.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks  
  All components are defined as functional components (using React.FC) and make extensive use of hooks such as useEffect, useState, useRef, and useCallback.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)  
  The application effectively uses useState for managing active notes and toggle state, as well as useEffect for audio initialization and cleanup.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels  
  Keyboard event handlers are correctly attached at the document level within a useEffect, ensuring global key press detection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events  
  The PianoKey component handles mouse events (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) via React’s synthetic event system.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment  
  Audio elements are instantiated within a useEffect hook, preloaded, and stored in a useRef for persistence across renders, with cleanup on unmount.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility  
  Fullscreen toggling is implemented with standard and vendor-prefixed APIs and is appropriately triggered by a button within the React component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns  
  The PianoKey component builds its className list based on multiple conditions (isSharp, none, isActive), using an array and joining it.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate  
  The PianoKey component is wrapped with React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders, demonstrating a performance optimization.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations  
  Audio elements are managed within the component’s lifecycle (initialized in useEffect and cleaned up on unmount), supporting proper playback control.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application  
  The code utilizes TypeScript features with explicit type definitions (interfaces, types for props and state), ensuring strict type safety.
