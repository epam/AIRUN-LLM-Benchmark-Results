# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'  
  The provided code contains a header element with a h1 that displays "Virtual Piano".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons  
  A div with class "btn-container" is implemented and includes two buttons labeled "Notes" and "Letters" with proper active state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)  
  The code maps over the pianoKeysData array for natural keys and over the sharpKeysData array for sharp keys, ensuring all expected keys are rendered.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes  
  Each PianoKey component is rendered with data-letter and data-note attributes, which satisfy this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked  
  The playNote function fetches the correct HTMLAudioElement for each note from the soundMapper and plays it on interaction, fulfilling this requirement.  
  Note: There is a noted inconsistency where both 'c' and 'a' keys map to "a.mp3", but the explanation clarifies this was preserved from the original code, and thus it meets the intended implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)  
  The state management using activeNotes and className modifications (adding "piano-key-active") ensure that keys are visually highlighted when active.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes  
  Keyboard event listeners are attached to the document for keydown and keyup events, and they correctly map key presses to the corresponding notes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked  
  Toggling is managed via the showLetters state, and the display of PianoKey components adapts based on that state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes  
  The toggleFullscreen function implements standard and vendor-prefixed fullscreen API calls to switch modes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly  
  The use of a Set (playedNotes) prevents repeated triggering of the same note and allows multiple keys to be handled simultaneously.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys  
  The onMouseMove event in each PianoKey checks if the mouse button is pressed (via e.buttons) to trigger note play, which supports drag functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information  
  The footer element is present and contains the year "2020" as specified.
