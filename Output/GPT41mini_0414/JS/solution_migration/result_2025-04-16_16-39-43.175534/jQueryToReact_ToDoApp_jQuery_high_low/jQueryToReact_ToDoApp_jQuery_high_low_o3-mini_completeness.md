# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos  
  The code in src/features/todos/TodosApp.tsx clearly defines a header element with an h1 element that displays "todos" and an input field (id="new-todo") for entering new todo items.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos  
  The main section in TodosApp.tsx contains a "toggle-all" checkbox and renders the <TodoList /> component, which displays the list of todo items.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button  
  In TodoItem.tsx, each todo item is rendered with an input checkbox (class "toggle"), a label showing the todo title, and a button (class "destroy") for deletion.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode  
  The label in TodoItem.tsx has an onDoubleClick handler that sets the editing state, which triggers the rendering of an input field for editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The App.tsx and TodoFooter.tsx implement filtering through React Router and Redux state management based on filters "all," "active," and "completed".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization  
  The TodoFooter.tsx calculates the active count and displays it with the appropriate singular ("item") or plural ("items") label.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter  
  Filter links in TodoFooter.tsx use conditional classes to render the current selected filter with a "selected" class.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist  
  The footer conditionally renders a "Clear completed" button if there are completed todos, as seen in TodoFooter.tsx.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter  
  The input field in TodosApp.tsx handles the "Enter" key event to add new todos via the addTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos  
  In TodoItem.tsx, checking or unchecking the toggle checkbox dispatches the toggleTodo action to update the todoâ€™s completion status.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once  
  The "toggle-all" checkbox in TodosApp.tsx, when changed, triggers the toggleAll action to update all todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management  
  The TodoItem.tsx editing functionality uses a useEffect hook to focus the edit input and position the cursor at the end, ensuring proper focus management.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos  
  The delete button in each todo item (in TodoItem.tsx) dispatches the deleteTodo action to remove that todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos  
  The "Clear completed" button in TodoFooter.tsx dispatches the clearCompleted action to remove all completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status  
  The selectFilteredTodos function in TodoList.tsx correctly filters the todos according to the selected filter state.
