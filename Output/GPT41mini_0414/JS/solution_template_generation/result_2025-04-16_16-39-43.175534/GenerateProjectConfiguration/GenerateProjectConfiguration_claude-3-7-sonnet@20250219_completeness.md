    The project includes all the required technologies:
    - Vite: configured in vite.config.ts and as a dependency in package.json
    - TypeScript: configured in tsconfig.json and as a dependency in package.json
    - React: included as a dependency with react and react-dom
    - Redux: implemented via @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux
    - React Router: implemented via react-router-dom

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm documentation includes all available CLI commands with explanations for each command's purpose

    - npm run dev
    - npm run build
    - npm run preview
    - npm run test
    - npm run test:coverage
    - npm run lint

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that package.json includes all necessary dependencies for the required technologies
    
    The package.json file includes all required dependencies:
    - "@reduxjs/toolkit": for Redux state management
    - "react" and "react-dom": for React
    - "react-redux": for Redux with React
    - "react-router-dom": for routing
    - "vite" and TypeScript-related dependencies for the build system

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the project contains complete configuration files without placeholder comments or TODOs
    
    All configuration files are complete and don't contain placeholder comments or TODOs:
    - package.json
    - vite.config.ts
    - tsconfig.json
    - tsconfig.node.json

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the presence of proper TypeScript type definitions throughout the project
    
    The code consistently uses TypeScript types throughout:
    - React components are typed with React.FC
    - Redux state interfaces (CounterState)
    - Action types (PayloadAction<number>)
    - Store types (RootState, AppDispatch)
    - Type assertions (document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure testing library configuration is complete with necessary setup files
    
    Testing configuration is complete:
    - vite.config.ts includes test configuration for vitest
    - setupTests.ts imports the necessary Testing Library setup
    - All the required testing packages are in devDependencies
    - A sample test file (App.test.tsx) demonstrates proper test configuration

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the project structure includes directories for components, state management, and routing
    
    The project structure is properly organized:
    - State management: src/store directory with slices subdirectory
    - Routing: implemented in App.tsx with Routes and Route components
    - Pages: src/pages directory containing route components (Home.tsx, About.tsx)
    - Tests: src/__tests__ directory

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the entry point files for the application are properly defined
    
    The entry points are properly defined:
    - main.tsx serves as the application entry point
    - App.tsx defines the main application component with routing
    - store/index.ts configures the Redux store

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all configuration follows established best practices for each technology
    
    The configurations follow established best practices:
    - Redux: Using Redux Toolkit with slices and proper typing
    - React Router: Using the latest Router API with proper route configuration
    - TypeScript: Strict mode enabled with appropriate compiler options
    - Testing: Using React Testing Library with proper setup
    - Vite: Properly configured with React plugin

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that build and environment configuration supports production deployment
    
    The build configuration supports production deployment:
    - vite.config.ts configured for both development and production
    - package.json has proper build scripts
    - TypeScript configuration optimized for production builds
    - Coverage reporting configured for test runs
