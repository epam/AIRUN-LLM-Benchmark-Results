# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up in the test file
  
  The test file properly imports and sets up Jest and React Testing Library with necessary imports:
  ```tsx
  import React from 'react';
  import { render, screen, fireEvent, act, within } from '@testing-library/react';
  import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test cases are properly isolated and do not have interdependencies
  
  The test cases use `beforeEach(() => { jest.clearAllMocks(); })` to clear mocks between tests, and each test uses its own render call with specific props for isolation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that DOM events are simulated using proper React Testing Library methods
  
  The test file correctly uses `fireEvent`, `userEvent`, and event objects for simulating interactions:
  ```tsx
  fireEvent.mouseDown(dropdown, { button: 0 });
  await user.type(input, 'abc');
  fireEvent.keyDown(container, { key: 'ArrowDown' });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that accessibility attributes are being tested appropriately
  
  Accessibility testing is thorough with verification of ARIA attributes:
  ```tsx
  test('input has role combobox and aria attributes', () => {
    render(<Select {...baseProps} menuIsOpen />);
    const input = screen.getByTestId('input');
    expect(input).toHaveAttribute('role', 'combobox');
    expect(input).toHaveAttribute('aria-expanded', 'true');
    expect(input).toHaveAttribute('aria-haspopup', 'true');
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure mocks are used for external dependencies where appropriate
  
  The test file uses mocks for all external dependencies and components:
  ```tsx
  jest.mock('./components/Menu', () => ({
    MenuPlacer: ({ children }: any) => <div data-testid="menu-placer">{children({ ref: jest.fn(), placerProps: { placement: 'bottom', maxHeight: 300 } })}</div>,
  }));
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of async/await for asynchronous testing where needed
  
  Asynchronous tests correctly use async/await syntax:
  ```tsx
  test('opens menu on input focus if openMenuOnFocus is true', async () => {
    const user = userEvent.setup();
    render(<Select {...baseProps} openMenuOnFocus menuIsOpen={false} />);
    const input = screen.getByTestId('input');
    await user.focus(input);
    expect(baseProps.onMenuOpen).toHaveBeenCalled();
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all assertions use appropriate Jest matchers
  
  The test file uses appropriate Jest matchers like `toBeInTheDocument()`, `toHaveAttribute()`, `toHaveBeenCalled()`, and `toHaveTextContent()`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that tests include proper cleanup after each test case
  
  The tests use `beforeEach(() => { jest.clearAllMocks(); })` to reset mocks before each test, and rely on React Testing Library's automatic cleanup.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test descriptions clearly indicate what functionality is being tested
  
  Each test has a clear, descriptive name indicating the functionality being tested:
  ```tsx
  test('renders placeholder when no value and controlShouldRenderValue is true', () => {
  test('keyboard navigation: arrow down opens menu and focuses first option', () => {
  test('disabled options are not selectable', () => {
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the test file follows best practices for organizing test cases (describe/it blocks)
  
  Tests are well-organized in nested `describe` blocks by functional area:
  ```tsx
  describe('Select Component', () => {
    describe('Rendering', () => {
    describe('User Interactions', () => {
    describe('State Management', () => {
    // ...
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that all event handlers are tested using appropriate simulation methods
  
  The test file tests all relevant event handlers with appropriate simulation methods:
  ```tsx
  test('calls onInputChange on typing', async () => {
  test('mouse click on dropdown indicator toggles menu', () => {
  test('clearValue clears all values', () => {
  ```

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the test environment correctly simulates both mouse and keyboard interactions
  
  The test file simulates mouse and keyboard interactions properly, but has a minor limitation in simulating internal state changes after keyboard navigation:
  ```tsx
  act(() => {
    // We simulate internal state by opening menu and focusing option
    // This is a limitation; ideally, test internal state or expose methods
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for touch events properly simulate mobile interactions
  
  Touch events are properly simulated with the correct event structure:
  ```tsx
  fireEvent.touchStart(container, { touches: [{ clientX: 0, clientY: 0 }] });
  fireEvent.touchMove(container, { touches: [{ clientX: 10, clientY: 10 }] });
  fireEvent.touchEnd(container);
  ```
