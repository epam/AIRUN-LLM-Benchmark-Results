# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present
- **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented
- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested
- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance
- **Pass** (90%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested

    The answer includes tests for focus behavior using `input.focus()` and checking input focus with `toHaveFocus()`, but there are some limitations noted by the author around testing internal focus state. The test suite mentions "focusInput and blurInput" tests but acknowledges challenges in accessing instance methods via refs. A more comprehensive approach to different focus scenarios would improve this area.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering
- **Fail** (80%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations

    The answer does not explicitly include tests for custom `formatOptionLabel` implementations. While the test suite is comprehensive in testing value rendering, it doesn't specifically test scenarios where custom formatting is applied to option labels or selected values. This is an important customization feature of the Select component that should be tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)
- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)
