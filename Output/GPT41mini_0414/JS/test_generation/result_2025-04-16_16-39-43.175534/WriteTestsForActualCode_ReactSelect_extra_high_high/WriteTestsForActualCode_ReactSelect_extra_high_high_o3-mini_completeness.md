# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist  
   The test suite includes a "Rendering" section with multiple tests (e.g., rendering of the select container, control, and input) to ensure the component renders with default props.

2. **Fail** (95%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present  
   While the tests include keyboard navigation with arrow keys, tab, and enter (e.g., "keyboard navigation: arrow down opens menu and focuses first option" and using Enter in multi-select), there is no explicit test for the Escape key. This reduces the coverage for complete keyboard navigation testing.

3. **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)  
   The suite has tests for mouse clicks on interactive elements (dropdown indicator, clear indicator) and a test for hovering (on options) to check internal behavior without errors.

4. **Fail** (90%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior  
   The tests verify controlled behavior (e.g., "controlled value updates selectValue state") but do not explicitly cover uncontrolled behavior. There is no dedicated test simulating an uncontrolled usage scenario.

5. **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values  
   Tests exist for selecting options in multi-select mode, removing a selected value ("removeValue removes selected value"), and clearing all values ("clearValue clears all values").

6. **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented  
   The suite includes tests such as "menu opens and closes correctly" which check the proper calling of onMenuOpen and onMenuClose callbacks.

7. **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality  
   The test "filters options based on inputValue" confirms that options are filtered based on the input string.

8. **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist  
   Multiple tests cover multi-select scenarios, including rendering multi-value selections and testing selection/deselection actions.

9. **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility  
   There are tests for ARIA attributes such as "applies aria attributes correctly" and "input has role combobox and aria attributes", ensuring accessibility compliance.

10. **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested  
    The test "renders no options message when options empty" confirms that an empty options array is handled gracefully.

11. **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states  
    While the test "renders loading message when isLoading is true" covers the loading state, there is no test case addressing error states.

12. **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states  
    Tests such as "disabled options are not selectable" and "disabled select does not respond to input" confirm that disabled states are handled appropriately.

13. **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance  
    The "renders large option set without crashing" test verifies that the component can handle a large number of options without performance issues.

14. **Pass** (90%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested  
    There is a test for focus management ("focusInput and blurInput focus and blur input element"). Although the test covers basic focus behavior, more in-depth focus state transitions could further enhance this area.

15. **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering  
    Tests check that the placeholder renders when no value is set and that the component displays the correct single or multi-selected values.

16. **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations  
    There are no tests checking custom implementations of formatOptionLabel. This functionality is not covered in the provided test suite.

17. **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)  
    The tests call and validate callback functions such as onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, and onMenuClose, ensuring they behave as expected.

18. **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)  
    The test suite includes interactions with indicator components, such as clicking the dropdown indicator, clear indicator, and verifying the loading indicator.
