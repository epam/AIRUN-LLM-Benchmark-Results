# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)
  
  The test suite clearly uses Jasmine as the testing framework and Karma as the test runner, which are both modern and appropriate choices for AngularJS applications. This is evident from the syntax (`describe`, `it`, `beforeEach`, etc.) and the included Karma configuration file.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints
  
  The tests properly mock the $resource-based REST services using `jasmine.createSpyObj()` to create spy objects with methods like 'save', 'update', 'delete', and 'query'. The REST factory tests also verify that all REST resources are defined with the correct URLs and methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation
  
  The test suite makes extensive use of `beforeEach` hooks to set up the test environment, including module initialization, dependency injection, and test-specific setup. For example, before each controller test, the scope is reset, localStorage is cleared, and mocks are configured.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls
  
  HTTP requests are properly mocked using AngularJS's `$httpBackend` service. For example, in the REST factory tests, there are explicit mock expectations for GET and PUT requests:
  ```javascript
  $httpBackend.expectGET('api/content/123').respond(200, {id: 123, title: 'Test'});
  ```
  The controller tests also mock the REST service methods to prevent real API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection
  
  The tests correctly use AngularJS's dependency injection system. Services are injected in the `beforeEach` blocks using the underscore notation (e.g., `_REST_`) and then assigned to local variables. The controller is initialized with all required dependencies:
  ```javascript
  $controller('pageCtrl', {
    $scope: $scope,
    REST: REST,
    $location: $location,
    Page: Page,
    $rootScope: $rootScope,
    $routeParams: $routeParams,
    $upload: {}, // not used in tests
    Users: Users,
    $translate: $translate
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations
  
  The tests handle asynchronous operations correctly by:
  1. Using `$httpBackend.flush()` after setting expectations
  2. Mocking promise-based APIs like `$translate` with spies that return appropriate promises
  3. Using `$rootScope.$apply()` or `$rootScope.$digest()` to resolve promises in tests
  4. Using `$q.defer()` to create promises that can be resolved/rejected manually in tests

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies
  
  The test suite makes extensive use of Jasmine spies to mock and verify interactions with dependencies:
  - REST methods are mocked with `jasmine.createSpyObj()`
  - `$location.path` is spied on with `spyOn($location, 'path').and.returnValue('/new')`
  - `$translate` methods are mocked with custom implementations
  - `$rootScope.$broadcast` is spied on to verify notification events

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization
  
  The tests follow a clear hierarchical structure using `describe` blocks for grouping related tests and `it` blocks for individual test cases. For example:
  ```javascript
  describe('cosmo AngularJS Application', function() {
    describe('REST Factory', function() {
      // REST tests
    });
    
    describe('Page Factory', function() {
      // Page tests
    });
    
    describe('pageCtrl Controller', function() {
      describe('Initialization', function() {
        // Initialization tests
      });
      
      describe('savePage()', function() {
        // savePage tests
      });
    });
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls
  
  The tests comprehensively cover both success and error scenarios. For example, in the `savePage()` tests:
  - Success cases: successfully saving new pages and updating existing pages
  - Error cases: duplicate URLs, missing page type, empty URL, error responses from the API
  
  Each REST call has tests for successful responses and error handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate
  
  The tests simulate user interactions by calling the appropriate controller methods with the expected arguments, such as:
  - `$scope.titleChange()` to simulate a user changing the title
  - `$scope.selectSuggestion('bar')` to simulate a user selecting an autocomplete suggestion
  - `$scope.deletePage()` to simulate a user deleting a page
  - `$scope.savePage(false)` to simulate a user saving a page

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage
  
  The tests ensure clean state by:
  1. Using `beforeEach` to reset the environment for each test
  2. Explicitly clearing localStorage before tests: `localStorage.clear()`
  3. Creating new scope instances for each test: `$scope = $rootScope.$new()`
  4. Mocking dependencies rather than modifying global state

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested
  
  The test descriptions are clear and descriptive, explaining exactly what is being tested:
  - `'should initialize $scope.page with Page properties'`
  - `'should update Page.title and auto-generate URL if applicable'`
  - `'should handle error on save'`
  - `'should query REST.contentTags with last tag and set suggestions on success'`

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible
  
  The tests appropriately focus on validating function outputs and behavior rather than implementation details:
  - Tests verify the expected changes to the model: `expect(Page.title).toBe('My New Title')`
  - Tests validate that the correct REST methods are called with the right parameters
  - Tests verify that notifications are broadcast with the right messages
  - Tests check that the expected localStorage updates happen
