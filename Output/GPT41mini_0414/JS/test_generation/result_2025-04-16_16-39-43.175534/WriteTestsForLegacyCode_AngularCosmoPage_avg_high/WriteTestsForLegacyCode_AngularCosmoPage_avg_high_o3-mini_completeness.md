# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources  
  The tests for the REST factory explicitly check for the existence of numerous REST resources and verify HTTP methods (e.g., PUT for updates), ensuring that all defined resources are covered.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly  
  The Page factory tests assert default values for all required properties such as id, title, description, header, subheader, and others, confirming proper initialization.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly  
  The Users factory tests check that each property (id, username, name, bio, email, etc.) is initialized as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods  
  The test suite covers a wide range of controller methods (e.g., initialization logic, localVersion, deleteNewerVersion, deletePage, titleChange, descriptionChange, urlChange, saveLocal, autocompleteTags, selectSuggestion, and savePage) indicating a thorough test coverage of public methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller  
  Multiple tests confirm the proper initialization of $scope.page, correct handling of route parameters, and default value assignments including logic for setting newerVersion when localStorage contains newer data.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation  
  The tests for titleChange validate that when a new title is set with autoURL enabled, the URL is correctly auto-generated from the title; they also cover cases where autoURL is false.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction  
  The saveLocal tests check that Page properties are updated as expected and that corresponding keys in localStorage are correctly set.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality  
  The tests for autocompleteTags verify that the REST.contentTags.query function is called with the last tag, and they handle both successful tag suggestion responses and error or empty cases appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)  
  The savePage tests cover multiple conditions: saving a new page, handling duplicate URLs, updating an existing page, and managing error callbacks for both save and update operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types  
  The test suite includes cases where the page type is empty or the URL is empty (or equal to "new"), and checks that error notifications are broadcast appropriately, addressing these edge cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly  
  The deletePage tests simulate a successful deletion by verifying that REST.content.delete (and the related deletion calls) is made and that the redirection occurs as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions  
  Tests for localVersion and deleteNewerVersion explicitly verify that the controller restores Page properties from localStorage and clears the stored values, correctly handling page version conflicts.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components  
  While the test suite is comprehensive, the actual code coverage percentage isnâ€™t directly measurable from the provided snippet. The inclusion of a coverage reporter in the Karma configuration and extensive tests across various components give high confidence (90%) that code coverage exceeds 80%.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling  
  Several tests use spies to confirm that events (via $rootScope.$broadcast) are correctly triggered in response to various controller actions, ensuring proper event handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality  
  Tests check that the scheduleDate is correctly handled (e.g., setting it to today when not provided or when the path is "/new"), ensuring expected date management within the application.
