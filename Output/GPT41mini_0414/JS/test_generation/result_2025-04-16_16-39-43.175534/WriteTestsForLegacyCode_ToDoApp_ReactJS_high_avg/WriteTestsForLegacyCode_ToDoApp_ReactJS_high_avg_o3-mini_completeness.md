# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering  
  The provided app.test.tsx contains a test ("renders header and input field") that confirms the component is rendered correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos  
  The test ("adds new todo on Enter key press") in app.test.tsx verifies that new todos are added correctly when the Enter key is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos  
  The test ("toggles all todos when toggle-all checkbox is changed") confirms that the functionality to toggle all todos is present and works correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos  
  There are tests for routing and filter-related behavior (e.g., "initializes router and sets nowShowing state") which verify that filtering (by All, Active, Completed) works as intended.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The test ("clears completed todos when clear button clicked") validates that the clearing of completed todos is correctly implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering  
  The todoItem.test.tsx file includes a test ("renders todo item with correct title and checkbox state") ensuring proper rendering of the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos  
  The tests for toggling (e.g., "calls onToggle when checkbox is clicked"), destroying ("calls onDestroy when destroy button clicked"), and editing (e.g., "enters edit mode on label double click") are present and verify the expected behaviors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events  
  Tests such as "calls onSave on Enter key with non-empty input", "calls onDestroy on Enter key with empty input", and "calls onCancel on Escape key and resets editText" confirm that keyboard events are correctly handled.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts  
  The footer.test.tsx file contains tests ("renders count and pluralizes correctly") that verify the component renders counts properly for singular and plural cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation  
  The test ("highlights the correct filter link") in footer.test.tsx confirms that the filter navigation is implemented as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The test ("renders clear completed button only if completedCount > 0") ensures that the clear completed button is conditionally rendered and functions correctly when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos  
  The todoModel.test.ts file includes tests for adding ("adds a todo and informs subscribers"), toggling ("toggles a single todo" and "toggles all todos to completed"), saving ("saves a todo title"), and destroying ("destroys a todo").

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions  
  The test ("subscribes and calls onChanges on inform") explicitly checks the subscribe and inform functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The test ("clears completed todos") confirms that the clearing of completed todos is working as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation  
  The test ("generates a uuid string of correct format") in utils.test.ts verifies that uuid generation meets the required format.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality  
  The test ("pluralizes correctly") clearly checks that the pluralize function behaves as expected across counts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations  
  Tests ("stores and retrieves data from localStorage" and "returns empty array if no data in localStorage") verify proper interactions with localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function  
  The test ("extends objects shallowly") confirms that the extend function merges objects correctly.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx  
  Most test files are named following the [filename].test.tsx convention (e.g., todoItem.test.tsx, app.test.tsx, footer.test.tsx). However, some tests for non-component logic (todoModel and utils) are named with a .test.ts extension. This is acceptable given their context, but it slightly deviates from the strict naming guideline mentioned. Hence, assigned confidence of 90%.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data  
  Sample todo data is defined in multiple test files (e.g., in app.test.tsx and todoModel.test.ts) and is used consistently to verify functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented  
  The routing functionality is properly tested by mocking the global Router (in setupTests.ts) and through tests in app.test.tsx that simulate route changes.
