# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x
  
  The implementation uses React hooks like useState, useRef, useEffect, which are compatible with React 18.x, and the import statement `import React, { useState, useRef, useEffect... } from 'react';` confirms the code is using React.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
  
  The code uses proper TypeScript syntax with well-defined interfaces (`Option`, `SearchableSelectProps`), type annotations for state variables, and proper typing for event handlers (KeyboardEvent, FocusEvent, MouseEvent).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling
  
  The answer includes a complete `index.css` file with all necessary styles for the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments
  
  The code is clean, well-structured, and doesn't contain any TODO comments or debugging artifacts.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility
  
  The component properly uses React's useState hook to manage state for isOpen, searchTerm, focusedIndex, and the selected value is managed through props.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props
  
  The component accepts multiple props through the `SearchableSelectProps` interface, including options, placeholder, onChange, value, and ariaLabel, making it highly configurable and reusable.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection
  
  The component implements comprehensive keyboard navigation with the handleKeyDown function, supporting arrow keys, Enter, and Escape keys for navigation and selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions
  
  The component uses React's useRef hook appropriately for referencing DOM elements (containerRef, inputRef, listRef) and interacts with them in a React-friendly way.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques
  
  The component properly manages focus by focusing the input when the dropdown opens, returning focus to the container when closed, and maintaining focus state during keyboard navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
  
  The component includes appropriate ARIA attributes such as aria-haspopup, aria-expanded, aria-controls, aria-selected, and role attributes to ensure accessibility.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  There are no explicit console errors or warnings in the code, but there is a type mismatch in the event handler for outside clicks that could potentially cause TypeScript errors. The `handleClickOutside` function is defined as accepting `MouseEvent<Document>` but is attached to document's 'mousedown' event, which would provide a regular MouseEvent, not a React synthetic event.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component
  
  The component uses state efficiently and doesn't show obvious causes of unnecessary re-renders. However, it's missing dependency arrays in some useEffect hooks, which could potentially cause extra renders. The effect for handling outside clicks should include a dependency array to prevent recreating the event listener on every render.
