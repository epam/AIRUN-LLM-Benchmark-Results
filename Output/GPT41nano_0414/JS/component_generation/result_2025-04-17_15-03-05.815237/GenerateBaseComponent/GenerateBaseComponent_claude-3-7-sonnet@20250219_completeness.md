  The implementation includes an event listener for clicks outside the component, but there's a type mismatch in the `handleClickOutside` function. It's defined with `event: MouseEvent<Document>` but is used with document's native event listeners which expect a regular MouseEvent, not React's MouseEvent. This could cause TypeScript errors, but the functionality would still work in runtime.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused
