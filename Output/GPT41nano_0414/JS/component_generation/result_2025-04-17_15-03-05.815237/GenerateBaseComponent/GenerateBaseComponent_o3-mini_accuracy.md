# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  The code is written using React functional components with hooks, consistent with React 18.x requirements.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  The TSX files include explicit type definitions for props, refs, and state, indicating proper TypeScript usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  The provided implementation includes an "index.css" file with relevant styles for the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  There are no TODO comments and the code is formatted in a clean, production-ready manner.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  The component uses useState effectively to manage both the selection state and the dropdown's open/close state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  The component accepts customizable props (such as options, placeholder, onChange, value, and ariaLabel), making it reusable.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  The code contains comprehensive key handling (ArrowDown, ArrowUp, Enter, Escape) ensuring smooth keyboard accessibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  The usage of useRef to manage DOM elements and useEffect for event listeners follows React best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  Focus is appropriately moved to the input when the dropdown opens and returned to the container when it closes.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  Proper ARIA attributes (such as aria-haspopup, aria-expanded, role="combobox", and role="listbox") are correctly applied.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  While the code appears clean and adheres to best practices, without runtime testing there is a slight uncertainty. However, based on the static analysis, it should be free of console errors or warnings.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  The component manages state appropriately, and while the filtered options are computed on every render, this is typical for this use case. In the context of a moderate options list, this approach is acceptable. For very large lists, further optimizations (e.g., memoization) might be considered, but it passes for intended usage.
