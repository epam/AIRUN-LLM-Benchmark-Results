# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component renders a container with the "select-display" element along with a conditional dropdown, which fulfills this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  The dropdown, when open, contains an <input> element with the class "search-input" that is used for filtering options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The component accepts a single selected value via the "value" prop and returns the selected option through the onChange callback.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The handleKeyDown function handles "ArrowDown" and "ArrowUp" events to navigate through the available options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  When an option is focused, pressing "Enter" triggers the selection logic which calls the onChange callback and closes the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  The component listens for the "Enter" key when closed and opens the dropdown accordingly, as implemented in the handleKeyDown function.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  In the closeDropdown function, focus is returned to the containerRef (the select element), satisfying this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  Clicking on an option triggers the selectOption function, which in turn calls closeDropdown to close the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  The Enter key selection in the keyboard event triggers an option selection which also calls closeDropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  Pressing the "Escape" key within the handleKeyDown function causes the dropdown to close.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  Using an event listener in a useEffect hook, clicking outside the component invokes closeDropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  When the component is focused and closed, pressing "Enter" opens the dropdown as per the handleKeyDown implementation.
