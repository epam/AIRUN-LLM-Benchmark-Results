# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The application fetches character data from the SWAPI API endpoint `https://swapi.dev/api/people` and displays the characters in a list format.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The code includes a loading state with a conditional render: `if (loading) { return <div style={{ textAlign: 'center', marginTop: '2rem' }}>Loading characters...</div>; }` which displays a loading message while data is being fetched.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The code maps through all characters received from the API response and renders each one as a list item: `{characters.map((character) => (<li key={character.url}...>...</li>))}`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  The provided code does not contain any search functionality, filters, or user input fields. It simply displays the data fetched from the API.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character is displayed with its name as shown in the code: `{character.name}` within each list item.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The code includes typical Create React App structure with package.json, App.tsx, and index.tsx files. There are also notes explaining how to set up the project using Create React App with the TypeScript template.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The application uses three state variables:
  - `characters` to store the character data
  - `loading` to track the loading state
  - `error` to handle potential error messages

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each list item uses the character's URL as a unique key: `key={character.url}`, which is a good practice for React list rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  The application handles three possible states:
  1. Loading state (displaying a loading message)
  2. Error state (displaying an error message)
  3. Success state (displaying the list of characters)
  
  If the characters array is empty after a successful fetch, the code would render an empty list, which is appropriate behavior.
