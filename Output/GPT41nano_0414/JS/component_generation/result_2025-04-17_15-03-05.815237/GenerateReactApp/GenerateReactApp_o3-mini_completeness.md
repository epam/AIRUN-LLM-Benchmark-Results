# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The application fetches data from the SWAPI via Axios and maps over the returned characters to render a list in the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The code displays a loading message ("Loading characters...") while the data is being fetched.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  Once the fetch is complete, the code renders the full list of characters using the mapped array from the API response.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  The implementation is focused solely on fetching and displaying data, with no search or input controls present.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each list item renders the character’s name, ensuring that the character entry is displayed appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The provided package.json and file structure indicate that the application has been set up using Create React App with a TypeScript template.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The implementation uses React’s useState hook to manage state for the characters, loading indicator, and error handling effectively.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  The list items use character.url as a unique key, satisfying the requirement for optimal rendering in React.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  The application does not explicitly handle the case where the API returns an empty list (e.g., by displaying a message like “No characters found”). While rendering an empty list is acceptable in some circumstances, handling empty states more gracefully could improve user experience. This step is rated with 90% confidence because it is somewhat subjective; however, explicit empty state messaging can provide clearer UI feedback.
