# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name
  
  The code clearly includes a search input field with appropriate properties including placeholder text, value binding to `searchQuery`, and an onChange handler that updates the search state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests
  
  A loading indicator is implemented with the conditional rendering `{loading && <div>Loading...</div>}` which displays during API requests.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query
  
  The useEffect hook that calls `fetchCharacters` runs on component mount since it depends on `debouncedSearchQuery` and `fetchCharacters`, and `searchQuery` is initialized as an empty string.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type
  
  The implementation uses a debounce mechanism via the `useDebounce` custom hook that triggers API calls after users pause typing (500ms delay), ensuring dynamic updates without overwhelming the API.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found
  
  The code includes a specific condition to display "No characters found" when `!loading && characters.length === 0 && !error`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design
  
  The input field includes responsive styling with `width: '100%'` and `boxSizing: 'border-box'`, and the overall component has a `maxWidth` with centered layout.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response
  
  The code maps through the `characters` array and renders each character's name in a list item when data is available.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed
  
  Error handling is implemented in the `fetchCharacters` function with try/catch, and error state is displayed to the user when API requests fail.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props
  
  TypeScript interfaces are properly defined for `Character`, `ApiResponse`, and the component itself is typed as `React.FC`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities
  
  The implementation maintains core functionality of displaying Star Wars characters while adding the search capability, and includes additional features like showing the total count of results.
