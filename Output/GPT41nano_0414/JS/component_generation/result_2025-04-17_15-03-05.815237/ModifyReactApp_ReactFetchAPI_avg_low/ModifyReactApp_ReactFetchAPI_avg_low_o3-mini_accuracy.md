# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type  
  The input field is wired to the handleInputChange function, which correctly updates the searchQuery state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls  
  The useDebounce hook is implemented with a 500ms delay, which falls within the acceptable range of 300-500ms.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured  
  The code uses axios.get with a generic type for the API response and configures the search query via params.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses  
  The code defines interfaces for Character and ApiResponse, types the useState hooks, and applies React.FC for the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters  
  The axios request correctly constructs the URL by passing the search parameter in the request configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate  
  useCallback is used for the fetchCharacters function and useMemo is used to compute the character count, ensuring performance optimizations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback  
  The try/catch block in the fetchCharacters function properly catches errors, sets an error state, and displays an error message to the user.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing  
  The debounced search query (via useDebounce) is used in the useEffect hook to trigger API calls only after the user pauses typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices  
  State for loading, error, searchQuery, and characters is managed correctly with useState hooks, adhering to React best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code  
  All imports are used appropriately, and the code is clean without commented-out blocks or unnecessary code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests  
  The loading state is set to true before the API call and appropriately toggled off in the finally block after the request completes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns  
  The component is implemented as a functional component using hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo), in line with React 18.x patterns.
