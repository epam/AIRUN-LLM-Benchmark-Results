# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The provided code includes an input field with the placeholder "Search characters..." and uses its value (via state) to filter the list through API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  A loading indicator is rendered when the "loading" state is true, ensuring the user sees a "Loading..." message during data fetches.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  The useEffect hook calls fetchCharacters on mount with the default empty string from searchQuery (after debouncing), guaranteeing that initial data is loaded properly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  The search input's onChange event updates the search state, which is then debounced and used to fetch updated search results dynamically.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  When there are no characters (and no error, and loading is false), the UI displays a message "No characters found." indicating to the user that the search yielded no results.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The inline styles (such as max-width, margin, and width set to 100%) suggest the component is designed to be responsive. However, while the implementation meets basic responsive design criteria, additional media queries or more robust styling might further improve responsiveness. This slight nuance makes me 95% confident rather than 100%.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  The code correctly maps over the "characters" state to render a list of character names (using their unique URLs as keys) once data is successfully fetched.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  While the implementation includes a try-catch block within the async API call and updates an error state to display messages, it does not implement a dedicated React Error Boundary component. Given that the requirements seem to be catered to API error handling (and not component-level error boundaries), the approach is acceptable. I'm 95% confident because a more comprehensive solution might include a dedicated ErrorBoundary for catching render errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The code defines interfaces for Character and ApiResponse, and also correctly utilizes TypeScript for typing the custom hook and component props, ensuring type safety.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The implementation adds search and debouncing features while preserving initial character list fetching, error handling, and loading indication. This indicates that the core functionality remains intact along with the new features.
