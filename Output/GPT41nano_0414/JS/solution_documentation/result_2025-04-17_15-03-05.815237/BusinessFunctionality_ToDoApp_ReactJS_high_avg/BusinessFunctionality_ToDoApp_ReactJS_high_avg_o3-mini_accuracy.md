  The components such as TodoApp, TodoItem, and TodoFooter are explicitly identified and their roles are clearly explained.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of local storage for data persistence  
  The document accurately notes that persistence is achieved via localStorage in the TodoModel component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the state management approach using the TodoModel  
  The explanation of how TodoModel maintains the list of todos and handles data persistence is complete and precise.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the routing mechanism for filtering todos
