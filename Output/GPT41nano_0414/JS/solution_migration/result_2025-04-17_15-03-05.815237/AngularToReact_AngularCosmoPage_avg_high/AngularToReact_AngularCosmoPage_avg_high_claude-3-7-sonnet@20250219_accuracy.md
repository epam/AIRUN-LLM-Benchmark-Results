# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props
  
  The code consistently uses TypeScript with explicit type annotations for variables, function parameters, and component props. For example, the `Page.tsx` component uses `React.FC<PageProps>` type, and the `PageState` interface is defined with specific types for each property.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management
  
  The code properly implements Redux Toolkit with the `createSlice` function for state management, as shown in `pageSlice.ts`. The store is configured using `configureStore` from Redux Toolkit, and proper types for the state and dispatch are exported.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components
  
  All components in the code are implemented as functional components using the React.FC type annotation, such as `const Page: React.FC<PageProps> = () => {...}`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately
  
  The code demonstrates appropriate use of React hooks. For example, `useState` for local state management, `useEffect` for side effects and synchronization with Redux, and `useCallback` is mentioned in imports.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource
  
  The code uses axios for API communication in the `services/api.ts` file, with a well-structured API client.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components
  
  Form elements in the `Page.tsx` component are properly implemented as controlled components with value and onChange handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation
  
  React Router is correctly implemented in the `App.tsx` file with Routes and Route components from react-router-dom.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization
  
  The code implements internationalization using `i18next` and `react-i18next`, with proper setup in the `i18n/index.ts` file and usage in components via the `useTranslation` hook.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization
  
  While code splitting is mentioned in the "Additional Components & Features" section with reference to React.lazy and Suspense, there isn't concrete implementation shown in the code snippets. However, the architecture suggests awareness of this requirement.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations
  
  React.memo is mentioned in the "Additional Components & Features" section, but no explicit example is provided in the code snippets. The architecture acknowledges the need for memoization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks
  
  The useEffect hook in the Page component correctly includes all dependencies in its dependency array: `[localTitle, localDescription, localUrl, dispatch]`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models
  
  The code defines proper TypeScript interfaces, such as `PageState` in the `pageSlice.ts` file, with detailed type information for all properties.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state
  
  Redux selectors are correctly used with the useSelector hook, as demonstrated in the Page component: `const page = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.page);`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations
  
  The code exports action creators from the pageSlice (`setPage`, `resetPage`, `updateField`) and demonstrates their usage in components with the dispatch function.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks
  
  A custom `useLocalStorage` hook is implemented in `hooks/useLocalStorage.ts` which properly handles reading from and writing to localStorage with type safety.
