# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props  
  All components (e.g., Page.tsx, PageForm.tsx, store.ts, and hooks) are written in TypeScript and use explicit interfaces (such as PageState and PageProps) for data and props.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management  
  The answer clearly shows the usage of Redux Toolkit’s createSlice in features/pageSlice.ts, which manages the global state for the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components  
  The provided code examples (Page.tsx, App.tsx) are implemented as React functional components.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately  
  The components make appropriate use of useState and useEffect. Although useCallback is imported, its usage is not evident in the code snippet. This is acceptable if the functions are not computationally heavy, but the absence of explicit use of useCallback/useMemo in potentially reusable functions slightly lowers confidence.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource  
  The api.ts file demonstrates the use of axios for communicating with the backend API, replacing the AngularJS $resource approach.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components  
  The Page component uses controlled inputs with local state for title, description, and URL, ensuring form elements are fully controlled.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation  
  The App.tsx example properly implements react-router-dom with Routes and Route components for navigation between pages.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization  
  The provided i18n/index.ts file demonstrates the use of react-i18next for internationalization.

- **Fail** (80%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization  
  The answer only mentions using React.lazy and Suspense for route-based code splitting in the “Additional Components & Features” section. No concrete implementation is provided, so the actual application of code splitting is not demonstrated.

- **Fail** (80%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations  
  Although the strategy suggests wrapping expensive components in React.memo, no code examples of React.memo usage are provided. This is a recommendation rather than an implementation, so it does not fully meet the evaluation step requirements.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks  
  The useEffect hook in Page.tsx is provided with an appropriate dependency array, ensuring that the effect runs correctly only when its dependencies change.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models  
  Interfaces such as PageState and PageProps are clearly defined to enforce strict typing for data models and component props.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state  
  The code uses useSelector (e.g., in Page.tsx) to access the Redux state, which is the correct approach for reading global state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations  
  The createSlice implementation includes explicit action creators (setPage, resetPage, updateField) to manage state changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks  
  The custom hook useLocalStorage.ts provides a proper implementation for saving and retrieving values from local storage.
