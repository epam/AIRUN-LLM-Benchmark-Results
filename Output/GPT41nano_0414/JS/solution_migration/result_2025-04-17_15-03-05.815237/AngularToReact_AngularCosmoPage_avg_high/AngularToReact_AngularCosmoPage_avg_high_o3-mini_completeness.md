# Evaluation Report

- **Fail (100%)**: Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
  The provided answer outlines a migration plan and includes snippets for creating and updating pages as well as API endpoints for deletion. However, the duplicate functionality is only mentioned in comments (in "PageForm.tsx") without an accompanying implementation. This lack of concrete code for duplication leads to a failure in fully meeting the requirement.

- **Fail (100%)**: Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
  Although the state structure (with a "type" field) is defined in the Redux slice, there is no UI or code logic demonstrated for selecting or managing the page type. The answer does not cover a component or mechanism to handle page type selection.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
  The answer provides a clear implementation in the "Page.tsx" component. The code listens to title changes and auto-generates a URL by transforming the title into a URL-friendly format. This functionality is properly demonstrated in the provided snippet.

- **Fail (100%)**: Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
  Although the plan mentions additional form fields (like tags) for page management, there is no actual implementation or component shown that handles tag management or implements autocomplete suggestions.

- **Fail (100%)**: Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
  The Redux state includes a "publish" field with possible values ('Y', 'N', 'schedule'), but no UI components or explicit controls are provided to let the user select between publish statuses (e.g., publish, draft). This results in a failure for this functionality.

- **Fail (100%)**: Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
  The state slice defines a "scheduleDate" field and initializes it with the current ISO date string. However, there is no UI component or logic shown that allows the user to modify or set a scheduled publishing date, which is required for complete functionality.

- **Fail (100%)**: Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
  Although a custom hook "useLocalStorage" is provided, the answer does not include any implementation for comparing different versions stored in local storage or restoring them as part of the page management process.

- **Fail (100%)**: Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
  There is no evidence in the code snippets or plans that a notification system (e.g., toast messages or similar feedback for success/error events) has been integrated into the migration.

- **Fail (100%)**: Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
  The provided components lack any specific form validation logic. There is no use of validation libraries (such as React Hook Form) or custom validation code to enforce required fields like URL or page type.

- **Fail (100%)**: Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
  While the "services/api.ts" file includes several endpoint functions (for blocks and content), only a subset of potential endpoints is demonstrated. The answer does not fully replicate or document all API endpoints from the original AngularJS code, relying mainly on examples rather than comprehensive coverage.

- **Fail (100%)**: Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
  The "extras" field is defined in the PageState interface, but there is no corresponding UI or business logic provided to handle extras management beyond its initialization. This omission means the extras functionality is not fully implemented.

- **Fail (100%)**: Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
  The migration plan does not include any code or explanation related to revision history. There is no mechanism shown for tracking changes, comparing versions, or maintaining a history of revisions.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
  The provided project structure clearly separates concerns into folders (e.g., "app/components", "features", "services", "hooks", etc.). This organization suggests a deliberate separation of business logic (Redux slices, API services) from UI components.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
  The answer includes a proper configuration for react-i18next and demonstrates usage of the translation function (t) within components. This implementation meets the requirement of preserving translation functionality.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
  Through the "App.tsx" file using React Router with routes like "/page/:id" and "/new", the answer reflects a URL structure that parallels the original applicationâ€™s navigation. This consistency indicates that the URL structure and parameters are maintained.
