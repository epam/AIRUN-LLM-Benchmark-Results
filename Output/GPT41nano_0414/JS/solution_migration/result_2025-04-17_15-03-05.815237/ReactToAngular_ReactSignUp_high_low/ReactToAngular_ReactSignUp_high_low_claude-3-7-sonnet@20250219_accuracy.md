# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling
   
   The component clearly imports FormBuilder, FormGroup, and Validators from '@angular/forms' and uses them to create and manage the signup form with the reactive approach.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)
   
   The validation is properly implemented in the ngOnInit method:
   ```typescript
   name: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3), Validators.maxLength(60)], ...],
   email: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.email], ...],
   password: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.minLength(6)]],
   ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use
   
   The component implements async validators through the nameAsyncValidator() and emailAsyncValidator() methods, which make API calls to check if the name and email are already in use.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched
   
   While the code includes error styling with the 'has-error' class when fields are invalid, there is no implementation for success styling. The HTML uses `[ngClass]="{'has-error': isFieldInvalid('name')}"` which only adds error styling, but doesn't add any success styling when the field is valid.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions
   
   The onSubmit method properly checks form validity, calls the API service's signup method, and dispatches the signupComplete action with the user data.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails
   
   Error messages are displayed using the `isFieldInvalid` and `getErrorMessage` methods, and the HTML includes the appropriate elements to show these messages.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service
   
   There is no implementation of the Title service in the provided code. The component should import and use Angular's Title service to set the page title.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store for state management
   
   The component imports Store from '@ngrx/store' and uses it to dispatch the signupComplete action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress
   
   The submit button is disabled during submission with: 
   ```html
   [disabled]="submitting || signupForm.invalid"
   ```

- **Fail** (90%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses
   
   While there is error handling in the subscribe method for the signup API call, the error handler only sets submitting to false but doesn't provide any specific user feedback or error display mechanism. A more complete implementation would include showing an error message to the user.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management
   
   The component follows Angular structure with proper imports, constructor injection, ngOnInit lifecycle hook, and separation of concerns.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises
   
   The code uses HttpClient through the ApiService, which returns Observables rather than Promises.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements
   
   While the component implements error messages for various validation scenarios, there's no explicit evidence that these match some specific requirements mentioned in the evaluation step. The getErrorMessage method seems to handle standard validation errors, but without the actual requirements document it's not possible to confirm it matches exactly what was specified.
