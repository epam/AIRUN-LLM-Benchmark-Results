# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component includes all three required form fields: name, email, and password
  
  The component includes all three required form fields in both the TypeScript code (FormGroup definition in `ngOnInit()`) and the HTML template with corresponding form controls.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page includes a heading 'Join PodBaby today.'
  
  The HTML template clearly includes the heading `<h2>Join PodBaby today.</h2>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a lead paragraph about membership benefits
  
  The HTML template includes a paragraph with the class "lead" that states "As a member you can subscribe to podcast feeds and keep track of your favorite episodes."

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form includes a submit button with appropriate styling and icon
  
  The form includes a submit button with the class "btn btn-primary" and an icon with class "glyphicon glyphicon-log-in".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a link to the login page with appropriate text
  
  The page includes a link `<a routerLink="/login">Already a member? Log in here.</a>` at the bottom of the form.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the FormGroup component or equivalent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display
  
  The component implements FormGroup with proper validation handling. It includes methods like `isFieldInvalid()` and `getErrorMessage()` to manage error display, and uses `[ngClass]` to apply styling based on field validation state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Icon component or equivalent is implemented for the signup button
  
  The signup button includes an icon using `<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-log-in"></i>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all validation rules are implemented (name length, email format, password length)
  
  All validation rules are implemented in the `ngOnInit()` method of the component:
  - Name: required, minLength(3), maxLength(60)
  - Email: required, email format
  - Password: required, minLength(6)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure asynchronous validation for both name and email uniqueness is implemented
  
  Asynchronous validators for both name and email are implemented with the methods `nameAsyncValidator()` and `emailAsyncValidator()`. These methods check for uniqueness by calling the API service's `isName()` and `isEmail()` methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API integration is complete with proper error handling
  
  The `onSubmit()` method calls the API service's `signup()` method and handles both success (dispatching an action and navigating) and error (setting submitting to false). Error handling could be more comprehensive, but the basic structure is in place.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form layout matches the horizontal form structure specified
  
  The form has a class "form-horizontal" and uses "form-group" div elements to structure the form, which is consistent with horizontal form layout best practices.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure the page has proper document title setting functionality
  
  There's no evidence in the provided code that the document title is being set for the signup page. Typically, this would be done using the Title service from Angular's platform-browser package, but there's no import or usage of this service in the provided code.
