# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The component imports ReactiveFormsModule and builds the form using FormBuilder's fb.group().  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The name control includes Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3), and Validators.maxLength(60). The email control contains Validators.required and Validators.email, and the password control includes Validators.required and Validators.minLength(6).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  Both nameAsyncValidator and emailAsyncValidator are implemented as asynchronous validators that call the respective API endpoints to check for duplication.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The code defines the isFieldInvalid() method and uses it in the template with ngClass to apply an error style. Error messages are rendered using getErrorMessage().

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  The onSubmit() method calls this.api.signup() and, on a successful response, dispatches the signupComplete action using the NgRx store while also handling navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The HTML template shows that when a field is invalid and touched, the error message from getErrorMessage() is displayed in a div.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  There is no use of Angular’s Title service in any of the provided code snippets; hence, the component/page lacks setting a proper page title.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The component dispatches an action via the NgRx store, and the AppModule imports EffectsModule as well as StoreModule, confirming usage of NgRx for state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button is disabled when either the form is invalid or the "submitting" flag is true, ensuring users cannot submit multiple times concurrently.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  The API call in onSubmit() subscribes with both a success callback (dispatching signupComplete and navigating) and an error callback (resetting the submitting flag and suggesting error handling).

- **Pass** (85%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component is generally well-structured, using lifecycle hooks and encapsulating functionality. However, the async validators subscribe to control.valueChanges within the validator function. Although this approach works, it is slightly nonstandard as async validators typically work directly with the control value rather than re-subscribing via valueChanges. This minor concern lowers the confidence a bit, but overall the component adheres to standard practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The ApiService uses Angular’s HttpClient to make HTTP calls, ensuring adherence to Angular standards.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The error messages in getErrorMessage() (e.g., “This field is required”, “Minimum length is …”, “Maximum length is …”, “A valid email address is required”, “This name is already in use”, and “This email is already in use”) match the specified requirements.
