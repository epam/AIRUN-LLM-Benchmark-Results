  A <code>&lt;p class="lead"&gt;</code> element is present with text explaining the benefits of membership.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form includes a submit button with appropriate styling and icon  
  The form includes a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element with classes "btn btn-primary" and an icon element <code>&lt;i class="glyphicon glyphicon-log-in"&gt;</code> inside it, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a link to the login page with appropriate text  
  The template contains a link <code>&lt;a routerLink="/login"&gt;Already a member? Log in here.&lt;/a&gt;</code>, which directs users to the login page.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the FormGroup component or equivalent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display  
  The component makes use of Angularâ€™s ReactiveFormsModule with a properly instantiated FormGroup and includes methods (like <code>isFieldInvalid</code>) to manage error display and field styling.
