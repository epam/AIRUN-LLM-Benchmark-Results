# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The code consistently references Angular 14.x features and syntax, with appropriate imports from Angular core packages.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
  
  NgRx store is clearly implemented with proper setup commands shown (`ng add @ngrx/store`) and store usage demonstrated throughout the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
  
  The implementation includes NgRx effects setup with the command `ng add @ngrx/effects`, although the detailed effects implementation is mentioned but not fully provided in the code snippets.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
  
  The code includes comprehensive implementations of NgRx actions (`todo.actions.ts`), reducers (`todo.reducer.ts`), and selectors (`todo.selectors.ts`) following best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
  
  All components properly use the @Component decorator, and child components utilize @Input and @Output decorators appropriately for property binding and event handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators
  
  The TodoItemComponent properly uses @ViewChild for accessing the edit field element, which replaces React's ref functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
  
  The code demonstrates proper parent-child component communication with @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling, particularly in the TodoItemComponent and FooterComponent.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
  
  The answer mentions creating a TodoService for localStorage persistence, but does not provide the full implementation of this service. However, the overall architecture correctly identifies the need for this approach.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
  
  Dependency injection is properly implemented throughout components, particularly in the TodoComponent constructor where Store is injected.

- **Pass** (80%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
  
  The answer mentions using ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush for performance optimization in the "Additional Best Practices" section, but doesn't show specific implementation in the components. However, the recommendation is correctly made.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
  
  Angular Router is properly implemented with a defined AppRoutingModule and appropriate routes configuration.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code follows Angular style guide conventions for file naming, component organization, and coding patterns, though there may be minor deviations in some areas not explicitly shown.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
  
  The code maintains strong typing throughout with proper interfaces (ITodo) and type annotations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
  
  The answer includes complete Angular template files (.html) that properly convert the React JSX to Angular template syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
  
  React event handlers are properly replaced with Angular event bindings using the syntax (click), (keydown), etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs
  
  There are no TODOs in the provided code snippets; all functionality is implemented.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules
  
  The answer mentions implementing lazy loading for the TodoModule in the "Additional Best Practices" section, though it doesn't provide the specific implementation code. However, the recommendation is correctly made.
