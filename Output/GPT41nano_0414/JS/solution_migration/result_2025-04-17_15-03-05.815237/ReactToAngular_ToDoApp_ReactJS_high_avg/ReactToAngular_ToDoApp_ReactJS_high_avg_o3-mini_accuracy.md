# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The answer clearly states the migration target is “Angular 14.x” and uses Angular CLI commands (e.g., ng new angular-todo), which implies the correct Angular version is intended.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The solution includes commands to add @ngrx/store and uses store selectors, reducers, and actions throughout the code.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  Although the solution shows the command “ng add @ngrx/effects” and mentions effects in the plan, it does not include any actual NgRx Effects implementation or sample effect code handling asynchronous actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  The answer provides comprehensive examples of actions, a reducer, and selectors, clearly outlining state updates and data selection methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  All components (e.g., TodoComponent, TodoItemComponent, FooterComponent) are decorated properly with @Component, and the use of @Input and @Output is correctly demonstrated.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  In the TodoItemComponent, the old React ref concept is clearly replaced with @ViewChild to access the edit field.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  The provided components correctly apply @Input() for passing data and @Output() with EventEmitter for events (e.g., edit, save, cancel, destroy).

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  The plan mentions creating a TodoService for persistence, but the answer does not include any concrete Angular service code to handle data or encapsulate business logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  The code (e.g., in TodoComponent) demonstrates dependency injection by receiving the Store service through the constructor.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  Although the answer mentions using OnPush change detection strategy as a best practice, none of the components explicitly implement ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  The answer includes an AppRoutingModule with defined routes for '', 'active', and 'completed', confirming the use of Angular Router.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code structure (modules, components, state management, naming conventions) follows standard Angular patterns and style guidelines.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  Interfaces such as ITodo and TodoState are defined and used consistently across the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  The answer provides Angular HTML templates for components (e.g., todo.component.html, todo-item.component.html, footer.component.html) instead of JSX.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  The React event handling logic has been replaced by Angular event bindings (e.g., (keydown), (click), (blur)) in the component templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  There are no placeholder TODO comments found in the provided code examples.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  While the answer mentions lazy loading as a best practice for feature modules, the sample code does not include an actual lazy loading implementation or routing configuration that employs lazy loading.
