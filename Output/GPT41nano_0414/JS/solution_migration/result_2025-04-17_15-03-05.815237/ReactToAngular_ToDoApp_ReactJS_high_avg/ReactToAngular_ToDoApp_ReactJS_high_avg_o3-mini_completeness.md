# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The Angular component (TodoComponent) uses an *ngFor directive over the todos observable and the selectors ensure that all todos are fetched and displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoComponent includes an input field with a keydown handler that dispatches the addTodo action when the Enter key is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  The code implements both the individual toggle functionality (via the TodoItemComponent's checkbox) and the overall "toggle all" feature in TodoComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent provides mechanisms to enter an editing mode, update the todo title, and emit save or cancel events.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  The delete functionality is wired up in the TodoComponent template (destroy button in TodoItemComponent) which dispatches a deleteTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  A checkbox in the TodoComponent template (with id "toggle-all") dispatches the toggleAll action reflecting the state of all todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  The implementation includes both selectors for filtering and a FooterComponent that emits filter changes, with corresponding Angular routes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The FooterComponent template shows the active todo count, calculated from the list of todos passed as an input.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The TodoComponent offers a clearCompleted method that dispatches the clearCompleted action which, per the reducer, filters out completed todos.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  Although the plan mentions creating a TodoService for persistence, there is no actual code snippet implementing localStorage persistence. This remains unimplemented in the provided answer.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The provided routing module defines paths for '', 'active', and 'completed', preserving the URL structure akin to the original application.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  The TodoComponent template conditionally renders the main section and footer based on the existence of todos. While it hides these sections when there are no todos, it does not provide any explicit empty-state messaging. This approach is common in TodoMVC examples, although some might expect additional feedback for an empty state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  The "new todo" input field uses an event handler to process the Enter key event for form submissions, which is a standard practice in such applications.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The code is clearly modularized into AppComponent, TodoComponent, TodoItemComponent, and FooterComponent, reflecting a well-structured component hierarchy for the todo application.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  The provided answer includes all major functionalities (adding, editing, toggling, filtering, deleting, clearing completed, and marking all as complete) in the NgRx store logic. However, the absence of actual persistence code (localStorage) introduces a slight reservation in fully matching the original application's business logic.
