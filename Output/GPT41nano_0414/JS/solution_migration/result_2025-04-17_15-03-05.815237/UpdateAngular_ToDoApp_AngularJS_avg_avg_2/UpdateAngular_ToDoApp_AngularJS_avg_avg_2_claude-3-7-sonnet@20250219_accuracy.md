# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator
- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service
  
  While localStorage is used for data persistence in the effects file (`loadTodos$` effect), it would be more appropriate to implement this in a dedicated service. The code shows that localStorage is used, but implementation is incomplete as the `saveTodos$` effect mentions that it should save to localStorage but the actual implementation is missing (it returns an empty array).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions
- **Fail** (80%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings
  
  There's no explicit evidence that the application would have console errors, but there are some potential issues that could cause runtime errors:
  - The `saveTodos$` effect doesn't properly implement the save functionality
  - The filtering mechanism might cause errors as the filter pipe implementation is not provided
  - The store is injected as `private store: Store` without specifying the generic type `Store<AppState>`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design
