# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list
  
  The answer includes a `todo-list` component within the project structure (`src/app/components/todo-list/`). Additionally, the TodoComponent shows implementation of displaying todos through the `todos$` observable and reference to the `selectAllTodos` selector.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos
  
  The TodoComponent includes functionality for adding new todos with the `addTodo()` method and the `newTodo` property to track input. It dispatches the `addTodo` action when a new todo is submitted.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos
  
  The answer mentions a `todo-item` component in the project structure, and includes an `updateTodo` action in the NgRx implementation that handles editing todos. The TodoComponent references to template conversion also mentions converting editing functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos
  
  The answer includes implementation of filtering todos in the TodoComponent with the `setFilter` method and `statusFilter` property. It handles different filter paths ('/', '/active', '/completed').

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics
  
  The TodoComponent includes a `remainingCount$` observable from the `selectRemainingCount` selector, and the selectors file also includes a `selectCompletedCount` selector for tracking completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos
  
  The `addTodo()` method in the TodoComponent and the corresponding NgRx action and reducer clearly implement this functionality, including trimming whitespace and validating that the title is not empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos
  
  The NgRx store includes an `updateTodo` action and corresponding reducer implementation that handles updating a todo's title.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos
  
  The NgRx store includes a `removeTodo` action and corresponding reducer implementation that removes a todo by its ID.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed
  
  The NgRx store includes a `toggleTodo` action and corresponding reducer implementation that toggles a todo's completed status.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The TodoComponent includes a `setFilter` method that handles different filter paths ('/', '/active', '/completed') and sets the appropriate filter condition.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete
  
  The NgRx store includes a `toggleAll` action and corresponding reducer implementation that marks all todos as completed or incomplete. The TodoComponent also has a `toggleAll` method and an `allChecked` property.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos
  
  The NgRx store includes a `clearCompleted` action and corresponding reducer implementation that removes completed todos. The TodoComponent also has a `clearCompleted` method.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos
  
  The TodoComponent includes a `remainingCount$` observable from the `selectRemainingCount` selector, which counts todos that are not completed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage
  
  The effects implementation includes a `saveTodos$` effect that persists todos to localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization
  
  The effects implementation includes a `loadTodos$` effect that loads todos from localStorage on initialization, and the TodoComponent dispatches the `loadTodos` action in `ngOnInit`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing
  
  The answer includes a custom `TodoEscapeDirective` that uses `@HostListener` to listen for the Escape key and call a provided callback function.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo
  
  The answer includes a custom `TodoFocusDirective` that focuses an element when a condition is true, which would be used for focusing the input field when editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original
  
  The answer mentions converting templates from AngularJS to Angular 14.x syntax while maintaining the same functionality and appearance. It provides a table for syntax conversion and examples.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately
  
  The `addTodo` method in the TodoComponent checks if the title is empty after trimming and only adds a todo if the title is not empty.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter
  
  While the solution mentions setting filters based on the URL path (`/`, `/active`, `/completed`), it doesn't explicitly show the code for updating the URL when a filter is selected. However, the Angular Router integration is implied since the project is initialized with routing (`ng new todo-mvc --routing`).
