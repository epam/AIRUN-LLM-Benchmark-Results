# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list  
  The answer includes a “TodoComponent” along with instructions to create a dedicated todo-list component (refer to the “Todo List & Item Components” section).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos  
  The “TodoComponent” contains an addTodo() method along with an input model, satisfying this functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos  
  While an updateTodo action and reducer are provided, there is no dedicated or explicitly detailed component (or UI logic) for editing todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos  
  The answer details a setFilter() method in TodoComponent and discusses filtering in the template conversion, indicating filtering functionality is integrated.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics  
  An observable (remainingCount$) is set up in the TodoComponent, which can be used to display statistics such as the count of remaining todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos  
  The addTodo() function in TodoComponent contains logic to trim and check input before dispatching an addTodo action.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos  
  Although an updateTodo action and reducer exist, there is no provided UI or component logic that demonstrates how a todo is edited.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos  
  The removeTodo action is defined and the reducer updates state accordingly, implying deletion capability; it is also mentioned in the “Todo List & Item Components” section.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed  
  The toggleTodo (and toggleAll) actions and corresponding reducer logic clearly implement marking todos as complete/incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)  
  The setFilter() method in TodoComponent sets the filtering criteria depending on the route, which meets this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete  
  The toggleAll() method dispatches an action that updates the completed state for all todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos  
  A clearCompleted action is defined and handled in the reducer, allowing removal of all completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos  
  The remainingCount$ observable in TodoComponent serves to display the count of active (non-completed) todos.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage  
  The loadTodos$ effect retrieves todos from localStorage. However, the corresponding saveTodos$ effect is incomplete (returns an empty array without saving), so persistence is not fully implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization  
  The loadTodos$ effect explicitly loads todos from localStorage during initialization.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing  
  The provided todoEscape directive uses @HostListener to listen for the Escape key, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo  
  The todoFocus directive is designed to focus the element when the appTodoFocus input becomes true, which addresses this requirement.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original  
  The answer outlines component structure and template conversion but does not include CSS or detailed styling information. Confidence is 90% since it is assumed that careful template migration could preserve the appearance, yet details are missing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately  
  In the addTodo() method, the new todo title is trimmed and checked for non-emptiness before dispatching an addTodo action.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter  
  While the setFilter() method changes the internal filter state, there is no evidence of Router integration or URL updates corresponding to the selected filter.
