# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed

    The code includes the `handleNewTodoKeyDown` function in `App.tsx` that correctly listens for the Enter key, validates the input, dispatches the `addTodo` action, and clears the input field. The implementation appears complete, though I cannot verify runtime behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter

    The code properly filters todos based on the `nowShowing` state using a filter function in the `AppContent` component and renders them via `map()` to `TodoItem` components.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos

    The `handleToggleAll` function in `App.tsx` correctly dispatches the `toggleAll` action when the toggle-all checkbox is changed, and the checkbox is properly bound to the application state.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted

    The `TodoItem` component contains handlers for toggling (`handleToggle`), editing (`handleEdit`, `handleSave`), and deleting (`handleDestroy`) todos. The implementation appears complete, though I'm missing an import for the specific action creators in the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode

    The `TodoItem` component has an `onDoubleClick` handler on the label element that calls `handleEdit()`, which sets the component's editing state to true.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo

    The `handleKeyDown` function in `TodoItem` correctly checks for the Enter key and calls `handleSave()` which dispatches the appropriate action to update the todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value

    The `handleKeyDown` function in `TodoItem` properly identifies the Escape key press, resets the edit text to the original todo title, and exits editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items

    The `TodoFooter` component receives a `count` prop and displays it with the correct pluralization of "item"/"items".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)

    The `TodoFooter` component includes a filters section with links for All, Active, and Completed, each with appropriate click handlers to change the filter state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos

    The `TodoFooter` component conditionally renders a "Clear completed" button that triggers the `onClearCompleted` callback when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence

    The `todosSlice.ts` file includes `loadState` and `saveState` functions that handle localStorage interaction. The `saveState` function is called after each state-modifying action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state

    The main content and footer are conditionally rendered based on the presence of todos, and the "Clear completed" button is only shown when there are completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count

    In the `TodoFooter` component, the code correctly sets `itemWord` to either "item" or "items" based on the count value.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components

    The application is properly divided into focused components: `App`, `TodoItem`, and `TodoFooter`, each handling its specific responsibilities.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality

    The code is organized in a feature-based structure with a dedicated `features` folder for the Redux slice and a `components` folder for UI components. The store is in its own file. This indicates good organization by feature/functionality, though I'm seeing only a partial view of the project structure.
