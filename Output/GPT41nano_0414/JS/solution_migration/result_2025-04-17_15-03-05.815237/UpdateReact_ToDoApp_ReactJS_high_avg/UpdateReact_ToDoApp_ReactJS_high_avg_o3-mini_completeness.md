# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The App componentâ€™s input field registers the Enter key event and dispatches the addTodo action when pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The App component filters todos based on the nowShowing state and maps over the filtered list to render them.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  An input checkbox (with id "toggle-all") is present, and when toggled, it dispatches the toggleAll action to update all todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  In the TodoItem component, there are event handlers to toggle completion, enter editing mode (on double-click), and delete an item.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  The label in the TodoItem component has an onDoubleClick event handler that sets the editing state to true.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  Within the TodoItem component, the keyDown event handler listens for the Enter key to trigger saving of edited todo text.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  The keyDown handler in TodoItem checks for the Escape key, resets the edit text to the original title, and exits editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooter component receives the active count as a prop and renders it accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The TodoFooter component provides filter links for All, Active, and Completed, triggering the respective filtering actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  A clear completed button is conditionally rendered if there are completed todos, and it calls the onClearCompleted handler.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  The todosSlice includes functions to load from and save to localStorage, ensuring persistence of the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  Conditional rendering is implemented in the App component, displaying sections like the main todos list and footer only when appropriate.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  The TodoFooter component correctly pluralizes "item" vs. "items" depending on the count provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The code splits responsibilities among distinct components (AppContent, TodoItem, TodoFooter) to maintain a focused and clear structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The project structure distinguishes files by feature, including a dedicated folder for components and one for Redux functionality (todosSlice), ensuring a well-organized codebase.
