# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration  
  The provided code starts with "npx create-react-app virtual-piano --template typescript" and uses React 18’s createRoot API.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure  
  An interface (SoundMap) is defined to map notes to HTMLAudioElement, showing proper use of TypeScript interfaces.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks  
  Every component (App, Controls, Piano, FullscreenButton) is implemented as a functional component, and hooks like useState, useEffect, and useCallback are appropriately used.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)  
  The code utilizes useState to manage variables (such as isLetters and activeNotes) and useEffect for side effects such as initializing audio and setting up global event listeners.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels  
  Global keyboard event handlers (keydown and keyup) are correctly added in App.tsx using window.addEventListener in a useEffect hook.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events  
  The code implements onMouseDown and onMouseUp handlers on piano keys using React’s synthetic events; however, it does not include handlers for mouseout and mousemove. This may be acceptable depending on the app’s requirements, but it does not fully match the specified set of mouse events.  
  (The slight uncertainty comes from whether the extra events were required for the intended behavior.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment  
  Audio resources are pre-loaded once on component mount using useEffect, and the playback is triggered correctly using the Audio API.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility  
  The FullscreenButton and the toggleFullscreen function correctly invoke the browser’s fullscreen API using a React event handler.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns  
  Conditional classes for active keys and toggle buttons are applied using template literals based on component state.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate  
  Although the code comment suggests the possibility of using React.memo (especially for the Piano component), no such performance optimization has been implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations  
  The audio elements are initialized once using useEffect and managed via refs, ensuring that playback does not conflict with the component lifecycle.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application  
  The code consistently uses TypeScript’s type annotations and interfaces for component props, state, and other structures.
