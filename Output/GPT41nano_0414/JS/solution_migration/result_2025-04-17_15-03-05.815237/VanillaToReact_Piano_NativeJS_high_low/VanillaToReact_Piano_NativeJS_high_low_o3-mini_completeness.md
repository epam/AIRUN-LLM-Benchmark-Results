# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'  
  The code in App.tsx includes a header element with an h1 that contains "Virtual Piano".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons  
  The Controls.tsx component renders two buttons labeled "Notes" and "Letters" appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)  
  The Piano.tsx component maps through both white and black keys arrays and renders the keys as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes  
  Each piano key div includes data-letter and data-note attributes, making it easy to query and manipulate.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked  
  The playNote method looks up the correct sound from the soundMapperRef and plays it, ensuring audio is triggered on clicks.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)  
  The active keys have the class "piano-key-active" added and removed via playNote and resetNote functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes  
  Global event listeners for keydown and keyup are added in App.tsx, mapping specific keys to the correct notes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked  
  The isLetters state is updated via the toggle functions in Controls.tsx and passed down to the Piano component, toggling the display correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes  
  The FullscreenButton component calls the toggleFullscreen function, which uses the Fullscreen API effectively.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly  
  The component maintains active notes using a Set (activeNotes) and a playedRef, which supports multiple keys being active without interference.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys  
  The code handles onMouseDown and onMouseUp events for individual keys. However, it does not implement explicit mouse drag (or mouse enter) behavior that would allow playing notes while dragging the mouse across keys. This might be acceptable depending on requirements, but it does not fully cover "mouse drag" functionality as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information  
  The App.tsx footer includes a div with "2020", meeting this requirement.
