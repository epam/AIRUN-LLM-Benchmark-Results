# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos
  
  The application implements a header in the `TodoHeader.tsx` component which includes an `<h1>todos</h1>` title and a text input with the class "new-todo" and placeholder "What needs to be done?" for creating new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos
  
  The application includes a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos in the `TodoApp.tsx` component under the section with className "main". The toggle-all checkbox is implemented and the TodoList component is included.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button
  
  The `TodoItem.tsx` component correctly implements each todo item with a toggle checkbox (`<input className="toggle" type="checkbox">`), a title display (`<label>`), and a delete button (`<button className="destroy">`).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode
  
  The `TodoItem.tsx` component implements double-click functionality with `onDoubleClick={handleDoubleClick}` that sets the editing state to true, which adds the "editing" class to the li element and renders the edit input field.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The application implements filtering functionality with the filter state in the Redux store and the TodoList component filters todos based on this state. However, there's a small issue in the code where `RootState` is not imported in the `TodoList.tsx`, but it's otherwise correct.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization
  
  The `TodoFooter.tsx` component correctly displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization: `<strong>{activeCount}</strong> {activeCount === 1 ? 'item' : 'items'} left`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter
  
  The `TodoFooter.tsx` component includes filter links for All, Active, and Completed, and uses the `className={filter === f ? 'selected' : ''}` to highlight the current selected filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist
  
  The `TodoFooter.tsx` component conditionally renders the Clear completed button: `{completedCount > 0 && (<button className="clear-completed" onClick={onClearCompleted}>Clear completed</button>)}`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter
  
  The `TodoHeader.tsx` component implements the new todo input with proper handling for the Enter key press in the `handleKeyDown` function that dispatches the `addTodo` action when Enter is pressed with a non-empty title.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos
  
  The `TodoItem.tsx` component includes a toggle checkbox that, when changed, calls the `onToggle` prop which dispatches the `toggleTodo` action in the parent component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once
  
  The `TodoApp.tsx` component includes the toggle-all checkbox that, when changed, dispatches the `toggleAll` action with the checked state of the checkbox.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management
  
  The `TodoItem.tsx` component implements editing functionality with proper focus management using a `useRef` and `useEffect` to focus the input when editing begins. However, there's an issue with the edit functionality as there's no action to update the todo title in the store after editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos
  
  The `TodoItem.tsx` component includes a delete button that, when clicked, calls the `onDelete` prop which dispatches the `deleteTodo` action in the parent component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos
  
  The `TodoApp.tsx` component implements the `handleClearCompleted` function that dispatches the `clearCompleted` action, and this function is passed to the `TodoFooter` component which renders the "Clear completed" button.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status
  
  The `TodoList.tsx` component correctly filters todos based on the filter prop, showing all todos when filter is 'all', only active todos when filter is 'active', and only completed todos when filter is 'completed'.
