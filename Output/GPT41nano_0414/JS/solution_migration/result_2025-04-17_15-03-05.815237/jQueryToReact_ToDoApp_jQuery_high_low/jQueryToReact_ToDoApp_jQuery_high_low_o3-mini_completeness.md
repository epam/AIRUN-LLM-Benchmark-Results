# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos  
  The TodoHeader component clearly renders a header with an h1 element ("todos") and an input field (with placeholder "What needs to be done?") for creating new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos  
  The TodoApp component conditionally renders a "main" section that contains a toggle-all checkbox (with id "toggle-all") and renders the TodoList to display todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button  
  In TodoItem, we see an input of type checkbox to toggle completion, a label that displays the todo title, and a button with class "destroy" for deleting the todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode  
  The TodoItem component registers a double-click event on the label which triggers editing mode, setting state to enable an input element for editing the text.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The TodoFooter component displays filter options ("all", "active", "completed") and TodoList receives a filter prop to display the appropriate todos based on the filtering criteria.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization  
  The TodoFooter uses a span with class "todo-count" that shows the active count and switches between "item" and "items" based on the count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter  
  Each filter link in the footer checks if it matches the current filter value via a conditional className (`'selected'`), highlighting the active filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist  
  The TodoFooter conditionally renders a button with class "clear-completed" if completedCount is greater than zero.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter  
  In TodoHeader, pressing Enter in the input field triggers the onKeyDown event handler that dispatches the addTodo action when the trimmed title is not empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos  
  Each todo item includes a checkbox input that calls the onToggle handler (dispatching toggleTodo action) to change its completed status.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once  
  TodoApp includes a toggle-all checkbox that, when changed, dispatches toggleAll to update all todosâ€™ completion status at once.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management  
  In TodoItem, enabling editing (by double-click) switches to an input field and employs a useRef along with useEffect to set focus on the editing field, ensuring proper focus management.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos  
  The destroy button in each TodoItem component triggers the onDelete handler to delete the specific todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos  
  The TodoFooter provides a "Clear completed" button that, when clicked, dispatches the clearCompleted action to remove all completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status  
  The TodoList component uses the provided filter prop to select and render a subset of todos from the Redux state based on whether they are active, completed, or all.
