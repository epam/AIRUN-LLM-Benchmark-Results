  - React Router: Included as react-router-dom with proper setup in App.tsx

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm documentation includes all available CLI commands with explanations for each command's purpose
  
  The documentation includes a comprehensive table with all CLI commands:
  - `npm run dev` - Starts development server
  - `npm run build` - Builds for production
  - `npm run serve` - Previews production build
  - `npm test` - Runs tests
  - `npm run test:ui` - Launches interactive test mode
  
  Each command includes its purpose and usage information.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that package.json includes all necessary dependencies for the required technologies
  
  The package.json file includes all necessary dependencies:
  - React core: react, react-dom
  - Redux: redux, react-redux
  - Router: react-router-dom
  - TypeScript: typescript and relevant @types packages
  - Vite: vite, @vitejs/plugin-react
  - Testing: vitest, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the project contains complete configuration files without placeholder comments or TODOs
  
  All configuration files (vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json, package.json) are complete and don't contain any placeholders or TODOs.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the presence of proper TypeScript type definitions throughout the project
  
  TypeScript types are properly implemented throughout the project:
  - Interface for CounterState in counterSlice.ts
  - RootState and AppDispatch type exports in store.ts
  - React.FC type annotations for components
  - Proper typing for Redux selectors and actions

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure testing library configuration is complete with necessary setup files
  
  The testing setup includes:
  - Vitest as the test runner
  - React Testing Library for component testing
  - A sample test file (App.test.tsx) with proper imports and structure
  - Testing scripts in package.json

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the project structure includes directories for components, state management, and routing
  
  The project structure includes:
  - components/ directory for UI components
  - slices/ directory for Redux state management
  - pages/ directory for route components
  - tests/ directory for test files

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the entry point files for the application are properly defined
  
  The entry point files are properly defined:
  - main.tsx serves as the application entry point
  - App.tsx defines the main application component
  - store.ts configures the Redux store

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all configuration follows established best practices for each technology
  
  The configurations follow best practices:
  - Proper React 18 setup with createRoot
  - Redux Toolkit usage with slices pattern
  - React Router v6 implementation with Routes and Route
  - TypeScript strict mode enabled
  - Vite configuration with React plugin

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that build and environment configuration supports production deployment
  
  The build configuration supports production deployment:
  - Build script in package.json runs TypeScript compilation and Vite build
  - Vite configuration includes production-ready settings
  - Scripts for building and serving production builds
