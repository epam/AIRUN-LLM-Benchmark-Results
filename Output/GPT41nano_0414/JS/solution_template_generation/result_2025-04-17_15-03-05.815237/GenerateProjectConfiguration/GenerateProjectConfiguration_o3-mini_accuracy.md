# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Vite is configured as the build tool with appropriate configuration files  
  The provided solution includes a complete vite.config.ts file that imports and uses the React plugin, and it sets up a basic server configuration. This clearly indicates the use of Vite as the build tool.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm TypeScript is properly configured with a tsconfig.json file containing correct compiler options  
  The tsconfig.json is present with modern and strict settings such as "strict": true, "target": "ESNext", and proper module and lib options, which is appropriate for a modern React + TypeScript setup.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the React setup includes necessary entry points and proper component structure  
  The project includes a clear entry point in src/main.tsx, a primary App component in src/App.tsx, and an organized folder structure for components, pages, and tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that Redux is implemented with appropriate store configuration, reducers, and actions  
  Redux is integrated using Redux Toolkit. The store is configured in src/store.ts, with a dedicated counter slice (src/slices/counterSlice.ts) that defines reducers for incrementing, decrementing, and resetting.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify React Router is correctly configured with defined routes and navigation components  
  React Router is used in the App component with defined routes for “/” (Home) and “/counter” (Counter), accompanied by navigation links using the Link component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure testing libraries are properly configured with appropriate test setup files  
  The solution includes Vitest and React Testing Library in the devDependencies and provides sample tests in src/tests/App.test.tsx that correctly validate page content via testing-library.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate package.json includes correct dependencies with compatible version specifications  
  The package.json includes dependencies for React, React DOM, Redux, React Router DOM, and their respective TypeScript types. The version numbers appear compatible and align with current standards.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm package.json contains scripts for development, building, and testing operations  
  The scripts for “dev”, “build”, “serve”, “test”, and “test:ui” are all present, ensuring that common development and production commands are available.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the project structure follows modern React development conventions  
  The project uses a modular structure with a clear separation of concerns (src folder with components, pages, slices for Redux, tests, etc.), aligning with modern best practices in React development.

- **Pass** (90%): Check that configuration files are production-ready with appropriate optimization settings  
  The vite.config.ts is minimal but sufficient for production builds since Vite performs optimizations by default. However, additional specific production optimizations (such as detailed build options) are not explicitly outlined. This basic configuration is acceptable but might be further enhanced in a real-world production environment.
