# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present
- **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented
- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested
- **Pass** (80%): Validate tests for loading and error states

    While the answer mentions testing loading states in the Edge Cases section, it doesn't provide a specific example of testing error states. However, it does reference covering "all branches, including error states" in the Coverage & Mocking section.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance
- **Pass** (90%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested

    The answer mentions focus management in the Accessibility Tests section, including focus trap and focus restoration, but doesn't provide a detailed example test case specifically for focus management.

- **Fail** (80%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering

    The answer doesn't explicitly mention testing placeholder rendering. While it covers value rendering indirectly through various tests of the component with different values, there's no specific test case or mention of testing placeholder functionality.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations

    The answer mentions covering "all props, including custom `filterOption`, `formatOptionLabel`, etc." in the Coverage & Mocking section, but doesn't provide a specific example test for custom formatOptionLabel implementations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)
- **Fail** (90%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)

    While the answer mentions testing loading states, it doesn't specifically address testing indicator components like dropdown arrows and clear buttons. These UI elements are important parts of the Select component interface that should be explicitly tested.
