# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)  
  The answer clearly uses Jasmine for structuring tests and Karma for running them.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints  
  The tests demonstrate the mocking of HTTP endpoints (using $httpBackend) and check that REST API methods (e.g., REST.content.delete) are called appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation  
  The provided tests make use of beforeEach (and include a note on afterEach for cleanup), ensuring that each test runs in an isolated environment.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls  
  The answer includes examples of using $httpBackend.whenGET/POST/PUT/DELETE with mock responses, which prevents any real API calls during testing.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection  
  The code samples use Angularâ€™s inject mechanism to properly set up and pass all necessary services to the test files.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations  
  The tests show a basic handling of asynchronous operations (e.g., by overriding $translate.then). However, explicit handling (like calling $httpBackend.flush() or using done callbacks) for asynchronous API calls is not demonstrated in every case. This minor omission lowers the confidence slightly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies  
  The tests make effective use of spyOn to monitor calls to dependencies (such as $scope.$broadcast, REST.content.delete, and $location.path), ensuring that interactions are properly tracked.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization  
  The tests are well-organized using nested describe blocks along with clear it statements for each test scenario.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls  
  While the answer provides comprehensive examples and even suggests adding tests for error cases, the sample code primarily demonstrates success scenarios. The guidelines for error scenario tests are mentioned but not fully implemented, hence a slightly lower confidence level.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate  
  The tests simulate user interactions by invoking controller functions (e.g., deletePage, savePage) and by manipulating $scope properties, reflecting typical user-driven actions in an AngularJS application.

- **Pass** (80%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage  
  Although the answer suggests using afterEach to clean up mocks if needed, explicit cleanup (for instance, flushing $httpBackend or resetting state after modifying localStorage) is not shown in every snippet. The intent is there, but a more rigorous cleanup pattern would improve this further.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested  
  The test case names (e.g., "should initialize page with Page factory data" and "should call deletePage and trigger API delete") are descriptive and communicate the intended behavior clearly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible  
  The tests focus on checking the observable behavior (such as changes to $scope, correct API calls, and routing changes) rather than relying solely on internal implementation details.
