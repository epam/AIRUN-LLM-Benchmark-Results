# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering  
   The "app.test.tsx" file contains a test ("renders header and input") that verifies component rendering.

2. **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos  
   The test "handles new todo key down with ENTER" validates that a new todo is added when the ENTER key is pressed.

3. **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos  
   The test "toggle all checkbox triggers toggleAll" confirms the toggling of all todos is handled correctly.

4. **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos  
   While the file includes a comment for additional tests (filtering, editing, clearing completed, etc.), there is no explicit test implemented to verify filtering functionality.

5. **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
   Clearing completed todos is mentioned as a potential additional test in comments, but no explicit test case is provided.

6. **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering  
   The "todoItem.test.tsx" file includes a "renders correctly" test that asserts the component renders expected content.

7. **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos  
   The tests "handles toggle checkbox", "handles delete button click", and "double click label triggers edit" collectively cover toggling, destroying, and enabling edit mode.

8. **Fail** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events  
   Although there is a comment suggesting additional tests (such as handling keyDown events), no explicit test for keyboard events is implemented in the provided file.

9. **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts  
   The "footer.test.tsx" file has a test ("renders correct count and filters") that checks the rendered count and DOM elements.

10. **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation  
    The test "filter links have correct class based on nowShowing" verifies that the navigation filters are rendered correctly.

11. **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
    The test "clicking clear completed calls handler" confirms that clearing completed todos triggers the associated handler.

12. **Fail** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos  
    There is no "todoModel.ts" test file included in the answer; hence, tests for these functionalities are missing.

13. **Fail** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions  
    The answer does not include any tests for subscribe and inform functions from the todo model.

14. **Fail** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
    Similarly, there is no test file provided for the todo model that covers clearing completed todos.

15. **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation  
    The "utils.test.ts" file contains a test that confirms the uuid function generates a string of length 36.

16. **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality  
    A test verifying that Utils.pluralize returns the correct singular and plural strings is included.

17. **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations  
    The test "store saves and retrieves data" adequately covers localStorage operations.

18. **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function  
    The "extend merges objects" test confirms that the extend function works as expected.

19. **Fail** (100%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx  
    While component tests adhere to the naming convention (e.g., app.test.tsx, todoItem.test.tsx, footer.test.tsx), the utility tests are in a file named "utils.test.ts". This inconsistency means the naming convention is not uniformly followed.  
    Note: In many projects, non-JSX tests are commonly named with the .test.ts suffix; however, per the specified evaluation requirement, this is marked as a failure.

20. **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data  
    Sample todo data fixtures (e.g., modelMock in app tests and sampleTodo in todoItem tests) are properly provided.

21. **Pass** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented  
    The "app.test.tsx" file includes a mock for the Router, confirming that routing functionality is tested with appropriate mocks.
