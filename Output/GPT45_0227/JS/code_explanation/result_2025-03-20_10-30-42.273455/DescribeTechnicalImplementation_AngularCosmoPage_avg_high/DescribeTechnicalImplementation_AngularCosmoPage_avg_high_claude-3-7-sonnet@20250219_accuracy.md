# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies Angular.js as the framework used
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all factories (REST, Page, Users) are accurately documented with their purposes
- **Pass** (90%): Check that the description of the Page controller and its functionality is technically accurate

    While the documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the Page controller functionality, it refers to it as "pageCtrl" in the sample implementation, but doesn't explicitly name the controller elsewhere. The functionality description appears accurate but without seeing the original code, I cannot be 100% certain all controller functions are covered.

- **Pass** (80%): Validate that the RESTful API endpoints are correctly documented

    The documentation mentions RESTful endpoints and resources like `REST.contentRevisions` and `REST.contentTags.query`, but doesn't provide specific API endpoint URLs or complete request/response specifications. It covers the general purpose but lacks detailed API specifications.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that the explanation of Angular module dependencies ($resource, $location, etc.) is correct

    The documentation mentions `$resource` and implicitly references `$rootScope` for broadcasting events. It also mentions Angular Translate (`pascalprecht.translate`). However, it doesn't explicitly list all dependencies or show how they're injected into the controllers/factories.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the page management features (creating, editing, deleting) are accurately described
- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the documentation accurately explains how the local storage mechanism works

    The documentation mentions that local storage is used to temporarily store unsaved changes, but doesn't go into implementation details like storage keys, serialization methods, or cleanup procedures.

- **Fail** (80%): Check that the description of form validation logic is technically accurate

    The documentation doesn't specifically address form validation logic. While it mentions required fields in the inputs table, it doesn't explain how validation errors are handled, displayed to users, or how the validation logic is implemented in Angular.js.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of publish/schedule date handling is correct
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the tag management and autocomplete feature explanation is technically accurate
- **Pass** (80%): Confirm that the relationship between controllers, factories, and templates is accurately explained

    The documentation mentions that the component uses controllers and factories, and shows a sample HTML implementation, but doesn't provide a complete architectural diagram or detailed explanation of how these components interact at a technical level.

- **Fail** (70%): Check that the documentation correctly identifies and explains the purpose of broadcast events

    While the documentation mentions that notifications are broadcast via Angular `$rootScope.$broadcast`, it doesn't list specific event names, their payloads, or provide examples of components that would listen for these events. The documentation is too vague on this specific requirement.
