# Evaluation Report

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Confirm the component includes a search feature in the dropdown.**
   - **Pass**: The component includes an input field within the dropdown for searching options (`<input ... className="search-input" ... />`).

2. **Check that the component is navigable via keyboard.**
   - **Pass**: The component handles keyboard events (`onKeyDown` handler) for navigation using arrow keys and selection using the Enter key.

3. **Verify items in the dropdown can be selected by pressing the Enter key.**
   - **Pass**: The `handleKeyDown` function includes logic to select an item when the Enter key is pressed (`if (e.key === 'Enter') ... handleSelectOption(filteredOptions[highlightedIndex]);`).

4. **Confirm the dropdown list opens when Enter is pressed.**
   - **Pass**: The `handleKeyDown` function includes logic to open the dropdown when the Enter key is pressed (`if (!isOpen) { setIsOpen(true); ... }`).

5. **Ensure the focus returns to the select component after the dropdown is closed.**
   - **Pass**: The `useEffect` hook includes logic to return focus to the select component when the dropdown is closed (`containerRef.current?.focus();`).

6. **Verify the dropdown closes upon selecting an item via keyboard.**
   - **Pass**: The `handleSelectOption` function includes logic to close the dropdown upon selecting an item (`setIsOpen(false);`).

7. **Verify the dropdown closes upon selecting an item via mouse.**
   - **Pass**: The `handleSelectOption` function is called when an item is clicked (`onClick={() => handleSelectOption(option)}`), which includes logic to close the dropdown (`setIsOpen(false);`).

8. **Confirm the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed.**
   - **Pass**: The `handleKeyDown` function includes logic to close the dropdown when the Escape key is pressed (`if (e.key === 'Escape') { setIsOpen(false); }`).

9. **Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component.**
   - **Pass**: The `handleClickOutside` function includes logic to close the dropdown when clicking outside the component, and this function is correctly added and removed as an event listener in the `useEffect` hook.
