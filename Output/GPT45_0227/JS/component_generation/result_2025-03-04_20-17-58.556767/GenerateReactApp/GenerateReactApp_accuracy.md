# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.
**Pass** - The provided code does not contain any unused imports or code.

### Step 2: Ensure the codebase is structured and follows TypeScript and React best practices (state, hooks, effects).
**Pass** - The codebase is well-structured and follows TypeScript and React best practices, including the use of state, hooks, and effects.

### Step 3: Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.
**Pass** - The application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders. The useEffect hook is properly used to fetch data once when the component mounts.

### Step 4: Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.
**Pass** - The application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.

### Step 5: Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.
**Pass** - The application is free of console errors and warnings.

### Step 6: Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.
**Pass** - The app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.

### Step 7: Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React virtual DOM.
**Pass** - The app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React virtual DOM.

### Step 8: Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React state and props.
**Pass** - The app does not overuse refs for DOM access; it uses React state and props appropriately.

### Step 9: Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.
**Pass** - The app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.

### Step 10: Ensure the code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility.
**Fail** - The code is not decomposed into multiple components; the entire functionality is within a single `App` component.

### Step 11: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
**Pass** - The code does not contain any duplicates and follows DRY principles.

### Step 12: App has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.
**Pass** - The app has the same DOM tree structure and classes as described.

### Step 13: App does correctly use useEffect, avoiding infinite loops.
**Pass** - The app correctly uses useEffect, avoiding infinite loops.

### Step 14: Confirm that axios is installed and listed as a dependency in package.json.
**Pass** - The instructions include installing axios, and it should be listed as a dependency in package.json.

### Step 15: Verify that the fetched data is stored in a state variable using the useState hook.
**Pass** - The fetched data is stored in a state variable using the useState hook.

### Step 16: Verify that the code is optimized and does not contain any unnecessary parts or TODOs.
**Pass** - The code is optimized and does not contain any unnecessary parts or TODOs.

### Step 17: Ensure that TypeScript is correctly integrated and used throughout the codebase.
**Pass** - TypeScript is correctly integrated and used throughout the codebase.

### Step 18: Verify that React.StrictMode is used in index.tsx.
