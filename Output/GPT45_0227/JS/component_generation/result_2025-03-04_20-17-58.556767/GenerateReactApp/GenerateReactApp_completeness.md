# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Ensure that the API call to https://swapi.dev/api/people is made using axios.
**Pass**  
- The code uses `axios.get` to fetch data from `https://swapi.dev/api/people`.

### Step 2: Make sure the data is fetched initially without any input fields.
**Pass**  
- The data is fetched in the `useEffect` hook, which runs on the initial render without any input fields.

### Step 3: Ensure a loader or loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass**  
- The code sets `loading` to `true` initially and displays "Loading..." while the data is being fetched.

### Step 4: Verify that errors are logged to the console if the API call fails.
**Fail**  
- The code does not include any error handling to log errors to the console if the API call fails.

### Step 5: Ensure that the fetched characters are displayed in a list format.
**Pass**  
- The fetched characters are displayed in an unordered list (`<ul>`) with each character in a list item (`<li>`).

### Step 6: Make sure each list item has a unique key derived from the character URL.
**Pass**  
- Each list item uses the character's `url` as the key, ensuring uniqueness.

## Summary

- **Total Steps Evaluated:** 6
- **Number of Passed Steps:** 5
- **Number of Failed Steps:** 1

### Conclusion
The provided React application meets most of the evaluation criteria but lacks error handling for the API call. Adding error handling to log errors to the console would make the implementation complete.
