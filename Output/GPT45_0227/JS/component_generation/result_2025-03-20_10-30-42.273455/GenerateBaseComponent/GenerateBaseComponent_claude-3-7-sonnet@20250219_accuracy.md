# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x
  
  The component imports from React and uses modern React hooks like useState, useRef, useEffect, and useCallback, which are compatible with React 18.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
  
  The code includes proper TypeScript type definitions throughout, including interfaces for Options, SearchableSelectProps, and React.FC typing for the component. All props and state variables have appropriate type definitions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling
  
  The component includes an index.css file with comprehensive styling for the dropdown, options, highlighting, and other visual elements.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments
  
  The code is clean, well-organized, and free of any TODO comments or incomplete sections.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility
  
  The component uses appropriate React useState hooks for managing state:
  - `isOpen` for dropdown visibility
  - `searchTerm` for the search input value
  - `highlightedIndex` for keyboard navigation
  - The selected option is managed via props

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props
  
  The component accepts multiple customizable props:
  - `options`: Array of selectable options
  - `placeholder`: Customizable placeholder text
  - `onChange`: Callback for selection changes
  - `selected`: Currently selected option

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection
  
  The component implements a comprehensive handleKeyDown function that handles:
  - Enter for opening dropdown and selecting items
  - Escape for closing the dropdown
  - Arrow keys for navigating through options
  - The implementation correctly manages focus and prevents default browser actions

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions
  
  The component uses useRef appropriately for DOM element references:
  - `containerRef` for the main component container
  - `inputRef` for the search input
  
  It also uses proper DOM event handling with addEventListener and removeEventListener in useEffect for click outside detection.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques
  
  The component implements proper focus management:
  - Focuses the search input when opening the dropdown
  - Returns focus to the container when closing the dropdown
  - Uses tabIndex and keyboard event handlers appropriately

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
  
  The component includes appropriate ARIA attributes:
  - `aria-haspopup="listbox"` on the combobox element
  - `aria-expanded={isOpen}` to indicate dropdown state
  - `role="combobox"` on the container
  - `role="listbox"` on the options list
  - `role="option"` on each option
  - `aria-selected` to indicate the selected option
  - `aria-label` on the search input

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  The code doesn't contain any obvious sources of console errors or warnings. Event handlers properly prevent default actions where needed, and cleanup functions are provided for event listeners.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component
  
  The component makes appropriate use of useCallback for all handler functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Dependencies are correctly specified in dependency arrays, and the component's structure follows React best practices to minimize re-renders.
