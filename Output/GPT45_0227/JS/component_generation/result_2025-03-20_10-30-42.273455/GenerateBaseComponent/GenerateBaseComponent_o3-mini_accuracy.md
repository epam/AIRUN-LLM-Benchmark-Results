# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  The component is written as a functional component using React hooks (useState, useRef, useEffect, useCallback). Although the code does not explicitly mention React 18.x, its syntax and patterns are fully compatible with React 18.x. I am 90% confident because the code does not highlight version-specific features that uniquely identify React 18.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  The component is implemented in a .tsx file, uses interfaces (Option, SearchableSelectProps), and includes proper type annotations. This satisfies the TypeScript requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  The project structure clearly shows an index.css file, and the component imports it (import './index.css';), fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  The code is well-organized and free from extraneous comments or TODOs, making it clean and production-ready.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  The implementation correctly uses useState for managing state (selected, isOpen, searchTerm, highlightedIndex). State transitions for dropdown visibility and selection are handled appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  The component accepts props for options, placeholder, onChange callback, and an optional selected value. These customizable props make the component reusable in different contexts.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  The handleKeyDown function is implemented to support Enter, Escape, ArrowDown, and ArrowUp events, enabling keyboard navigation and selection as required.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  The component properly employs useRef to reference DOM elements and uses useEffect to manage adding and removing event listeners (e.g., for click outside detection), adhering to React best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  Focus management is handled by directing focus to the input when opening the dropdown and returning focus to the container when closing. These practices ensure effective focus management.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  The component includes ARIA attributes such as aria-haspopup, aria-expanded, role="combobox", role="listbox", role="option", and aria-selected; these attributes promote accessibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  The code appears structured and correct. No obvious patterns raise warnings or errors; assuming proper integration, this should be free of console issues.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  The use of useCallback for event handlers and proper dependency arrays in useEffect suggests that the component is optimized to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
