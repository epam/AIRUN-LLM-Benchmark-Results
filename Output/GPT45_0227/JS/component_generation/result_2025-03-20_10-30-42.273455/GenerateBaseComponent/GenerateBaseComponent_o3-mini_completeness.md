# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component returns a div with class "searchable-select" and conditionally renders the dropdown content when open, ensuring the UI element is rendered.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  The dropdown contains an input element (with class "search-input") used for searching through options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The component accepts a single selected option via props and the onChange callback is invoked with the chosen option, confirming single selection support.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The onKeyDown handler properly intercepts "ArrowUp" and "ArrowDown" keys to update the highlighted index, confirming keyboard navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  Pressing "Enter" either opens the dropdown or, if already open with a highlighted item, selects that item via the handleSelect function.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  The onKeyDown event handler toggles the dropdown visibility when "Enter" is pressed if the dropdown is closed, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  The closeDropdown function calls containerRef.current?.focus(), ensuring that focus returns to the select component upon dropdown closure.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  Each option's onClick handler triggers the handleSelect function, which in turn calls closeDropdown, closing the dropdown after a mouse click.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  Keyboard selection via the Enter key causes handleSelect to fire, which calls closeDropdown, ensuring the dropdown closes upon keyboard selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  The keyDown handler explicitly checks for the "Escape" key and calls closeDropdown, meeting this criterion.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  An event listener on mousedown detects clicks outside the component, triggering closeDropdown to close the dropdown appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  The onKeyDown handler opens the dropdown by setting isOpen to true when "Enter" is pressed while the component is focused.
