# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The application uses axios to fetch character data from 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' and displays the results in a list. The CharacterList component maps through the characters array and renders each character's name in a list item.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The application includes a loading state that displays "Loading characters..." while the API request is in progress. The loading state is properly managed with a useState hook and set to false when the request is complete.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The application iterates through all characters in the `characters` array using `characters.map()` and renders each one as a list item. All fetched characters will be displayed in the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  The provided code does not include any search functionality or user input fields. It's a simple display of Star Wars characters fetched from the API.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character is displayed with its name in a list item: `<li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>`. The character name is correctly accessed from the character object.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The project structure and configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json) match the typical Create React App setup. The package.json includes react-scripts which is the core of Create React App.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The application properly manages three states:
  - `characters` for storing the fetched data
  - `loading` for tracking the loading status
  - `error` for storing any error messages
  
  These states are managed with the useState hook and updated appropriately during the API call lifecycle.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each list item has a unique key based on the character's URL: `<li key={character.url}>`. This ensures that React can efficiently update the DOM when the list changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  If no characters are fetched (empty array), the application will simply render an empty unordered list. While not explicitly handling an "empty state" with a special message, this behavior is acceptable as the list will be empty when there's no data, and the application includes separate handling for loading and error states.
