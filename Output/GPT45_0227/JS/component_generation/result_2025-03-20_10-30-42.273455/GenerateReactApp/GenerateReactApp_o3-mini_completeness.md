# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The CharacterList component makes an API call to "https://swapi.dev/api/people" and maps the results to display a list of character names.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The code conditionally renders a "Loading characters..." message while data is being fetched.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  After the API call completes successfully, all character entries from data.results are rendered within an unordered list.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  The provided implementation does not include any search functionality or input fields; it simply fetches and displays data.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each list item uses the characterâ€™s name for display, and the key prop (character.url) ensures efficient rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The project structure, including files like package.json, tsconfig.json, and the use of react-scripts, is consistent with a Create React App setup.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The use of useState to manage loading, error, and character data states in the CharacterList component ensures proper state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  Unique keys are provided for each character using character.url, which is a suitable unique identifier.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  The application will render an empty unordered list when there are no characters, which is acceptable. However, it does not display a specific message to notify the user of an empty data state. This absence results in a slightly lower confidence level in fully meeting the requirement, though it is still considered a proper handling of the state.
