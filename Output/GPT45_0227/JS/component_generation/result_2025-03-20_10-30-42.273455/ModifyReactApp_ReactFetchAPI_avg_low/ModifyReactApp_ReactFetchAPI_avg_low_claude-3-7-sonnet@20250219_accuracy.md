# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type
  
  The search input field correctly updates the `searchQuery` state via `setSearchQuery` in the `handleSearchChange` function.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls
  
  The code implements debouncing using `lodash.debounce` with a 500ms delay, which is within the required 300-500ms range.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured
  
  Axios is imported and used for API requests, with proper configuration including parameters for search.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses
  
  The code uses TypeScript typing throughout, including interfaces for `Character` and `ApiResponse`, and type annotations for all state variables and function parameters.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters
  
  The API endpoint `https://swapi.dev/api/people` is correctly constructed with search parameters using axios's params option.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate
  
  The code uses both `useMemo` for the debounced function and `useCallback` for the fetch function and event handler, which is appropriate for performance optimization.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback
  
  Error handling is implemented using try-catch block in the `fetchCharacters` function, with appropriate user feedback displayed in the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing
  
  API calls are debounced with `lodash.debounce`, ensuring they are triggered only after the user stops typing for 500ms.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices
  
  State management uses React hooks appropriately and follows best practices, including separate state variables for characters, loading, search query, and error.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code
  
  The code is clean without unused imports or commented-out code. There is one `console.error` for logging errors, which is appropriate for error tracking.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests
  
  Loading state is managed properly with `setLoading(true)` before API calls and `setLoading(false)` in the finally block, ensuring it's always updated correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns
  
  The component uses functional components with hooks which aligns with React 18.x patterns and best practices.
