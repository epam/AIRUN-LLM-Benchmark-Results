# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name
    
    The implementation includes a search input field with the placeholder "Search characters..." that filters characters by name. The input is controlled by the `searchQuery` state and uses the `onChange` handler to trigger a debounced API call that filters characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests
    
    The implementation includes a loading indicator that displays "Loading..." when the `loading` state is true. This state is set to true at the beginning of API requests and set to false upon completion.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query
    
    The implementation uses the `useEffect` hook to call `fetchCharacters('')` when the component mounts, which loads all characters initially with an empty search query.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type
    
    The implementation uses a debounced search function (`debouncedFetchCharacters`) that updates the search results as the user types. The debounce delay is set to 500ms to prevent excessive API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found
    
    The implementation displays "No characters found." when the API request completes (`!loading`), there's no error (`!error`), and the characters array is empty (`characters.length === 0`).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design
    
    The implementation includes responsive design elements like using percentage-based widths, box-sizing: border-box, and a max-width container with centered margins, ensuring the component will adapt to different screen sizes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response
    
    The implementation renders a list of characters when `!loading && characters.length > 0`, displaying each character's name in a list item. Each item is correctly keyed using the character's URL.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed
    
    The implementation includes error handling in the API call with try/catch blocks, setting an error state when the API request fails, and displaying a user-friendly error message when appropriate.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props
    
    The implementation defines TypeScript interfaces for Character and ApiResponse, and properly types all state variables, function parameters, and component props, including React.FC type for the component itself.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities
    
    The implementation preserves the core functionality of displaying Star Wars characters while adding search capabilities. It continues to use axios for API requests, handles loading and error states, and displays the character list in the same format.
