# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type  
  The input element is controlled by the state variable "searchQuery" and is updated via the onChange handler "handleSearchChange".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls  
  The implementation uses lodash.debounce with a delay of 500ms to debounce API calls, which is within the required range.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured  
  Axios is imported and used in the fetchCharacters function to perform a GET request to the API endpoint with appropriate query parameters.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses  
  Proper TypeScript interfaces ("Character" and "ApiResponse") are used, and the component is typed as React.FC. Function parameters and return values are adequately typed.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters  
  The API endpoint "https://swapi.dev/api/people" is used with the "search" parameter correctly passed via axios' params option.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate  
  useCallback is used for defining fetchCharacters and handleSearchChange functions, and useMemo is properly applied to memoize the debouncedFetchCharacters function.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback  
  The try/catch block in fetchCharacters handles errors by logging the error and setting an error message state which is then displayed to the user.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing  
  The use of lodash.debounce ensures that the API call is made only after the user stops typing for 500ms.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices  
  The code utilizes React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, and useMemo) effectively for state management and side effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code  
  All imported modules (React, axios, debounce, hooks) are used, and there are no commented-out lines or redundant code segments.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests  
  The "loading" state is set to true before initiating the API call and properly reset to false in the finally block to indicate the loading state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns  
  The component adheres to modern React practices by using function components with hooks and performance optimizations and is compatible with React 18.x.
