# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the documentation identifies all major components (REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, pageCtrl)
  
  The documentation clearly identifies and discusses the main components including REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and pageCtrl in the Component Architecture section. However, I'm not 100% confident as there could potentially be other components in the original application that weren't fully documented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the purpose of the REST factory for API communication
  
  The documentation clearly explains that the REST factory handles communication with backend RESTful APIs and uses Angular's $resource service for this purpose.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm the documentation describes all API endpoints exposed in the REST factory
  
  The documentation mentions several API endpoints like `api/content/:contentID`, `api/content/:contentID/tags`, etc., but I cannot be certain that it covers all endpoints without seeing the original code. The documentation provides a general overview of the endpoints but may not be exhaustive.

  The documentation clearly describes local storage integration for temporary storage of unsaved changes to prevent data loss in multiple sections.

- **Fail** (70%): Validate the documentation explains the version comparison functionality
  
  While the documentation mentions "compare versions" as an action button and talks about content revisioning for rollback and comparison, it does not provide detailed explanation of how the version comparison functionality works. There is a lack of specific information about the comparison interface, diff visualization, or the technical implementation of this feature.

  The documentation provides a detailed step-by-step workflow for creating a new page under "Expected User Workflows and Interactions."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page editing workflow
  
  The documentation clearly explains the page editing workflow under "Expected User Workflows and Interactions."

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the documentation describes the page duplication feature
  
  The documentation mentions page duplication as one of the available actions in the Main Functionality and Features section and refers to duplicate in the Action Buttons section, but it doesn't provide a detailed workflow for duplication specifically.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains the page deletion process
  
  The documentation clearly explains the page deletion process under "Expected User Workflows and Interactions."

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the auto-URL generation from title feature
