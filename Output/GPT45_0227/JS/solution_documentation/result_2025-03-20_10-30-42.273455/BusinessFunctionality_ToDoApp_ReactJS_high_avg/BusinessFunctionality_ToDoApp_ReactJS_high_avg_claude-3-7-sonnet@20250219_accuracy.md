# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document identifies the application as a Todo list management application
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the component structure (TodoApp, TodoItem, TodoFooter)
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of local storage for data persistence
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the state management approach using the TodoModel
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the routing mechanism for filtering todos
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the event handling for user interactions
- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of immutable data structures for state management
  
  The document mentions "Immutable data structures preferred for predictable state management" and references "Immutable data structures and functional programming patterns" for performance optimization, but it doesn't provide specific implementation details about how immutability is enforced in the codebase. This makes it difficult to verify if the application is using explicit immutable data structures (like Immutable.js) or just following immutable patterns with standard JavaScript objects.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the performance optimization using shouldComponentUpdate
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of the Utils class for helper functions
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the data flow between components
