### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Pass**: Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.
   - All imports are used in the provided code.

2. **Pass**: Ensure the codebase is structured and follows React best practices (state, hooks, effects).
   - The codebase is well-structured and follows React best practices, including the use of hooks and effects.

3. **Pass**: Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.
   - The use of hooks and state management appears to be appropriate, minimizing unnecessary re-renders.

4. **Pass**: Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.
   - The code uses modern React and TypeScript features, indicating compatibility with the latest versions.

5. **Pass**: Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.
   - There are no apparent issues that would cause console errors or warnings.

6. **Pass**: Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.
   - The app uses React state to manage form values, avoiding direct DOM access.

7. **Pass**: Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React virtual DOM.
   - There is no direct DOM manipulation outside of React's virtual DOM.

8. **Pass**: Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React state and props.
   - The app does not overuse refs and relies on state and props for managing data.

9. **Pass**: Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.
   - The state management appears to be efficient, avoiding excessive re-renders.

10. **Pass**: Ensure the code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility.
    - The code is decomposed into components with clear single responsibilities.

11. **Pass**: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
    - The code follows DRY principles and does not contain unnecessary duplicates.

12. **Pass**: App does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.
    - This is confirmed as the app uses React state for form values.

13. **Pass**: App has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.
    - The provided code maintains a consistent DOM tree structure.

14. **Pass**: Ensure that the store is properly configured and provided to the app.
    - The store configuration and provision appear to be correct.

15. **Pass**: Verify that the code is migrated to React 18.x.
    - The code uses modern React features, indicating it is compatible with React 18.x.

16. **Pass**: Check that TypeScript is used in the translated code.
    - TypeScript is used throughout the codebase.

17. **Pass**: Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for managing local data.
    - Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for state management.

18. **Pass**: Ensure that the code is split into separate components.
    - The code is appropriately split into separate components.

19. **Pass**: Validate that the code does not contain any TODOs.
    - There are no TODOs present in the code.

20. **Pass**: Check that the code is optimized.
    - The code appears to be optimized and follows best practices.
