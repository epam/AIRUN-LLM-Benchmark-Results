# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Confirm that the state slices for page and user are correctly defined and managed.
- **Pass**: The `pageSlice` and `userSlice` are correctly defined using `createSlice` from `@reduxjs/toolkit`. The initial states are properly set, and reducers for setting and resetting the state are correctly implemented.

### Step 2: Verify that API service functions are correctly defined and used.
- **Pass**: The `restApi` object is correctly defined with various methods for handling API requests using `axios`. The methods cover CRUD operations for blocks, content, content extras, content tags, and content revisions.

### Step 3: Ensure that the application correctly handles all the functionalities from the original Angular code.
- **Pass**: The `PageEditor` component handles functionalities such as setting the page type, title, description, tags, URL, and publish status. It also manages tag suggestions and auto-generates URLs based on the title.

### Step 4: Verify that all functionalities like save, delete, update, and tag management are working correctly.
- **Pass**: The `PageEditor` component includes methods for handling tag changes and selecting tag suggestions. The `restApi` methods for querying tags are used correctly to fetch suggestions.

### Step 5: Ensure that the application performs all CRUD operations correctly.
- **Pass**: The `restApi` object includes methods for performing CRUD operations on blocks, content, content extras, content tags, and content revisions. These methods are used appropriately in the `PageEditor` component.

### Step 6: Verify that the application handles local storage and state persistence correctly.
- **Fail**: There is no evidence in the provided code that local storage or state persistence is being handled. The application should include mechanisms to save and load state from local storage or another persistence layer.
