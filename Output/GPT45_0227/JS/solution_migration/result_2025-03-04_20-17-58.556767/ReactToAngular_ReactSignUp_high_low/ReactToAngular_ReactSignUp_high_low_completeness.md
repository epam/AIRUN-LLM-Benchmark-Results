1. **Verify that all React components and their functionalities are correctly translated into Angular components.**
   - **Pass**: The provided code includes Angular components (`SignupComponent`, `FormGroupComponent`, `IconComponent`) that correspond to the functionalities described.

2. **Ensure that the form validation logic is implemented using Angular reactive forms.**
   - **Pass**: The `signupForm` is created using Angular's `FormBuilder` with appropriate validators.

3. **Check that the application includes the necessary form controls and validation rules.**
   - **Pass**: The form controls for `name`, `email`, and `password` are included with the necessary validation rules.

4. **Confirm that the application correctly binds the form controls and handles form submission.**
   - **Pass**: The form controls are correctly bound using `[formGroup]` and `(ngSubmit)` in the template. The `submit` method handles form submission.

5. **Ensure the application correctly displays form validation errors.**

7. **Ensure that the auth.effects.ts file correctly handles side effects using @ngrx/effects, including calling the API and dispatching success or failure actions.**
   - **Fail**: The provided code does not include an `auth.effects.ts` file or any effects handling side effects using `@ngrx/effects`.

8. **Validate that the API call to signup is correctly integrated and that the response is handled properly.**
   - **Pass**: The `ApiService` includes the `signup` method, and the `submit` method in `SignupComponent` handles the response correctly.

9. **Confirm that the application navigates to the login page correctly when the link is clicked.**
   - **Pass**: The template includes a link with `routerLink="/login"` to navigate to the login page.
