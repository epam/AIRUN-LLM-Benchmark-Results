# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
- **Pass**: The `App.tsx` file contains an input field with the class `new-todo`. The `handleAddTodo` function handles the `Enter` key press event, dispatches the `addTodo` action with the value from the state, and clears the input field.

### Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
- **Pass**: The `App.tsx` file filters the todos based on the current filter state (`all`, `active`, `completed`) and passes the filtered todos to the `TodoList` component, which displays them.

### Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
- **Pass**: The `App.tsx` file includes a checkbox with the id `toggle-all` that, when changed, dispatches the `toggleAll` action with the checked status.

### Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItem.tsx` file includes functionality to toggle the completion status, edit the title, and delete the todo item. The `toggleTodo`, `editTodo`, and `deleteTodo` actions are dispatched accordingly.

### Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItem.tsx` file handles double-click to start editing, `Enter` key to submit changes, and `Escape` key to reset the editing state to the initial value.

### Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
- **Pass**: The `Footer.tsx` file displays the count of active items, provides filter buttons to set the current filter, and includes a button to clear completed items.

### Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
- **Pass**: The `Footer.tsx` file includes a button with the class `clear-completed` that, when clicked, dispatches the `clearCompleted` action.
