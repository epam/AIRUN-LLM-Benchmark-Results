# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components
  
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately
  
- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation
  
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization
  
- **Fail** (90%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization
  
  While the migration plan mentions code splitting with React.lazy and Suspense in the "Next Steps" section, the actual implementation examples do not include code splitting. The answer acknowledges this as a future step but doesn't provide an example implementation.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations
  
  The sample code doesn't include any instances of React.memo being used for component optimization. It's only mentioned in the "Next Steps" section as something to implement in the future.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks
  
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models
  
- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks
