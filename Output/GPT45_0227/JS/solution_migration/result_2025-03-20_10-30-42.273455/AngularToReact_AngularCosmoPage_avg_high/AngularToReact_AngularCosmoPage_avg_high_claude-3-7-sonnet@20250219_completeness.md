# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented

    The provided migration plan shows API endpoints for getting, updating, deleting, and saving content in the `contentApi.ts` file, but the implementation for duplicate functionality is missing. While the `fetchPage` async thunk for getting content is present in the Redux slice, the corresponding implementation for create, update, and duplicate operations is not shown in the code examples provided.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present

    There is no implementation or mention of page type selection functionality in the provided code. The PageForm component only shows title and description fields, with no reference to page type selection.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists

    The provided code does not include or mention any URL auto-generation functionality based on the title. This feature is completely absent from the implementation examples.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented

    While there are API endpoints for getting and saving content tags in the `contentApi.ts` file, there is no implementation of tag management UI components with autocomplete suggestions in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available

    The code provided does not include any implementation or mention of publish status options. The PageForm component only shows basic title and description fields without publish status controls.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented

    There is no implementation or mention of scheduled publishing date functionality in the provided code examples.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present

    While a `useLocalStorage` hook is provided, it only offers basic storage and retrieval functionality. There is no implementation of version comparison or restoration features as required.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented

    The provided code examples do not include a notification system for success or error messages. While there is error handling in the Redux slice, there's no UI implementation to display these messages to users.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present

    The PageForm component shows minimal input validation (just a "required" attribute on the title input), but comprehensive form validation for URL and page type fields is not implemented.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled

    The provided API implementation in `contentApi.ts` shows some basic endpoints but doesn't demonstrate that all endpoints from the original code are properly handled. The comment "// ... other endpoints" suggests incompleteness.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented

    There is no implementation or mention of extras management functionality in the provided code examples, despite the Page model including a PageExtra type reference.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained

    There is no implementation or mention of revision history functionality in the provided code examples.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components

    The provided project structure clearly shows separation of concerns with feature folders (like features/page), UI components in the components folder, and business logic in slices and API files, following best practices for React application architecture.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved

    The code includes i18next setup in the i18n folder with translation files and configuration. However, there are no actual examples of using translations in components (with useTranslation hook or Trans component), which is why this is not 100% confidence.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters

    The routing setup in AppRoutes.tsx shows routes with path parameters similar to what would be expected (/page/:contentID and /new). However, without seeing the original URL structure for comparison, I cannot be 100% confident that all original URL structures and parameters are maintained.
