# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props  
  All provided files use TypeScript (.ts and .tsx extensions) and declare props/interfaces where appropriate. The code consistently applies TypeScript’s type system.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management  
  The code in features/page/pageSlice.ts clearly uses createSlice and createAsyncThunk from Redux Toolkit to manage state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components  
  All React components (PageEditor, PageForm, AppRoutes, etc.) are implemented as functional components.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately  
  The examples correctly utilize useState and useEffect. Although useCallback and useMemo are not explicitly used, they are not necessary in every scenario. Their absence doesn’t indicate misuse, so overall the hook usage is appropriate.  
  (Note: Less than 100% because the examples do not demonstrate useCallback/useMemo even though they are mentioned as optimization steps when needed.)

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource  
  The API examples use axios for communication, which conforms to the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components  
  The PageForm component manages its state using useState and appropriately handles form inputs as controlled components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation  
  The routing is properly implemented in AppRoutes.tsx using Routes and Route from react-router-dom, and PageEditor utilizes useParams for route parameters.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization  
  The i18next library (in combination with react-i18next) is correctly used for setting up internationalization.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization  
  There is no explicit demonstration of code splitting (e.g., usage of React.lazy or Suspense) in the provided examples. It is only mentioned as a next step.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations  
  The examples do not showcase any use of React.memo to optimize rendering of expensive components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks  
  Both the PageEditor and PageForm components include appropriate dependency arrays in their useEffect hooks (e.g., [contentID, dispatch] and [page]).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models  
  The models (e.g., Page, User) are referenced as TypeScript interfaces, and their usage indicates that the data models are strictly typed.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state  
  The code demonstrates Redux selectors (selectCurrentPage, selectPageLoading) for accessing state in PageEditor.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations  
  The use of setPage and fetchPage (via createAsyncThunk) shows that proper action creators are in place.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks  
  The custom hook useLocalStorage.ts clearly demonstrates the proper implementation of local storage functionality using useState and useEffect.
