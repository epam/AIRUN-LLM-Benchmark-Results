# Evaluation Report

1. **Fail** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented.  
   Explanation: The provided code shows a mechanism for fetching and updating a page via the Redux slice and a form for editing (update) a page, but it does not include clear implementations for creating a new page, deleting an existing one, or duplicating a page.

2. **Fail** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present.  
   Explanation: There is no evidence in the code of any interface element or logic to allow selecting or switching a page type. The sample only covers editing title and description.

3. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists.  
   Explanation: The answer does not include any functionality that takes a title input and automatically generates a URL slug or similar identifier.

4. **Fail** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented.  
   Explanation: Although the API provides endpoints for content tags, no UI component or logic for autocomplete or tag management is demonstrated in the answer.

5. **Fail** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available.  
   Explanation: The implementation does not show any option or control for setting different publish statuses; it only covers basic page editing tasks.

6. **Fail** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented.  
   Explanation: There is no handling or UI for scheduling a future publish date in the provided code.

7. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present.  
   Explanation: Although a simple local storage hook is implemented, it only handles storage and retrieval of values without any functionality around version comparison or restoration.

8. **Fail** (100%): Validate that a notification system for success/error messages is implemented.  
   Explanation: No notification components or mechanisms to display success or error messages to the user are present in the code.

9. **Fail** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present.  
   Explanation: The form in the PageForm component only demonstrates basic input handling (e.g., a required attribute on the title) and does not include validations for URL or page type as required by the evaluation criteria.

10. **Fail** (90%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled.  
    Explanation: While the API layer (contentApi) defines several endpoints (getContent, updateContent, deleteContent, saveContent, getContentTags, saveContentTags), it does not cover all endpoints mentioned in the requirements, such as those for duplication or extras. The 90% confidence reflects the possibility that additional endpoints may exist in the original specification, which are not fully addressed in the sample.

11. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented.  
    Explanation: There is no provided code for managing additional features or “extras” that might be part of the original AngularJS application.

12. **Fail** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained.  
    Explanation: The answer omits any implementation related to tracking or restoring revision history for page changes.

13. **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components.  
    Explanation: The proposed project structure clearly segregates API calls, Redux slices (business logic) and UI components into distinct folders, which meets the requirement.

14. **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved.  
    Explanation: The implementation includes an i18next configuration along with translation resource files (e.g., en.json), which successfully preserves translation functionality.

15. **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters.  
    Explanation: The React Router configuration shows the use of paths like "/page/:contentID" and "/new", which suggest an attempt to mirror the original URL structure. However, given the limited context on the AngularJS routing specifics, the assessment is made with 90% confidence.
