# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling
  
  The code clearly uses Reactive Forms with FormBuilder, FormGroup, and various validators imported from '@angular/forms'. The form is initialized in ngOnInit() with the FormBuilder.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)
  
  The signup form implements these validations correctly:
  - Name: `[Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3), Validators.maxLength(60)]`
  - Email: `[Validators.required, Validators.email]`
  - Password: `[Validators.required, Validators.minLength(6)]`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use
  
  The component includes two custom async validators (`nameExistsValidator()` and `emailExistsValidator()`) that make API calls to check if the name or email already exists.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched
  
  The FormGroupComponent applies CSS classes 'has-error' and 'has-success' based on the control's state, and the template uses `[ngClass]` to conditionally apply these styles.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions
  
  The `onSubmit()` method calls the API service's signup method and dispatches the `AuthActions.signupComplete` action upon success.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails
  
  Error messages appear in a span with the help-block class when the control is invalid, and the FormGroupComponent provides appropriate error messages for different validation failures.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service
  
  There is no evidence of the Title service being used in the provided code. The Title service should be imported from '@angular/platform-browser' and used to set the document title.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management
  
  The code imports Store from '@ngrx/store' and dispatches actions through it. EffectsModule is also imported in the app.module.ts.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress
  
  The submit button has a `[disabled]="submitting || signupForm.invalid"` attribute that disables it during form submission.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses
  
  The signup method uses the subscribe method with next and error handlers, appropriately navigating on success and setting submitting to false on error.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management
  
  The component implements OnInit correctly, uses dependency injection properly, and follows standard Angular component structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises
  
  The ApiService correctly uses HttpClient for API calls, returning Observables rather than Promises.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements
  
  The FormGroupComponent provides detailed error messages for each validation error type, including custom messages for nameExists and emailExists validators.
