- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component includes all three required form fields: name, email, and password
  
  The signup component clearly includes all three required form fields in the FormGroup creation:
  ```typescript
  this.signupForm = this.fb.group({
    name: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3), Validators.maxLength(60)], [this.nameExistsValidator()]],
    email: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.email], [this.emailExistsValidator()]],
    password: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.minLength(6)]]
  });
  ```
  These fields are also rendered in the HTML template using the `app-form-group` component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page includes a heading 'Join PodBaby today.'
  
  The heading is present in the HTML template:
  ```html
  <h2>Join PodBaby today.</h2>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a lead paragraph about membership benefits
  
  The lead paragraph is included in the HTML template:
  ```html
  <p class="lead">
    As a member you can subscribe to podcast feeds and keep track of your favorite episodes.
  </p>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form includes a submit button with appropriate styling and icon
  
  The submit button is properly implemented with Bootstrap styling and an icon:
  ```html
  <button class="btn btn-primary form-control" type="submit" [disabled]="submitting || signupForm.invalid">
    <app-icon icon="sign-in"></app-icon> Signup
  </button>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a link to the login page with appropriate text
  
  The link to the login page is included:
  ```html
  <p><a routerLink="/login">Already a member? Log in here.</a></p>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the FormGroup component or equivalent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display
  
  The FormGroup component is properly implemented with error handling and styling capabilities. It accepts the form control, placeholder, and input type as inputs and provides error messages based on validation errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Icon component or equivalent is implemented for the signup button
  
  The Icon component is implemented and used in the signup button:
  ```typescript
  @Component({
    selector: 'app-icon',
    template: `<i class="fa fa-{{icon}}"></i>`
  })
  export class IconComponent {
    @Input() icon: string;
  }
  ```

  - Email: required, email format
  - Password: required, min length 6

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure asynchronous validation for both name and email uniqueness is implemented
  
  Asynchronous validation for both name and email uniqueness is properly implemented using AsyncValidatorFn and the API service:
  ```typescript
  nameExistsValidator(): AsyncValidatorFn {
    // Implementation that checks if name exists
  }

  emailExistsValidator(): AsyncValidatorFn {
    // Implementation that checks if email exists
  }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API integration is complete with proper error handling
  
  The signup API integration is implemented with proper error handling:
  ```typescript
  onSubmit(): void {
    if (this.signupForm.invalid) return;
    this.submitting = true;
    const { name, email, password } = this.signupForm.value;
    this.apiService.signup(name, email, password).subscribe({
      next: result => {
        this.store.dispatch(AuthActions.signupComplete({ user: result.data }));
        this.router.navigate(['/']);
      },
      error: () => {
        this.submitting = false;
      }
    });
  }
