# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The SignupComponent uses FormBuilder and FormGroup from Angular's Reactive Forms module to construct the form.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The component defines synchronous validators for the 'name' (Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3), Validators.maxLength(60)), 'email' (Validators.required, Validators.email), and 'password' (Validators.required, Validators.minLength(6)) fields.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  Asynchronous validators (nameExistsValidator and emailExistsValidator) call the ApiService methods to check if the name or email already exists. However, these validators use control.valueChanges within the async validator, which is a slightly unusual pattern and could lead to unexpected behavior in some cases. Thus, the confidence is 90%.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The FormGroupComponent template applies 'has-error' and 'has-success' classes based on the touched and validity state of the control, ensuring proper visual feedback.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  The onSubmit() method checks form validity, calls the ApiService.signup method, dispatches the signupComplete action upon a successful response, and navigates to the home page.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The FormGroupComponent template displays an error message span when the control is invalid, using the errorMessage getter to determine the message.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  There is no usage of Angular's Title service in the SignupComponent, so the page title is not managed as required.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The component imports @ngrx/store, dispatches actions via AuthActions, and the AppModule includes both StoreModule and EffectsModule, confirming the usage of NgRx for state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button in the signup template is disabled when either 'submitting' is true or the form is invalid, ensuring that multiple submissions do not occur during processing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  The API call in onSubmit() correctly dispatches an action and navigates on success, and resets the 'submitting' flag on error.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component follows best practices by separating template, styles, and logic, and properly implements the OnInit lifecycle hook.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The ApiService correctly uses Angular's HttpClient to make HTTP GET and POST requests, returning observables.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The error messages provided in FormGroupComponent (e.g., "This field is required", "Minimum length is ...", "A valid email address is required", etc.) align with common validation feedback. However, the exact wording may differ slightly from the specification if there were any hard requirements, so confidence is set at 90%.
