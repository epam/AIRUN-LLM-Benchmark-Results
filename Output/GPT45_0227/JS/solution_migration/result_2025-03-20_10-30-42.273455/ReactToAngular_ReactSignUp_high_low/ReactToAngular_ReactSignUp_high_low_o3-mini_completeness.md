# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component includes all three required form fields: name, email, and password  
  The component sets up the form group with controls for "name", "email", and "password", and the template includes corresponding <app-form-group> tags.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page includes a heading 'Join PodBaby today.'  
  The template contains an <h2> element with the exact text "Join PodBaby today."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a lead paragraph about membership benefits  
  A <p class="lead"> element explains the membership benefits (subscription to podcast feeds and episode tracking).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form includes a submit button with appropriate styling and icon  
  The form has a button styled with classes "btn btn-primary form-control" that includes an <app-icon> component, indicating correct implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a link to the login page with appropriate text  
  The template includes an anchor tag (<a routerLink="/login">) with text "Already a member? Log in here."

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the FormGroup component or equivalent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display  
  The provided FormGroupComponent handles error display and applies conditional CSS classes based on the controlâ€™s validity.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Icon component or equivalent is implemented for the signup button  
  The IconComponent is implemented, rendering an icon using the provided "icon" input.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all validation rules are implemented (name length, email format, password length)  
  The validators enforce requirements: name has required, minlength(3), maxlength(60); email has required and proper email format; and password has required and minlength(6).

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure asynchronous validation for both name and email uniqueness is implemented  
  Async validators (nameExistsValidator and emailExistsValidator) are provided and use RxJS operators to debounce and validate uniqueness.  
  While they implement the asynchronous validation logic, using control.valueChanges within the validator is unconventional. This might lead to multiple subscriptions and unexpected behavior in some cases, so confidence is slightly less than 100%.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API integration is complete with proper error handling  
  The onSubmit method calls the signup API, dispatches an NgRx action on success, navigates to the home page, and on error resets the submitting flag.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the form layout matches the horizontal form structure specified  
  The provided template lacks any clear horizontal layout structure (such as explicit row or column classes) that one might expect from a horizontal form, and it appears to be arranged vertically in a container.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page has proper document title setting functionality  
  There is no implementation for setting the document title in the provided code, which is required by the evaluation criteria.
