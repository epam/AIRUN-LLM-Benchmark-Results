# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
- **Fail** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators

    The provided solution does not explicitly show how React refs are replaced with Angular's @ViewChild decorator. While the solution covers many aspects of migration, it does not include specific examples of converting React's useRef() to Angular's @ViewChild or @ViewChildren decorators.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
- **Fail** (90%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic

    The solution primarily focuses on NgRx for state management but doesn't clearly demonstrate the use of dedicated Angular services for data handling and business logic beyond the effects. While there is an implicit understanding that services would be used, explicit examples of service creation and implementation for business logic are missing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs
- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules

    While the solution mentions lazy loading in Step 8 as a recommendation ("Lazy-load feature modules if the app grows"), it does not provide specific implementation details or code examples for how to set up lazy loading in Angular. The answer acknowledges the concept but doesn't demonstrate implementation.
