# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items

    The answer provides code snippets for setting up NgRx store with selectors for todos, but it doesn't include the actual implementation that displays the todo items in a template. While there is code for the TodoItemComponent, there's no TodoListComponent implementation showing how all items are displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented

    The answer includes the addTodo action and corresponding reducer logic that handles adding a new todo with a unique ID.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works

    The answer includes the toggleTodo action and corresponding reducer logic that handles toggling a todo's completed status, as well as the TodoItemComponent's toggle event emitter.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented

    The answer includes the editTodo action, reducer logic, and the TodoItemComponent with editing functionality including start/finish edit methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented

    The answer includes the deleteTodo action, corresponding reducer logic, and the delete event emitter in the TodoItemComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented

    The answer includes the toggleAll action and corresponding reducer logic that marks all todos as complete or incomplete.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works

    The answer includes selectors for all, active, and completed todos, and routing setup for filters. However, it doesn't show the complete implementation of how these filters are used in the template, which is why I'm not 100% confident.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items

    The answer mentions a TodoFooterComponent but doesn't provide its implementation showing how it displays the count of active items.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items

    The answer includes the clearCompleted action and corresponding reducer logic that filters out completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage

    The answer includes an effect that saves todos to localStorage whenever the todo list changes, and the initial state loads from localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation

    The answer includes routing setup with paths for '' and ':filter', which would support URLs like '/active', '/completed', etc., matching typical TodoMVC URL structures.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states

    The answer doesn't address UI handling for empty states (when there are no todos).

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly

    The TodoItemComponent shows form handling for editing todos. There's also an addTodo action, but the exact form submission for adding new todos isn't completely shown, which is why I'm not 100% confident.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships

    The answer outlines component structure (TodoAppComponent, TodoListComponent, TodoItemComponent, etc.) and shows input/output bindings in the TodoItemComponent, indicating proper component relationships. However, without seeing the full implementation of all components, I'm not 100% confident.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved

    The answer covers key todo functionality (adding, toggling, editing, deleting, filtering, etc.) but without seeing the original application's complete business logic, I cannot be 100% certain all edge cases are handled.
