# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The answer explicitly states that the migration is for Angular 14.x and demonstrates project setup commands (ng new…). This meets the criterion.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The answer includes installation and usage of @ngrx/store, as well as proper NgRx patterns in actions, reducers, and selectors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  The guide provides an example of Effects (TodoEffects) to manage side effects such as persisting data to localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  All three elements—actions, reducers, and selectors—are well represented and correctly implemented in the answer.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  The provided TodoItemComponent clearly uses the @Component decorator along with @Input and @Output for property and event binding.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  The answer does not show any instance of replacing React refs with Angular’s @ViewChild. This criterion is not addressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  The example component demonstrates proper usage of @Input and @Output for communication.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  While the answer provides an example of Angular Effects for localStorage persistence, it does not include a dedicated Angular service for data handling or business logic. This omission makes it unclear whether the service pattern is fully applied. If the business logic were encapsulated in a service, it would meet the requirement. Hence, this is marked as a failure with a slight reservation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  The examples (e.g., constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) {…} and the Effects class constructor) demonstrate proper use of Angular’s dependency injection.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  The TodoItemComponent uses ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush, which is an appropriate application of Angular’s change detection strategy.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  The answer includes setting up Angular Router with defined routes and demonstrates subscribing to route parameters.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The file structure and code organization appear to adhere to common Angular style guidelines. However, some minor details (like a more explicit module-based lazy-loading implementation) could improve adherence, so confidence is slightly less than 100%.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  The answer defines interfaces (such as Todo) and types correctly, showing sound use of TypeScript throughout the migration guide.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  Angular HTML templates are provided for components, replacing what would have been JSX in React.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  Event handling in the Angular components is handled using Angular’s event binding syntax (e.g., (change), (dblclick), (blur), (keydown.enter)).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  The provided code and guide do not include any leftover TODO comments.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  Although the guide mentions lazy-loading as a best practice (“Lazy-load feature modules if the app grows”), it does not include an implementation example or details on how to set it up, leading to an unfulfilled requirement.
