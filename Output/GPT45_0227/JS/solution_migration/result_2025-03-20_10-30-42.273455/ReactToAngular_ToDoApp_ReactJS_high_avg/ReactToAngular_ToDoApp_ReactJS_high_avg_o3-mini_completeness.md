# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The guide defines selectors (e.g., selectAllTodos) and instructs the creation of components (such as TodoListComponent and TodoItemComponent) that imply the display of all todo items. However, the code that explicitly renders a list is not shown. Overall, it provides a clear outline, so the step is considered passed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The guide includes an action (addTodo) and mentions a TodoInputComponent to implement the addition of new todos, ensuring that adding functionality is covered.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  The reducer includes a toggleTodo action and the TodoItemComponent emits a toggle event on checkbox change, which suffices to confirm the implementation of this feature.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent includes methods (startEdit and finishEdit) that handle editing, along with an editTodo action in the reducer. This confirms that editing functionality is addressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  The guide provides a deleteTodo action and shows that the TodoItemComponent emits a delete event when the destroy button is clicked, ensuring deletion functionality.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  A toggleAll action is present in the reducer, indicating that marking all todos as complete (or incomplete) is supported. Although the UI integration for this feature is not explicitly illustrated in component code, its presence in state management suggests proper implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  The migration guide defines selectors for all, active, and completed todos and integrates Angular routing (using route params) to apply filters, which correctly addresses filtering functionality.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The guide suggests splitting the UI into components (including a TodoFooterComponent), and while the actual implementation of displaying the count is not shown in code, it is implied as a requirement in the structure. This reasoning leads to a pass with a minor confidence deduction due to the lack of explicit code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The clearCompleted action is defined and implemented in the reducer. This confirms that the functionality to remove completed items is provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  An NgRx effect is included that listens to various todo actions and saves the current state of todos to local storage, ensuring persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The Angular routing setup in the guide shows that the application handles URL parameters (using a ':filter' route), maintaining a consistent URL structure akin to the original application.

- **Fail** (80%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  The guide does not provide any explicit detail or code regarding the UI for empty states (e.g., a message for when no todos are present). While the overall structure is present, the lack of an explicit empty state implementation leads to this step being marked as failed. The confidence is at 80% because the comprehensive nature of the guide leaves some room for interpretation that this might be implemented later.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  The provided TodoInput mechanism includes handling (keydown.enter and blur events) that suggests form submission is managed properly. Although not every detail is shown, the implementation approach appears sound.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The guide clearly outlines a modular component-based architecture (with container components and presentational components) that ensures appropriate relationships and separation of concerns among components.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  All key business functionalities (adding, toggling, editing, deleting, marking all complete/incomplete, clearing completed, and filtering) are identified and implemented via actions, reducers, and effects. Some aspects (such as finer UI details) are covered only textually, which leaves a slight uncertainty, hence the 90% confidence.
