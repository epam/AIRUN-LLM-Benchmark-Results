- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS
  
  The code consistently uses ES modules with import/export statements throughout all components, services, and store files. It also explicitly mentions in Step 8: "Remove RequireJS completely, use ES modules (`import/export`)".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management
  
  NgRx store is properly implemented with the installation of dependencies (`npm install @ngrx/store @ngrx/effects @ngrx/store-devtools`) and proper implementation of store structure with actions, reducers, selectors, and effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects
  
  The code includes proper implementation of NgRx effects in `store/effects/todo.effects.ts` with `createEffect()` and appropriate handling of side effects for loading and persisting todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management
  
  The code includes comprehensive action definitions (loadTodos, addTodo, toggleTodo, etc.), a proper reducer with state handling, selectors for various todo states (all, active, completed), and effects for persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator
  
  The TodoStorageService is defined with the `@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })` decorator as per Angular best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service
  
  The TodoStorageService properly implements localStorage for persistence with getTodos() and saveTodos() methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators
  
  While the answer does not show the actual component decorators, it defines a clear component structure and references proper component usage throughout the migration guide.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators
  
  Both TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective properly use the `@Directive({ selector: '[todoFocus]' })` and `@Directive({ selector: '[todoEscape]' })` decorators respectively.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))
  
  The template examples use proper event binding syntax: `(click)="remove.emit(todo.id)"`, `(change)="toggle.emit(todo.id)"`, `(blur)="update.emit(todo)"`, etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])
  
  The template examples use proper property binding syntax: `[class.completed]="todo.completed"`, `[checked]="todo.completed"`, `[todoFocus]="editMode"`.
