# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)
- **Fail** (90%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete

    The provided code doesn't appear to include an explicit action or functionality for marking all todos as complete or incomplete at once. While the NgRx structure is comprehensive for individual todo management (adding, toggling, removing), I don't see a dedicated action like "toggleAll" or similar functionality in the actions or reducer that would handle marking all todos as complete/incomplete simultaneously.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos
- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos

    While the application includes selectors that would support this functionality (selectActiveTodos), the actual display implementation in a component template isn't explicitly shown. However, the structure implies this would be handled in the todo-footer component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo
- **Fail** (70%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original

    There's no explicit information about styling or CSS implementation to maintain the same visual appearance as the original TodoMVC application. While CSS is mentioned in the project setup (`--style=css`), there's no specific code showing how the styling matches the original application.

- **Fail** (80%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately

    The code doesn't explicitly show validation logic for empty todo titles. The addTodo action accepts a title parameter but doesn't show validation to prevent empty titles from being added.

- **Fail** (70%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter

    There's no mention of URL updates or routing configuration based on the selected filter. While there are selectors for different todo states (all, active, completed), there's no code showing how URL would be updated when filters are changed.
