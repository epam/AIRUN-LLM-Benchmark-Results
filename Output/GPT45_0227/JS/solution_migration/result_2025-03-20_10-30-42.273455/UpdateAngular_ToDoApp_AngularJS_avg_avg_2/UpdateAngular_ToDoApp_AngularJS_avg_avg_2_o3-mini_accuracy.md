# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The guide starts with creating a new Angular project using Angular CLI and explicitly refers to Angular 14.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
  The sample code uses ES module syntax (import/export) and instructs to remove RequireJS completely.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
  The provided guide sets up @ngrx/store, includes a reducer, and shows proper setup for state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
  The guide includes an NgRx effect with createEffect and ofType, correctly handling side effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
  A full set of actions, reducers, selectors, and effects for todo management is provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
  The TodoStorageService is decorated with @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }), ensuring it is properly injectable.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
  The TodoStorageService clearly implements getTodos and saveTodos using localStorage.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
  While the guide outlines the component architecture and names components such as todo-header, todo-list, etc., no actual @Component code or decorator is provided. This omission fails to demonstrate the proper use of Angular component decorators.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
  Two directives (todoFocus and todoEscape) are provided with proper use of the @Directive decorator.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
  The example HTML for todo-item.component.html uses Angular template syntax, including *ngIf, and demonstrates usage of Angular binding.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
  The template shows event bindings such as (change), (dblclick), and (click) which are in line with Angular’s event binding practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
  The property binding [class.completed]="todo.completed" in the provided template complies with Angular syntax.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
  The todo-focus directive implements the OnChanges lifecycle hook appropriately. However, no lifecycle hooks are shown in any component code; the available example is limited to a directive. This yields a slight uncertainty regarding the complete application, but the provided usage is correct.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
  The Todo interface is defined in the TodoStorageService, which meets this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
  Dependency injection is used in the service and effects (e.g., injecting TodoStorageService and Store), showing proper practice.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The structure and code provided largely follow Angular’s style guidelines. Although the absence of @Component examples leaves room for improvement, the overall organization suggests adherence to best practices.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
  The code is syntactically correct and appears to follow best practices. However, as this is a static code evaluation without runtime testing, a slight uncertainty remains regarding potential runtime warnings.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
  The usage of TypeScript, including interfaces and type annotations in NgRx actions and reducers, is appropriate.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
  The provided code is clean and free of commented-out code or TODO comments.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design  
  The separation into services, directives, components (as outlined), and NgRx modules indicates adherence to the single responsibility principle.
