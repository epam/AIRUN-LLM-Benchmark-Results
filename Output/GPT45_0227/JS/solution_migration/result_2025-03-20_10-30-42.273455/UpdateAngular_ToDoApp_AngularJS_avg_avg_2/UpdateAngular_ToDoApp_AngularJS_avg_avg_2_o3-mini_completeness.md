# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list  
  The guide clearly organizes a “todo-list” component in the project structure, indicating a dedicated component for displaying todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos  
  The “todo-header” component is designated as the input field for new todos, satisfying this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos  
  The “todo-item” component implements an edit mode (as shown in the HTML snippet with double-click activation), which covers editing functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos  
  The “todo-footer” component is mentioned to handle filters, meeting the requirement for filtering functionality.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics  
  Although an explicit “count” component isn’t separately named, it is common to include the remaining count in the “todo-footer”.  
  Explanation: The guide implies that filtering and clearing actions are handled in the footer; it is assumed that the count statistics would be part of its UI even though it is not detailed explicitly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos  
  The NgRx action “addTodo” is provided, and the directory structure indicates handling of new todo entries.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos  
  The guide includes an “updateTodo” action and an inline editing UI in the “todo-item” component, demonstrating edit functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos  
  The “removeTodo” action is defined, and the UI includes a “destroy” button for deletion.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed  
  The “toggleTodo” action and its corresponding UI (a checkbox) show that marking todos as completed is implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)  
  With the selectors “selectAllTodos”, “selectActiveTodos”, and “selectCompletedTodos,” the guide covers filtering across different statuses.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete  
  There is no action or component behavior specified for toggling all todos at once. Only individual toggling is present.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos  
  The “clearCompleted” action is defined and referenced in the guide, indicating that clearing completed todos is supported.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos  
  Although the UI is split into components and a “todo-footer” is mentioned, the guide does not explicitly include code or a description for displaying the count of remaining todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage  
  The “TodoStorageService” successfully persists todos via localStorage methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization  
  The effect “loadTodos$” uses the storage service to load persisted todos, meeting this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing  
  The “todoEscape” directive listens for the escape key and appropriately emits an event to cancel editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo  
  The “todoFocus” directive is implemented and used to set focus when the todo is in edit mode.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original  
  The guide focuses on migration and architectural changes without detailing CSS or visual styling. No explicit guarantees or code for maintaining the original style are provided.

  There is no validation or handling mechanism described in the guide for empty todo titles during creation or editing.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter  
  The project is initiated with routing disabled (“--routing=false”), and no URL update logic is provided for reflecting the current filter.
