# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all React imports use React 18.x compatible syntax
  
  The code properly imports React 18 components and uses the modern `createRoot` API in `index.tsx` instead of the legacy `ReactDOM.render` method.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all components use functional component syntax with hooks instead of class components
  
  All components in the provided code use functional component syntax with React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Redux Toolkit's createSlice is used for state management
  
  The code correctly implements Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` in `todosSlice.ts` to manage the todo state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for all props, state, and Redux store
  
  Proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for the Redux store (RootState, AppDispatch), todos (ITodo), and the todos state (TodosState).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses immutable state updates in reducers
  
  The code uses Redux Toolkit's `createSlice`, which handles immutable updates automatically.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that nanoid is used for ID generation instead of custom UUID implementation
  
  The code imports and uses `nanoid` for generating unique IDs for new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application uses React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate
  
  React.memo is used appropriately for the TodoApp component to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that useCallback is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  
  `useCallback` is used for the `handleToggleAll` function in the TodoApp component to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage handling is implemented in a modern way
  
  LocalStorage operations are properly implemented using `JSON.parse` and `JSON.stringify`, and the data is persisted with a `useEffect` hook.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows consistent naming conventions throughout the application
  
  The code has consistent naming conventions throughout, using camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for components, and clear, descriptive names.

- **Fail** (80%): Verify that proper error handling is implemented where necessary
  
  The code lacks explicit error handling for localStorage operations which could fail in certain environments or if the quota is exceeded. Try-catch blocks should be implemented where appropriate.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware
  
  The Redux store is properly configured using `configureStore` which automatically sets up the Redux DevTools extension and includes thunk middleware by default.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that React.lazy is used for code splitting where appropriate
  
  There is no evidence of React.lazy being used for code splitting in the provided codebase, which was one of the requirements in the evaluation steps.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that the codebase has no TODOs remaining
  
  There are no explicit TODO comments in the codebase, but without seeing the entire application code, we can't be 100% certain.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux Provider wraps the application entry point
  
  The Redux Provider correctly wraps the application entry point in the index.tsx file.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure strict TypeScript type checking is implemented throughout the application
  
  The code uses proper TypeScript typing throughout, including interfaces for state and props, explicit return types, and proper typing for Redux actions and state.
