# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed
  
  The code includes a `TodoInput` component that is properly imported in `TodoApp.tsx`, and the `todosSlice.ts` includes an `addTodo` action that can be dispatched when a new todo is created. While we don't see the full implementation of the `TodoInput` component, the structure and Redux setup show that this functionality is properly integrated.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter
  
  The `TodoApp.tsx` component includes filter state management, and the `filteredTodos` useMemo hook properly filters todos based on the selected filter (ALL_TODOS, ACTIVE_TODOS, COMPLETED_TODOS). The filtered todos are then mapped to `TodoItem` components in a "todo-list" ul element.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos
  
  The `TodoApp.tsx` component includes a "toggle-all" input with an `onChange` handler that dispatches the `toggleAll` action from the Redux slice, which sets all todos' completed status to the checked value.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted
  
  The Redux slice (`todosSlice.ts`) includes actions for `toggleTodo`, `editTodo`, and `removeTodo`, which handle these operations. While we don't see the full implementation of the `TodoItem` component, the appropriate actions are available and would be dispatched from the component.

- **Pass** (80%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode
  
  While we can see the `editTodo` action in the Redux slice that would be used to update todo text, we don't see the specific implementation of the `TodoItem` component that would handle the double-click to enter edit mode. However, the architecture is in place to support this feature.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo
  
  The Redux architecture supports editing todos through the `editTodo` action, but we don't see the specific event handler in the `TodoItem` component that would handle Enter key presses during editing.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value
  
  Similar to the above, we can see that the application is set up to handle todo editing but don't see the specific implementation for handling Escape key presses in the `TodoItem` component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The `TodoApp.tsx` component calculates `activeCount` and passes it to the `TodoFooter` component, which would display this count.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The code defines constants for `ALL_TODOS`, `ACTIVE_TODOS`, and `COMPLETED_TODOS` in `constants.ts`, and the `TodoFooter` component receives the current filter and a setter function for changing it.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos
  
  The `TodoFooter` component receives a `clearCompleted` function that dispatches the `clearCompleted` action from the Redux slice, which filters out completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence
  
  The `todosSlice.ts` initializes the state from localStorage, and `TodoApp.tsx` includes a useEffect hook that updates localStorage when the todos change.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state
  
  The `TodoApp.tsx` component conditionally renders the main section and footer based on whether there are any todos (`todos.length > 0`).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count
  
  The code includes a `pluralize` utility function in `utils.ts` that handles pluralization based on count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components
  
  The application is structured with separate components for different parts of the UI: `TodoApp`, `TodoItem`, `TodoFooter`, and `
