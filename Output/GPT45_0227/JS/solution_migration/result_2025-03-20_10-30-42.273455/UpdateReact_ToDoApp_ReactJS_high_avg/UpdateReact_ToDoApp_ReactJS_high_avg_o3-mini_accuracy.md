# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all React imports use React 18.x compatible syntax  
  The code in `index.tsx` uses the `createRoot` API from React DOM, which is compatible with React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all components use functional component syntax with hooks instead of class components  
  All components (e.g., `TodoApp`, etc.) are implemented as functional components and utilize hooks.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Redux Toolkit's createSlice is used for state management  
  The `todosSlice.ts` file clearly uses Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` to manage the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for all props, state, and Redux store  
  The code defines an `ITodo` interface in `types.ts` and applies TypeScript types in the store and components appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses immutable state updates in reducers  
  The usage of Redux Toolkit (which leverages Immer) ensures that state updates are made immutably.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that nanoid is used for ID generation instead of custom UUID implementation  
  The implementation in `todosSlice.ts` imports and uses `nanoid` for generating IDs.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application uses React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate  
  The `TodoApp` component is wrapped with `React.memo`, which helps prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that useCallback is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders  
  The event handler `handleToggleAll` in `TodoApp` is wrapped with `useCallback`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage handling is implemented in a modern way  
  The code retrieves and stores the todos using `localStorage.getItem`, `JSON.parse`, and `localStorage.setItem` inside a `useEffect`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows consistent naming conventions throughout the application  
  The naming conventions used in file names, variables, and functions are consistent and clear throughout the codebase.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that proper error handling is implemented where necessary  
  The code does not implement any error handling (e.g., try/catch) for operations like parsing JSON from localStorage. This could lead to runtime errors if the stored data is malformed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware  
  The store is set up using Redux Toolkitâ€™s `configureStore`, which automatically applies the recommended middleware including support for immutable updates and serializability checks.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that React.lazy is used for code splitting where appropriate  
  The example does not include any usage of `React.lazy` for code splitting; all components are loaded directly without lazy-loading, which is a missed opportunity for optimization in larger applications.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the codebase has no TODOs remaining  
  There are no TODO comments or placeholders left in the provided code.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux Provider wraps the application entry point  
  In `index.tsx`, the application is properly wrapped in a `<Provider store={store}>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure strict TypeScript type checking is implemented throughout the application  
  The codebase is written in TypeScript with type interfaces and type definitions applied consistently, ensuring strict type checking.
