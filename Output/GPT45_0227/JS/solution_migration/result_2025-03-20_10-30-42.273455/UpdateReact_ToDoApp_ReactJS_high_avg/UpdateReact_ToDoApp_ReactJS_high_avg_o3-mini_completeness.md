# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The provided answer lists a TodoInput component in the project structure and uses it in TodoApp, but no implementation is shown. Without the component’s code, we cannot confirm that pressing the Enter key creates new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The TodoApp component defines a filteredTodos variable using useMemo and maps these to TodoItem components. This indicates that the list is filtered and displayed based on the current filter value.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  The TodoApp component includes a “toggle-all” checkbox with an onChange handler calling dispatch(toggleAll(...)), verifying that toggling all todos is implemented.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  The todosSlice defines reducers for toggling, editing, and removing todos, and the TodoApp renders individual TodoItem components. Although the TodoItem implementation is not shown, the presence of these reducers provides a strong indication that individual operations are supported. (Slight uncertainty since the TodoItem component’s details are missing.)

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  There is no provided code for the TodoItem component to determine if double-clicking triggers an editing mode. The answer does not include this behavior explicitly.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  The answer does not include the implementation details for editing a todo (e.g., in TodoItem or an editing component), so we cannot verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  As with the previous editing functionality, there is no code provided to confirm the behavior for handling the Escape key during editing.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooter component is passed the activeCount prop, and the activeCount is computed in TodoApp as the count of todos that are not completed. Although the footer’s actual rendering is not shown, the design suggests that active item count display functionality is intended. (Minor uncertainty due to the absence of the actual TodoFooter implementation code.)

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The TodoFooter is given the current filter and a setFilter function as props, indicating that it should handle filtering. The actual UI implementation isn’t provided, but the design supports the required filter functionality.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  The TodoFooter component is passed a clearCompleted prop that is connected to the clearCompleted reducer in todosSlice. Although we do not see the TodoFooter button implementation, the design meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  A useEffect hook in TodoApp updates localStorage with the todos array whenever it changes, ensuring persistence across sessions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  The TodoApp component conditionally renders both the section containing the list and the footer based on whether there are any todos (i.e. todos.length > 0).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  The provided utility function pluralize correctly returns either the singular or plural form based on the count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The answer breaks down the application into several components (TodoApp, TodoItem, TodoFooter, TodoInput) and separates Redux logic via a slice. This demonstrates proper component decomposition.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The provided project structure is well-organized, with components, features, hooks, and other utilities placed in distinct folders.
