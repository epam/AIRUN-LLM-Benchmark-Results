# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration
  
  The code clearly shows the use of Create React App with TypeScript template as indicated by the command `npx create-react-app virtual-piano-react --template typescript` and the use of `.tsx` file extensions. The code also uses React 18 patterns like imports from 'react' and functional components with hooks.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure
  
  The code defines appropriate TypeScript types and interfaces. The `Note` type is defined as a union of string literals, and there's a properly typed `Record<Note, HTMLAudioElement>` for the sound mapping. The `PianoKey` interface is also well-defined.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks
  
  All components (`App` and `Piano`) are implemented as functional components with the React.FC type annotation. They utilize hooks such as useState, useCallback, and useEffect appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)
  
  The code uses useState for managing state like `showLetters`, `isFullscreen`, and `activeNotes`. It also properly uses useEffect for handling side effects like adding/removing event listeners.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels
  
  Keyboard event handlers (`handleKeyDown` and `handleKeyUp`) are properly implemented in the Piano component with useCallback for optimization and are correctly attached to the window in useEffect.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions are implemented using React synthetic events
  
  Mouse events (onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseLeave) are correctly implemented using React's synthetic event system on the piano keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment
  
  Audio resources are handled properly with the HTMLAudioElement API, with proper initialization in the audio.ts file and playback control in the Piano component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility
  
  Fullscreen functionality correctly uses the Fullscreen API with `requestFullscreen()` and `exitFullscreen()`, and properly handles the fullscreen state with React useState and useEffect hooks.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns
  
  Conditional class application is correctly implemented using template literals and ternary operators, following React patterns, such as `` className={`piano ${showLetters ? 'letters' : ''}`} `` and `` className={`btn btn-notes ${!showLetters ? 'btn-active' : ''}`} ``.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate
  
  The Piano component is wrapped with React.memo for performance optimization, and useCallback is used for memoizing functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations
  
  Audio playback is properly managed with the play method and setting currentTime to 0 for replaying sounds. The implementation correctly considers React's lifecycle by using useCallback for the playNote and stopNote functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application
  
  The code consistently uses TypeScript typing throughout, with proper interfaces, type annotations for component props, explicit return types for functions, and typed state with useState<Set<Note>>.
