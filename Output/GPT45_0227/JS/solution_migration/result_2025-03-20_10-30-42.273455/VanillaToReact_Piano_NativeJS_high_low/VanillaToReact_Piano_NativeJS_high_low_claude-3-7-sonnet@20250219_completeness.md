# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'
  
  The provided code includes a header component with the class "header" and contains an h1 element with the class "header-title" displaying "Virtual Piano".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons
  
  The code includes a div with class "btn-container" containing two buttons: one with class "btn btn-notes" labeled "Notes" and another with class "btn btn-letters" labeled "Letters".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)
  
  The Piano component correctly renders seven natural keys (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) and five sharp keys (C♯, D♯, F♯, G♯, A♯), with a placeholder for the missing sharp between E and F.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes
  
  Each piano key is rendered with appropriate data-letter and data-note attributes as defined in the keys and sharpKeys arrays.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked
  
  The application includes a soundMapper that maps each note to an HTMLAudioElement. When a key is clicked (onMouseDown), the corresponding sound is played with playNote function.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)
  
  The code uses an activeNotes state (Set) to track which notes are currently active, and applies the "piano-key-active" class to highlight the pressed keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes
  
  The Piano component uses useEffect to add keyboard event listeners for keydown and keyup events, which call handleKeyDown and handleKeyUp functions respectively to play and stop notes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked
  
  The App component uses a showLetters state that toggles between true and false when the respective buttons are clicked, and passes this state to the Piano component, which applies the "letters" class conditionally.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes
  
  The application implements a toggleFullscreen function that uses the Fullscreen API to enter/exit fullscreen mode, with appropriate state tracking and event listeners.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly
  
  The application uses a Set for activeNotes to efficiently track multiple active notes, and the keyboard event handlers properly manage this state.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys
  
  The provided code handles mouseDown, mouseUp, and mouseLeave events but doesn't implement explicit functionality for dragging across keys. The mouseLeave handler will stop the note when the mouse leaves a key, but there's no mechanism to detect entering a new key while the mouse button is still pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information
  
  The code includes a footer component with class "footer" containing a div with class "footer-container" displaying "2020".
