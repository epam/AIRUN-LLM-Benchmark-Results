# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'  
  The header is implemented using a <code>header</code> tag with an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element containing "Virtual Piano".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons  
  The code clearly defines a <code>div</code> with class <code>btn-container</code> and two buttons for "Notes" and "Letters" with appropriate onClick handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)  
  The <code>Piano</code> component maps over two arrays (<code>keys</code> and <code>sharpKeys</code>) to render the natural keys and sharp keys respectively, ensuring all are rendered.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes  
  Each piano key is given <code>data-letter</code> and <code>data-note</code> attributes (when available), both for natural keys and sharp keys, which meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked  
  The code uses a <code>soundMapper</code> to look up an <code>HTMLAudioElement</code> for a given note, resets its playback time, and calls <code>play()</code> on it when a piano key is clicked. Audio playback is therefore correctly implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)  
  An <code>activeNotes</code> state is maintained, and the class <code>piano-key-active</code> is conditionally applied to keys when active, providing visual feedback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes  
  Keyboard event listeners for <code>keydown</code> and <code>keyup</code> are set up. They correctly map pressed keys (via the <code>letter</code> field) to their corresponding notes, triggering audio playback and highlighting.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked  
  The toggle buttons update a state variable <code>showLetters</code> which is passed down to the <code>Piano</code> component, influencing its CSS classes to switch views accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes  
  The <code>toggleFullscreen</code> function utilizes the Fullscreen API (with <code>requestFullscreen</code> and <code>exitFullscreen</code>) and correctly updates the UI to reflect the mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly  
  The use of a <code>Set</code> to manage <code>activeNotes</code> enables the app to track multiple active keys concurrently.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys  
  The implementation provides handlers for <code>onMouseDown</code>, <code>onMouseUp</code>, and <code>onMouseLeave</code>, which work correctly for individual key clicks. However, there is no explicit handling (e.g., an <code>onMouseEnter</code> event while the mouse button remains pressed) to support dragging the mouse across keys to trigger multiple notes. This may lead to incomplete support of true mouse-drag behavior.  
  *Explanation: While key activation on click is handled well, a fully robust drag interaction typically requires detecting when the mouse enters a new key with the mouse button held down. Without this, the feature might not work as expected.*

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information  
  A footer is present in the <code>App</code> component, which displays the year "2020" inside a container.
