    While the migration guide includes functionality for editing todos in the Redux slice with the `editTodo` action, and mentions implementing keyboard shortcuts and event handlers in the relevant components, the specific focus management implementation details aren't explicitly shown in the code examples. However, the instructions do mention implementing these features using React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef) which would be the appropriate approach.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos
