# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18.x  
  The entry point uses ReactDOM.createRoot, which is a React 18.x API.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript for type safety  
  The code files use .tsx and .ts extensions and include TypeScript interfaces.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for state management  
  The provided slice in todosSlice.ts uses createSlice from Redux Toolkit.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm nanoid is used for generating unique IDs  
  The todosSlice.ts uses the nanoid package when preparing an addTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code uses functional components with hooks instead of class components  
  Components are written as React functional components and use hooks like useDispatch and useSelector.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure the application maintains the same routing functionality with proper route handling  
  The routing is handled via BrowserRouter, Routes, and a custom TodoListWrapper using useParams.  
  [Slight caution due to minimal detail in error boundaries or fallback routes.]

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Redux store is properly configured with appropriate slices  
  The store is configured in store.ts with the todos slice as reducer.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the Redux provider is set up in the application entry point  
  The index.tsx wraps the App component with the Redux Provider.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for all data structures  
  Interfaces for Todo and Filter are provided. However, additional explicit types for some component props (beyond what is shown) could further enhance type safety.  
  [Confidence reduced slightly because not all component interfaces are fully detailed.]

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the code follows React best practices for component composition  
  The code demonstrates clear separation of concerns and component structuring. Minor improvements to further optimize or memoize components could be considered.

- **Fail** (80%): Confirm the application handles keyboard events properly (Enter key for creating/updating todos, Escape key for canceling edits)  
  Although step 11 mentions the implementation of keyboard shortcuts using hooks, no concrete code is provided for handling these keyboard events in the example components.  
  [Confidence is slightly reduced as the instructions outline the plan but the implementation details are missing.]

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application maintains local storage persistence if implemented  
  The todosSlice.ts includes loadTodos and saveTodos functions to handle local storage persistence.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  The provided code examples appear clean; however, without a runtime environment there is a small margin of uncertainty.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application implements proper error handling  
  The code does not exhibit explicit error handling (e.g., try-catch blocks for localStorage operations), which could be problematic in failure scenarios.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the code is optimized with no unnecessary re-renders  
  The structure and usage of selectors and hooks suggest a good level of optimization, though further performance tuning (like memoization) might enhance re-render control in larger applications.
