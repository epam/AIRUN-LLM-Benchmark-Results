# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos  
  The provided guide explicitly shows a header section in App.tsx containing an <h1> element with the title "todos" and a <TodoInput /> component responsible for creating new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos  
  In Step 6, the TodoList component is implemented with a <section className="main"> that includes an input with class "toggle-all" and renders a list of todos.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button  
  While the TodoList component renders a <TodoItem /> for every todo, the guide does not include an explicit implementation of the TodoItem component. The instructions mention to "Implement remaining components similarly" without confirming the details required (e.g. a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button) are included.  
  Explanation: The absence of explicit code for the TodoItem makes it uncertain whether all necessary elements are provided.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode  
  The guide does not detail an implementation for handling a double-click on a todo label to switch into editing mode. Although editing functionality is mentioned in the Redux slice (via editTodo) and some keyboard handling is hinted at in Step 11, no specific code for double-click behavior is provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The routing in App.tsx and filtering logic in TodoList demonstrate that the application supports filtering by reading a filter parameter from the URL and filtering todos accordingly.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization  
  Although a TodoFooter component is listed and included in App.tsx, the guide omits an explicit implementation or description of pluralization logic for the count of remaining todos.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter  
  The TodoFooter component is mentioned as part of the project structure and included in the main App layout, but there is no explicit code provided that demonstrates filter links with visual highlighting for the current selection.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist  
  The guide states that the Redux slice implements clearCompleted functionality; however, it does not explicitly show that the footer renders a 'Clear completed' button conditionally when there are completed todos.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter  
  The guide references a TodoInput component for creating todos but does not provide its implementation. This omission leaves some uncertainty about proper handling of the Enter key even though the intended functionality is mentioned.  
  Explanation: Without the explicit TodoInput implementation, we assume functionality based on standard practices but cannot verify the keyboard event handling details.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos  
  Although the Redux slice includes a toggleTodo reducer, the provided guide lacks the explicit UI implementation details within the TodoItem component to confirm this behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once  
  The TodoList component includes a toggle-all checkbox that dispatches the toggleAll action, clearly supporting toggling all todos simultaneously.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management  
  While an editTodo reducer exists in the Redux slice, the guide does not include specific code in the UI (e.g., within TodoItem or a dedicated editing view) to ensure proper focus management during editing.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos  
  The Redux slice offers a deleteTodo action, yet no explicit UI implementation (for example, a delete button inside TodoItem) is provided, leaving this functionality unverified.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos  
  The clearCompleted reducer is implemented in the Redux slice. However, the guide does not illustrate any UI element (such as a button in TodoFooter) that triggers this action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status  
  The filtering logic in the TodoList component works by checking the current filter (all, active, completed) and filtering the list accordingly, ensuring that only the appropriate todos are rendered.
