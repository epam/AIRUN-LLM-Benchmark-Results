# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Check that the tests are isolated and do not depend on each other.
- **Pass**: Each test case is self-contained and does not rely on the state or outcome of other tests. The `beforeEach` block ensures a fresh state for each test.

### Step 2: Validate that the tests adhere to best practices for unit testing.
- **Pass**: The tests are well-structured, focusing on individual components and their behavior. They use `render`, `fireEvent`, and `waitFor` from `@testing-library/react` to simulate user interactions and verify outcomes.

### Step 3: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
- **Pass**: The code avoids duplication by using helper functions like `renderWithReduxForm` to render components with necessary context. The tests are concise and avoid repeating setup code.

### Step 4: Verify that the testing environment is set up correctly.
- **Pass**: The `jest.config.js` file is correctly configured to set up the testing environment with `@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect` and `jsdom` as the test environment.

### Step 5: Check if a testing library for JavaScript (such as Jest) has been chosen.
- **Pass**: Jest is used as the testing library, as indicated by the presence of `jest.config.js` and relevant dependencies in `package.json`.

### Step 6: Validate that dependencies are mocked where necessary, such as API calls.
- **Pass**: API calls and actions are mocked using `jest.mock`, ensuring that tests do not make real network requests and are isolated from external dependencies.

### Step 7: Verify that the test coverage for the code is at least 80%.
- **Fail**: The provided information does not include test coverage reports. Therefore, it is not possible to verify if the test coverage is at least 80%.

### Step 8: Confirm that the package.json file includes necessary dependencies and scripts for running tests.
- **Pass**: The `package.json` file includes necessary dependencies such as `@testing-library/react`, `jest`, `redux-mock-store`, and `redux-thunk`. However, it does not explicitly show scripts for running tests, but this is a minor issue as the dependencies are correctly listed.

### Step 9: Confirm that the tests use the proper methods and assertions from the chosen testing library.
- **Pass**: The tests use appropriate methods and assertions from `@testing-library/react` and `@testing-library/jest-dom`, such as `render`, `screen`, `fireEvent`, `waitFor`, `expect`, and custom matchers like `toBeInTheDocument`.

## Summary

- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 9
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 8
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 1

Overall, the tests are well-written, isolated, and adhere to best practices. The only missing piece is the verification of test coverage, which should be addressed to ensure comprehensive testing.
