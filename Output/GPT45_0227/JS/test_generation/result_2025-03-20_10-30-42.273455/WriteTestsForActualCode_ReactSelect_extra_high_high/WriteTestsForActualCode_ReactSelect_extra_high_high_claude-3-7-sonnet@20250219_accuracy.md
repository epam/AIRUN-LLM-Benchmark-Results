# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up in the test file
  
  The answer includes proper setup of Jest and React Testing Library with the correct imports, configuration files, and setup files.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test cases are properly isolated and do not have interdependencies
  
  Each test case in the answer is self-contained with its own rendering and assertions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that DOM events are simulated using proper React Testing Library methods
  
  The answer correctly uses userEvent methods for user interactions including click, type, keyboard, tab, and touch events.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that accessibility attributes are being tested appropriately
  
  The answer includes specific tests for ARIA attributes such as aria-haspopup, aria-expanded, and aria-selected.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure mocks are used for external dependencies where appropriate
  
  The answer correctly uses jest.fn() for mocking the onChange and onInputChange callback functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of async/await for asynchronous testing where needed
  
  The answer consistently uses async/await with user events that are asynchronous, such as userEvent.click(), userEvent.type(), etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all assertions use appropriate Jest matchers
  
  The answer uses appropriate Jest matchers like toBeInTheDocument(), toHaveAttribute(), toHaveBeenCalledWith(), not.toBeInTheDocument(), etc.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that tests include proper cleanup after each test case
  
  While React Testing Library's render function automatically handles cleanup, the answer does not explicitly mention afterEach cleanup. However, the tests are structured in a way that avoids leakage between tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test descriptions clearly indicate what functionality is being tested
  
  Each test has a clear and descriptive title that accurately reflects what is being tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the test file follows best practices for organizing test cases (describe/it blocks)
  
  The answer uses describe blocks to group related tests and individual test blocks with descriptive names.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that all event handlers are tested using appropriate simulation methods
  
  The answer tests onChange and onInputChange handlers using appropriate user event simulations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the test environment correctly simulates both mouse and keyboard interactions
  
  The answer includes specific tests for both mouse interactions (click) and keyboard interactions (tab, ArrowDown, Enter, Escape).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for touch events properly simulate mobile interactions
  
  The answer includes a specific test for touch interactions using userEvent.touch().
