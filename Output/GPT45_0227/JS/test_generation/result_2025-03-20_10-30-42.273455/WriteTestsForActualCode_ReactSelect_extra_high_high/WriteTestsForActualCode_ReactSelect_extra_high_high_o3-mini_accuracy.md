# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up in the test file  
  The answer includes a proper Jest configuration (`jest.config.js`), imports in `jest.setup.ts`, and installation instructions for the necessary dependencies.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test cases are properly isolated and do not have interdependencies  
  Each test case uses its own render call, and there is no shared mutable state between tests evident in the provided code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that DOM events are simulated using proper React Testing Library methods  
  The answer demonstrates the use of methods from React Testing Library and userEvent (`click`, `keyboard`, `type`, `touch`), which are appropriate for DOM event simulation.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that accessibility attributes are being tested appropriately  
  There is a dedicated test to check the ARIA attributes (such as `aria-haspopup` and `aria-expanded`) on the component, confirming the accessibility testing is in place.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure mocks are used for external dependencies where appropriate  
  Mocks are correctly applied using `jest.fn()` for event handlers like `onChange` and `onInputChange` in the default props.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of async/await for asynchronous testing where needed  
  The asynchronous user interactions (keyboard navigation, mouse clicks, touch events) are correctly wrapped with `await`, ensuring proper asynchronous testing.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all assertions use appropriate Jest matchers  
  Assertions such as `toBeInTheDocument`, `toHaveAttribute`, and `not.toBeInTheDocument` are correctly used to validate the expected outcomes.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that tests include proper cleanup after each test case  
  While the code does not explicitly include cleanup functions (like `afterEach`), React Testing Library automatically handles cleanup between tests. The slight reduction in confidence stems from the lack of an explicit cleanup call, though it is acceptable given recent RTL versions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test descriptions clearly indicate what functionality is being tested  
  The test case names are descriptive (e.g., "renders with default props", "keyboard navigation works correctly", "does not open menu when disabled"), which makes it clear what each test is verifying.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the test file follows best practices for organizing test cases (describe/it blocks)  
  The tests are well-organized using `describe` blocks to group related tests and individual `test` or `it` blocks to cover specific scenarios.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that all event handlers are tested using appropriate simulation methods  
  The tests comprehensively simulate event interactions (keyboard, mouse, and touch) to verify that event handlers function as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the test environment correctly simulates both mouse and keyboard interactions  
  The test file appropriately simulates mouse interactions (using `userEvent.click`) and keyboard interactions (using `userEvent.keyboard`), ensuring that both are effectively handled.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for touch events properly simulate mobile interactions  
  The inclusion of a test using `userEvent.touch` confirms that the component's touch interactions are also covered, simulating mobile interaction scenarios.
