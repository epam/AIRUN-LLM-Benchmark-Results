# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist  
  The answer includes a "Basic Rendering Test" that renders the component with default props and checks for elements like the combobox and placeholder text ("Select...").

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present  
  The answer contains a dedicated "keyboard navigation works correctly" test that uses tab, arrow keys, and enter, and an additional test using the Escape key in the "menu opens and closes correctly" test.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)  
  The answer has a "mouse interaction selects option" test that verifies mouse click selection functionality.

- **Fail** (95%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior  
  The answer includes a test verifying the controlled behavior (using a value prop and then rerendering the component with a new value). However, there is no specific test covering uncontrolled behavior. The provided default props and tests only focus on the controlled scenario.  

- **Fail** (95%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values  
  While tests for selecting options using keyboard and mouse are present, no tests explicitly handle removing or clearing selected values. This omission indicates incomplete coverage for state changes beyond simple selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented  
  The answer includes a "menu opens and closes correctly" test which confirms that the menu opens on click and closes on pressing Escape.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality  
  An "Option Filtering" test is provided where the input is typed and the filtering of options is verified.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist  
  The provided tests only demonstrate scenarios for a single-select component. There are no tests addressing the behavior of multi-select functionality if that is expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility  
  There is a specific test ("has correct ARIA attributes") which checks for necessary ARIA attributes on the combobox.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested  
  The "renders no options message" test confirms that the component handles the empty options edge case appropriately.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states  
  The answer does not include any tests for scenarios when the component is in a loading state or when it encounters an error.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states  
  A test ("does not open menu when disabled") is present, confirming that the component behaves correctly when a disabled state is applied.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance  
  A performance test ("renders efficiently with large option set") is included to check the componentâ€™s rendering performance with a large number of options.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested  
  The keyboard navigation tests verify that focus is correctly managed (e.g., calling userEvent.tab() and checking that the combobox has focus).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering  
  The tests check for the presence of the placeholder text ("Select...") and validate value rendering in the controlled component behavior test.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations  
  There are no tests addressing custom rendering logic such as custom formatting for option labels, if applicable.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)  
  Although onChange and onInputChange callbacks are indirectly tested in selection tests, there are no tests verifying callbacks for onMenuOpen, onMenuClose, or other potential callback functions.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)  
  The answer does not include tests for verifying the presence or behavior of indicator components such as dropdown arrows, clear indicators, or loading spinners.
