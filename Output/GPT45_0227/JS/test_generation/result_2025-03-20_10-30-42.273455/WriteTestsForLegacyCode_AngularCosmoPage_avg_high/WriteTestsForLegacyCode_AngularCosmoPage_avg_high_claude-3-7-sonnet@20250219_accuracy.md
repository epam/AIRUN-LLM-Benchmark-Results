# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)
  
  The code clearly uses Jasmine as the testing framework and Karma as the test runner, as shown in the configuration and test suite examples. The karma.conf.js file explicitly sets `frameworks: ['jasmine']` and the test files follow Jasmine's syntax with `describe`, `it`, `beforeEach`, etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints
  
  The tests properly mock REST API endpoints using $httpBackend to intercept HTTP requests. For example, in rest.spec.js, there are clear examples of mocking GET, PUT requests with `$httpBackend.expectGET('api/blocks/1').respond(mockResponse);` and other similar patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation
  
  All test examples include proper beforeEach hooks for setup and dependency injection. The REST Factory tests also include afterEach hooks to verify there are no outstanding HTTP expectations or requests with `$httpBackend.verifyNoOutstandingExpectation();` and `$httpBackend.verifyNoOutstandingRequest();`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls
  
  All HTTP requests are properly mocked using $httpBackend. For example, GET, PUT, and DELETE requests are mocked in various test files with expectGET, expectPUT, and expectDELETE methods, followed by .respond() to specify mock responses.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection
  
  The tests correctly use AngularJS's dependency injection pattern. For example, in pageCtrl.spec.js, dependencies like $controller, $rootScope, REST, Page, etc. are properly injected using the inject function and underscore notation (_$controller_, _$rootScope_, etc.).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations
  
  Asynchronous operations are properly handled by using $httpBackend.flush() after setting up mock HTTP expectations. This ensures that promises are resolved before assertions are made.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies
  
  The tests use spies appropriately, for example: `spyOn($location, 'path');` in pageCtrl.spec.js to verify navigation, and `spyOn($rootScope, '$broadcast');` to verify error handling behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization
  
  All tests follow the describe/it pattern consistently, with clear and descriptive test names that explain what functionality is being tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls
  
  The tests cover both success scenarios (e.g., successfully fetching a block by ID) and error scenarios (e.g., "should handle errors gracefully" in rest.spec.js and "should handle savePage errors gracefully" in pageCtrl.spec.js).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate
  
  The tests simulate user interactions by calling controller methods that would be triggered by user actions, such as `$scope.deletePage();` and `$scope.savePage();` in pageCtrl.spec.js.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage
  
  The tests use afterEach hooks to verify no outstanding HTTP expectations or requests remain, preventing state leakage between tests. This is particularly evident in the REST Factory tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested
  
  All tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what functionality is being tested, such as "should fetch a block by ID", "should initialize with default values", and "should handle savePage errors gracefully".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible
  
  The tests appropriately focus on validating the expected outcomes rather than implementation details. For example, they check expected property values, verify functions were called with specific parameters, and confirm the expected behavior occurred.
