# Evaluation Report

Below is the evaluation based on the provided answer against the specified evaluation steps.

1. **Pass** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources  
   The provided answer includes a "Testing the REST Factory" section (rest.spec.js) that covers calls to different REST endpoints (blocks, users, and content). Although it might not cover 100% of all possible REST resources, the core ones mentioned are present.

2. **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly  
   The "Testing the Page Factory" (page.spec.js) verifies that the default properties (id, title, extras) are properly initialized and can be updated.

3. **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly  
   The "Testing the Users Factory" (users.spec.js) confirms that the default properties (id, username) are correctly set and can be updated.

4. **Fail** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods  
   The tests for the page controller (pageCtrl.spec.js) cover page initialization, page deletion, and error handling of savePage. However, they do not cover all public methods that were expected (such as additional functions like titleChange, saveLocal, and autocompleteTags).

5. **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller  
   The test "should initialize page variables correctly" confirms the initialization of page variables (e.g., title and scheduleDate).

6. **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation  
   There is no test present for a titleChange function that would auto-generate URLs from page titles. The answer does not include any code or test that refers to a titleChange function.

7. **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction  
   No tests in the provided answer verify the behavior of a saveLocal function or its interactions with localStorage.

8. **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality  
   The answer does not include any tests relating to an autocompleteTags function or tag suggestion behavior.

9. **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)  
   The tests for savePage only cover an error handling branch (server error). There is no evidence that other branches (e.g., handling new pages, detecting duplicates, or updating existing pages) are tested.

10. **Fail** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types  
    There are no tests demonstrating handling of edge cases such as empty URLs or unexpected page types.

11. **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly  
    The deletePage function is tested thoroughly by simulating multiple HTTP DELETE calls and verifying the redirection, which confirms that the deletion functionality works as expected.

12. **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions  
    The provided tests do not include coverage for page versioning logic or interactions with localStorage besides what is implied in other functions.

13. **Fail** (100%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components  
    Although the approach mentions a minimum of 80% coverage and includes configuration for coverage reporting, there is no evidence (via tests or coverage results) that this threshold is met for all components.

14. **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling  
    The test for the savePage error handling uses $rootScope.$broadcast with a notification event to validate event broadcasting, which meets this requirement.

15. **Fail** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality  
    The only check related to scheduling is a test that confirms $scope.page.scheduleDate is defined. There is no thorough test of the date handling logic or scheduling functionality.
