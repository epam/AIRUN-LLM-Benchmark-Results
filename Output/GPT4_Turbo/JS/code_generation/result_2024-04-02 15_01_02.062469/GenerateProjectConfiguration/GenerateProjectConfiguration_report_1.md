Your task is to create a project configuration based on the Vite builder with support for React, Redux, React-Router, TypeScript, and testing library.

When generating the code, ensure to adhere to the instructions below:
- Describe the provided commands.
- Provide a package.json file.
- The generated code should not contain any TODOs.
- Simply return the codebase without additional comments within the code.

## Run 1:
### Answer:
To create a project configuration that meets your requirements, follow the steps below. This setup will include Vite as the build tool, along with support for React, Redux, React-Router, TypeScript, and the testing library.

### Step 1: Project Initialization

First, you need to create a new project directory and initialize a new project. Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir my-vite-react-project
cd my-vite-react-project
npm init vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
```

These commands do the following:
- `mkdir my-vite-react-project`: Creates a new directory for your project.
- `cd my-vite-react-project`: Changes the current directory to your new project directory.
- `npm init vite@latest . -- --template react-ts`: Initializes a new Vite project with a template that supports React and TypeScript.

### Step 2: Installing Dependencies

After initializing the project, you need to install additional dependencies for Redux, React-Router, and the testing library. Run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install redux react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit react-router-dom
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event jest jest-environment-jsdom ts-jest
```

This command installs:
- `redux`, `react-redux`, `@reduxjs/toolkit` for state management.
- `react-router-dom` for routing.
- `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `@testing-library/user-event` for testing React components.
- `jest`, `jest-environment-jsdom`, `ts-jest` for unit testing with Jest in a TypeScript environment.

### Step 3: Configuring Jest

To configure Jest for TypeScript, create a `jest.config.js` file in your project root with the following content:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  preset: 'ts-jest',
  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest-setup.ts'],
  moduleNameMapper: {
    '\\.(css|less|sass|scss)$': 'identity-obj-proxy',
  },
};
```

Then, create a `jest-setup.ts` file for any global test setup, including extending Jest with custom matchers from `@testing-library/jest-dom`:

```typescript
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
```

### Step 4: `package.json` Configuration

Your `package.json` should include scripts for building, serving, and testing your application. Here's an example configuration that includes these scripts:

```json
{
  "name": "my-vite-react-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@reduxjs/toolkit": "^1.8.0",
    "react": "^18.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.0.0",
    "react-redux": "^8.0.0",
    "react-router-dom": "^6.3.0",
    "redux": "^4.2.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.16.1",
    "@testing-library/react": "^13.0.0",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^14.0.0",
    "@types/jest": "^28.0.0",
    "@types/react": "^18.0.0",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18.0.0",
    "@types/react-router-dom": "^5.3.2",
    "jest": "^28.0.0",
    "jest-environment-jsdom": "^28.0.0",
    "ts-jest": "^28.0.0",
    "typescript": "^4.5.2",
    "vite": "^3.0.0"
  }
}
```

This configuration sets up your project with the necessary scripts for development, building, previewing, and testing your application. It also includes the dependencies and devDependencies required for your project setup.

### Conclusion

With these steps, you have successfully configured a Vite project with support for React, Redux, React-Router, TypeScript, and the testing library. You can now start developing your application by adding your React components, setting up Redux for state management, configuring your routes with React-Router, and writing tests with Jest and the testing library.
