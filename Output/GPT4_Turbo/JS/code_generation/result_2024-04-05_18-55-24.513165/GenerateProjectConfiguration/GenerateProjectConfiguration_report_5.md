Your task is to create a project configuration based on the Vite builder with support for React, Redux, React-Router, TypeScript, and testing library.

When generating the code, ensure to adhere to the instructions below:
- Describe the provided commands.
- Provide a package.json file.
- The generated code should not contain any TODOs.
- Simply return the codebase without additional comments within the code.

### Answer:
To create a project configuration that meets your requirements, follow the steps below. This setup will include Vite as the build tool, along with support for React, Redux, React-Router, TypeScript, and the testing library.

### Step 1: Project Initialization

First, you need to create a new Vite project with React and TypeScript. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-vite-react-app -- --template react-ts
```

This command creates a new directory named `my-vite-react-app` with a Vite project setup for React and TypeScript.

### Step 2: Navigate to Your Project

Change into your project directory:

```bash
cd my-vite-react-app
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Now, install the additional dependencies required for Redux, React-Router, and the testing library:

```bash
npm install redux react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit react-router-dom
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/user-event @testing-library/jest-dom
```

This command installs Redux and its React bindings, React-Router for routing, and the necessary testing libraries for unit testing.

### Step 4: Update `package.json`

Below is the `package.json` file tailored to include scripts for running, building, and testing your application, along with the dependencies you've just installed.

```json
{
  "name": "my-vite-react-app",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "test": "vitest"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.0.0",
    "react-redux": "^8.0.0",
    "@reduxjs/toolkit": "^1.8.0",
    "react-router-dom": "^6.0.0",
    "redux": "^4.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.14.1",
    "@testing-library/react": "^12.1.2",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^13.2.1",
    "@types/react": "^18.0.0",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18.0.0",
    "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^1.0.0",
    "typescript": "^4.5.2",
    "vite": "^2.6.4",
    "vitest": "^0.0.117"
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Configure TypeScript

Ensure your `tsconfig.json` is set up for React. Vite's template should have already configured this for you, but here's a basic configuration for reference:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "esnext",
    "module": "esnext",
    "strict": true,
    "jsx": "preserve",
    "importHelpers": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "types": ["jest"],
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["src/*"]
    },
    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"]
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*.ts", "src/**/*.tsx", "src/**/*.d.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

### Step 6: Running Your Application

To start your application, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command starts the Vite development server.

### Step 7: Building Your Application

For building the application for production, use:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 8: Previewing Your Build

To preview the production build locally, use:

```bash
npm run preview
```

### Step 9: Running Tests

To run your tests, use:

```bash
npm run test
```

This setup provides a solid foundation for a React application using Vite, TypeScript, Redux, React-Router, and the testing library. You can now proceed to develop your application's components, state management, routes, and tests.
