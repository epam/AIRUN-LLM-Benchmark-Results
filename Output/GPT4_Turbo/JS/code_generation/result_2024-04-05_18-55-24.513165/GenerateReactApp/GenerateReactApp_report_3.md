Your task is to create an application on React 18.x that can utilize the SWAPI open API to fetch characters and display them in a list.

When completing the task, ensure to follow the instructions below:
- Use Create React App, TypeScript, and axios.
- Display a loader while loading.
- Do not include any input fields; only load the data initially and display it.
- Optimize the code where possible.
- The generated code should not contain any TODOs.
- Return the codebase without additional comments.

API Description:
GET https://swapi.dev/api/people?search={search}
Response:
{ results: Array<{ name: string, url: string }> }

### Answer:
To accomplish the task, follow these steps to create a React application that fetches and displays characters from the SWAPI using Create React App, TypeScript, and axios.

### Step 1: Setting Up the Project

First, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Then, open your terminal and run the following commands to create a new React application with TypeScript:

```bash
npx create-react-app swapi-characters --template typescript
cd swapi-characters
npm install axios
```

### Step 2: Creating the Character List Component

Create a new file `CharacterList.tsx` in the `src` directory. This component will be responsible for fetching the characters from the SWAPI and displaying them.

```tsx
// src/CharacterList.tsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

interface Character {
  name: string;
  url: string;
}

const CharacterList: React.FC = () => {
  const [characters, setCharacters] = useState<Character[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchCharacters = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await axios.get('https://swapi.dev/api/people');
        setCharacters(response.data.results);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to fetch characters:', error);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    fetchCharacters();
  }, []);

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <ul>
      {characters.map((character) => (
        <li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};

export default CharacterList;
```

### Step 3: Updating the App Component

Now, update the `App.tsx` file to include the `CharacterList` component.

```tsx
// src/App.tsx
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';
import CharacterList from './CharacterList';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <CharacterList />
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Step 4: Running the Application

Finally, start the application by running:

```bash
npm start
```

This will compile the TypeScript code, start the development server, and open the application in your default web browser. You should now see a list of characters fetched from the SWAPI displayed on the page.

### Optimization and Best Practices

- The code above demonstrates basic fetching and state management in React. For larger applications, consider using context or state management libraries like Redux or MobX for better state management.
- Error handling is minimal in the example. In a production application, you should provide user-friendly error messages and possibly retry mechanisms for failed requests.
- The `useEffect` hook is used without dependencies to ensure the data is fetched only once when the component mounts. This is a common pattern for fetching data in React components.
- Axios is used for HTTP requests due to its wide adoption and ease of use, but you can also use the native `fetch` API if you prefer.

This setup provides a solid foundation for a React application that fetches and displays data from an external API, following modern React practices and TypeScript for type safety.
