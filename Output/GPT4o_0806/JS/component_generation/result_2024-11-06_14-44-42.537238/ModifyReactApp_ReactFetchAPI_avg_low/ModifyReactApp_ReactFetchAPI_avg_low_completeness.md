# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps:

1. **Check that a loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.**
   - **Pass**: The code includes a loading state (`loading`) and conditionally renders a loading indicator (`<div>Loading...</div>`) when `loading` is `true`.

2. **Verify that the loader does not hide the search input when data is loading.**
   - **Pass**: The search input is always rendered regardless of the loading state, ensuring it is not hidden when data is loading.

3. **Validate that a request with an empty search term is sent on the initial render.**
   - **Pass**: The `useEffect` hook triggers `debouncedFetchCharacters(searchTerm)` on initial render, and since `searchTerm` is initially an empty string, a request with an empty search term is sent.

4. **Verify that the search input field is present.**
   - **Pass**: The search input field is present in the JSX (`<input type="text" placeholder="Search characters" value={searchTerm} onChange={handleSearchChange} />`).

5. **Ensure that the character search functionality is implemented.**
   - **Pass**: The character search functionality is implemented using the `fetchCharacters` function, which fetches characters based on the search term.

6. **Ensure that the API request includes the search term as a query parameter.**
   - **Pass**: The `fetchCharacters` function constructs the API URL with the search term as a query parameter (`https://swapi.dev/api/people/?search=${query}`).

7. **Validate that the data is loading on initial app load with empty query and then when the search term changes.**
   - **Pass**: The `useEffect` hook ensures data is loaded on initial app load and whenever the search term changes.

8. **Ensure that the debounced fetch function prevents unnecessary API requests.**
   - **Pass**: The `debouncedFetchCharacters` function uses `lodash.debounce` to delay the API call, preventing unnecessary requests.

9. **Confirm that the character list is updated based on the search results.**
   - **Pass**: The character list is updated based on the search results, as the `characters` state is set with the fetched data and rendered in the JSX.

10. **Validate that the application handles API request errors.**
    - **Pass**: The `fetchCharacters` function includes a `try-catch` block to handle API request errors and logs them to the console.

11. **Ensure that the user experience remains smooth without backend overloads.**
    - **Pass**: The use of debouncing ensures that the backend is not overloaded with requests, providing a smooth user experience.
