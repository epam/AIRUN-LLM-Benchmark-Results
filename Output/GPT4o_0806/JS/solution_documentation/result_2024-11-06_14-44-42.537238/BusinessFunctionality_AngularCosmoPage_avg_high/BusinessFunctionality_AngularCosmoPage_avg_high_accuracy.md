# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Ensure that the application uses `$resource` objects for RESTful API communication.**
   - **Pass**: The `REST` factory in `rest.js` provides a set of resources for interacting with a RESTful backend using `$resource`.

2. **Verify that the application saves page changes to local storage.**
   - **Pass**: The application uses local storage to save unsaved changes, allowing users to revert to a previous version of a page if needed.

3. **Confirm that the application initializes the page type correctly.**
   - **Pass**: The `pageCtrl.js` controller manages the creation, editing, and deletion of pages, including initializing page attributes such as type.

4. **Validate that the application manages local storage for unsaved changes.**
   - **Pass**: The application uses local storage to save unsaved changes, ensuring data integrity and providing a recovery mechanism.

5. **Verify that the application handles errors during saving or updating pages.**
   - **Fail**: The provided answer does not explicitly mention error handling during saving or updating pages.

6. **Confirm that the application broadcasts events to update page variables and settings when necessary.**
   - **Fail**: The provided answer does not explicitly mention broadcasting events to update page variables and settings.

7. **Validate that the application uses promises and callbacks for asynchronous operations.**
   - **Pass**: The application uses asynchronous operations for API calls, which helps maintain performance by not blocking the UI during data retrieval or updates.

8. **Validate that the application broadcasts notifications for various operations (e.g., page saving, updating, deleting).**
   - **Fail**: The provided answer does not explicitly mention broadcasting notifications for various operations.

9. **Verify that the application supports scalability and maintainability through modular design.**
   - **Pass**: The application is built using AngularJS, which supports modular design, aiding in scalability and maintainability.

10. **Confirm that the application optimizes performance through efficient API usage and local storage management.**
    - **Pass**: The application uses `$resource` for efficient API communication and local storage for quick saving of unsaved changes.
