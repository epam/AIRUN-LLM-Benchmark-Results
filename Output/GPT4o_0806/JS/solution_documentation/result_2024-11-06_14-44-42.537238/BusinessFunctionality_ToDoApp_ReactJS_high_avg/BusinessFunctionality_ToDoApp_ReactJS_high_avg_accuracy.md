# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Confirm that constraints related to local storage limitations are noted.**
   - **Pass**: The report mentions that the application relies on local storage for data persistence, which may not be suitable for large datasets or shared environments.

2. **Verify that assumptions about the application being designed for a single user are mentioned.**
   - **Pass**: The report states that the application is designed for single-user use, as it does not support user authentication or multi-user data separation.

3. **Ensure that browser compatibility assumptions are included.**
   - **Pass**: The report includes the assumption that the browser supports local storage and modern JavaScript features used in the code.

4. **Check that performance-related constraints are noted.**
   - **Pass**: The report mentions that local storage provides quick access to data but is not scalable for large applications or datasets.

5. **Confirm that performance optimizations, such as the use of `shouldComponentUpdate`, are identified.**
   - **Pass**: The report identifies the use of the `shouldComponentUpdate` method in `TodoItem` to prevent unnecessary re-renders, improving performance.

6. **Verify that considerations for using immutable data structures for performance are mentioned.**
   - **Pass**: The report notes the use of immutable data structures (e.g., `map`, `filter`, `reduce`) to maintain performance and make the code easier to reason about.

7. **Ensure scalability considerations related to local storage limitations are discussed.**
   - **Pass**: The report discusses that while local storage provides quick access to data, it is not scalable for large applications or datasets.

8. **Check that the potential need for a backend service for better scalability is mentioned.**
   - **Fail**: The report does not mention the potential need for a backend service for better scalability.

9. **Confirm that the evaluation steps are unambiguous and concise.**
   - **Pass**: The evaluation steps are clear and concise, allowing the evaluator to assess the output based solely on the provided code.

10. **Ensure that each step allows the evaluator to assess the output based solely on the provided code.**
    - **Pass**: Each step is designed to allow the evaluator to assess the output based on the provided code.

11. **Verify that the steps are clearly articulated and cover all main points of the task.**
    - **Pass**: The steps are clearly articulated and cover all main points of the task.
