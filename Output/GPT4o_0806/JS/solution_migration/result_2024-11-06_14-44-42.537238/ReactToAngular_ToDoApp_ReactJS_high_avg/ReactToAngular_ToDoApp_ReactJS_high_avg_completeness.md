# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that the main component displays the header with input for new todos.
**Pass**: The `app.component.html` contains a header with an input field for new todos.

### Step 2: Ensure that adding a new todo item works correctly.
**Pass**: The `handleNewTodoKeyDown` method in `app.component.ts` handles adding a new todo item when the Enter key is pressed.

### Step 3: Verify that the todo list displays all added todo items.
**Pass**: The `app.component.html` uses `*ngFor` to iterate over `todos$` and display each todo item using the `app-todo-item` component.

### Step 4: Confirm that toggle functionality works for marking todos as completed.
**Pass**: The `toggle` method in `todo-item.component.ts` dispatches the `toggle` action to mark todos as completed.

### Step 5: Check that editing a todo item works and updates the todo item correctly.
**Pass**: The `handleEdit`, `handleKeyDown`, and `handleSubmit` methods in `todo-item.component.ts` handle editing and updating a todo item.

### Step 6: Ensure that deleting a todo item removes it from the list.
**Pass**: The `destroy` method in `todo-item.component.ts` dispatches the `destroy` action to remove a todo item from the list.

### Step 7: Verify that the footer correctly displays the count of active items.
**Pass**: The `footer.component.html` displays the count of active items using the `activeCount` input property.

### Step 8: Confirm that the footer's clear completed button works and removes completed items.
**Pass**: The `clearCompleted` method in `app.component.ts` dispatches the `clearCompleted` action to remove completed items, and the button in `footer.component.html` emits the `clearCompleted` event.

### Step 9: Check that filtering todos by "all", "active", and "completed" works correctly.
**Fail**: The filtering functionality is not implemented in the provided code. The `nowShowing` state is present, but there is no logic to filter the todos based on this state.

### Step 10: Ensure that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works correctly.
**Pass**: The `toggleAll` method in `app.component.ts` dispatches the `toggleAll` action to mark all todos as complete.

### Step 11: Check that the application persists todos to local storage and reloads them correctly.
**Fail**: There is no implementation for persisting todos to local storage and reloading them in the provided code.
