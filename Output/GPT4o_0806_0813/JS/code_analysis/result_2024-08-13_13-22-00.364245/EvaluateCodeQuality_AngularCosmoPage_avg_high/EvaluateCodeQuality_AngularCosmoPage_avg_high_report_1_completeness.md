# Evaluation Report

## Readability
### 1. Inconsistent Naming Conventions
**Pass**: The code uses inconsistent naming conventions, such as camelCase and snake_case, which can be confusing. The suggestion to stick to one convention, preferably camelCase for JavaScript, is valid.

### 2. Long and Complex Functions
**Pass**: The function `savePage` in `pageCtrl.js` is identified as long and complex. The suggestion to break it into smaller, more focused functions is appropriate and improves readability.

## Maintainability
### 1. Hardcoded Strings
**Pass**: The code contains hardcoded strings, especially in URLs. The suggestion to use constants or configuration files is valid and improves maintainability.

### 2. Repeated Code
**Pass**: The code has repeated blocks, such as setting local storage items. The suggestion to refactor them into a utility function is appropriate and enhances maintainability.

## Performance
### 1. Inefficient DOM Manipulation
**Pass**: The use of `ng-repeat` without a track by expression is identified as inefficient. The suggestion to add a track by expression is valid and improves performance.

## Accessibility
### 1. Missing ARIA Attributes
**Pass**: The HTML lacks ARIA attributes. The suggestion to add ARIA roles and properties is valid and improves accessibility.

## Best Practices
### 1. Use of Deprecated AngularJS Features
**Pass**: The use of deprecated AngularJS features is identified. The suggestion to upgrade to Angular or use modern frameworks like React or Vue.js is valid and aligns with best practices.

## Testing
### 1. Lack of Unit Tests
**Pass**: The code lacks unit tests. The suggestion to use Jasmine or Karma for testing AngularJS applications is valid and improves code quality and reliability.

## Documentation
### 1. Insufficient Comments
**Pass**: The code lacks detailed comments explaining the purpose and functionality of complex logic. The suggestion to add comments is valid and helps future developers understand the code better.
