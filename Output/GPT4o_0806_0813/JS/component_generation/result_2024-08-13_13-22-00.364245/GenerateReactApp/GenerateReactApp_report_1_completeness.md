# Evaluation Report

## Step-by-Step Evaluation

### Step 1: Ensure that the API call to https://swapi.dev/api/people is made using axios.
**Pass**: The code uses `axios.get('https://swapi.dev/api/people')` to fetch data from the SWAPI API.

### Step 2: Make sure the data is fetched initially without any input fields.
**Pass**: The data is fetched within the `useEffect` hook, which runs on component mount, ensuring the data is fetched initially without any input fields.

### Step 3: Ensure a loader or loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass**: The code includes a loading state (`loading`) and displays `<div>Loading...</div>` while the data is being fetched.

### Step 4: Verify that errors are logged to the console if the API call fails.
**Pass**: The code includes a `catch` block in the `try...catch` statement that logs errors to the console using `console.error('Error fetching data:', error)`.

### Step 5: Ensure that the fetched characters are displayed in a list format.
**Pass**: The fetched characters are displayed in an unordered list (`<ul>`) with each character rendered as a list item (`<li>`).

### Step 6: Make sure each list item has a unique key derived from the characterâ€™s URL.
**Pass**: Each list item uses `character.url` as the key, ensuring uniqueness.
