# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Pass**: Ensure that the application uses `$resource` objects for RESTful API communication.
   - The provided code includes a REST Factory (`rest.js`) that provides a set of `$resource` objects for interacting with a RESTful backend.

2. **Pass**: Verify that the application saves page changes to local storage.
   - The Page Controller (`pageCtrl.js`) manages local storage for unsaved changes, ensuring that users do not lose their work unexpectedly.

3. **Pass**: Confirm that the application initializes the page type correctly.
   - The Page Controller handles the initialization of page types, allowing users to select a page type from a dropdown.

4. **Pass**: Validate that the application manages local storage for unsaved changes.
   - The application uses local storage to manage unsaved changes, notifying users of unsaved changes from previous sessions and allowing them to revert or discard these changes.

5. **Pass**: Verify that the application handles errors during saving or updating pages.
   - The Page Controller includes error handling mechanisms for saving and updating pages, ensuring that users are informed of any issues.

6. **Pass**: Confirm that the application broadcasts events to update page variables and settings when necessary.
   - The application broadcasts events to update page variables and settings, ensuring that the state is consistent across different components.

7. **Pass**: Validate that the application uses promises and callbacks for asynchronous operations.
   - The application uses promises and callbacks for asynchronous operations, ensuring that server communication is handled efficiently.

8. **Pass**: Validate that the application broadcasts notifications for various operations (e.g., page saving, updating, deleting).
   - The application broadcasts notifications for various operations, keeping users informed of the status of their actions.

9. **Pass**: Verify that the application supports scalability and maintainability through modular design.
   - The application is designed with modular components, such as the REST Factory, Page Factory, Users Factory, and Page Controller, supporting scalability and maintainability.

10. **Pass**: Confirm that the application optimizes performance through efficient API usage and local storage management.
    - The application optimizes performance by using `$resource` for efficient API communication and local storage for managing unsaved changes, reducing the need for frequent server requests.
