# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that the main component displays the header with input for new todos.
- **Pass**: The `app.component.html` contains a header with an input field for new todos.

### Step 2: Ensure that adding a new todo item works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `handleNewTodoKeyDown` method in `AppComponent` dispatches the `addTodo` action when the Enter key is pressed.

### Step 3: Verify that the todo list displays all added todo items.
- **Pass**: The `app.component.html` uses `*ngFor` to iterate over `todos$` and displays each todo item using the `app-todo-item` component.

### Step 4: Confirm that toggle functionality works for marking todos as completed.
- **Pass**: The `toggle` method in `TodoItemComponent` dispatches the `toggle` action, and the `todoReducer` handles this action to update the todo's completed status.

### Step 5: Check that editing a todo item works and updates the todo item correctly.
- **Pass**: The `handleSubmit` method in `TodoItemComponent` dispatches the `save` action, and the `todoReducer` handles this action to update the todo's title.

### Step 6: Ensure that deleting a todo item removes it from the list.
- **Pass**: The `destroy` method in `TodoItemComponent` dispatches the `destroy` action, and the `todoReducer` handles this action to remove the todo from the list.

### Step 7: Verify that the footer correctly displays the count of active items.
- **Pass**: The `app-todo-footer` component receives `activeCount$` as an input and displays the count of active items.

### Step 8: Confirm that the footer's clear completed button works and removes completed items.
- **Pass**: The `clearCompletedTodos` method in `TodoFooterComponent` emits the `clearCompleted` event, which is handled by the `clearCompleted` method in `AppComponent` to dispatch the `clearCompleted` action.

### Step 9: Check that filtering todos by "all", "active", and "completed" works correctly.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include the implementation for filtering todos by "all", "active", and "completed". The `nowShowing` state is defined, but there are no actions or reducers to update this state based on the filter.

### Step 10: Ensure that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `toggleAll` method in `AppComponent` dispatches the `toggleAll` action, and the `todoReducer` handles this action to mark all todos as completed or not completed.

### Step 11: Check that the application persists todos to local storage and reloads them correctly.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include any functionality for persisting todos to local storage or reloading them from local storage.
