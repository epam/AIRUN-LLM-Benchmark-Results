# Evaluation Report

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.**
   - **Pass**: All imports in the provided code are used and necessary for the functionality of the application.

2. **Ensure the codebase is structured and follows React best practices (state, hooks, effects).**
   - **Pass**: The codebase uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`) appropriately and follows best practices for state management and side effects.

3. **Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.**
   - **Pass**: The use of `useCallback` for the `play` and `resetActive` functions helps prevent unnecessary re-renders. The cleanup function in `useEffect` ensures that event listeners are removed, preventing memory leaks.

4. **Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.**
   - **Pass**: The code uses modern React and TypeScript features, indicating compatibility with the latest versions.

5. **Verify the application works correctly across modern browsers.**
   - **Pass**: The code does not contain any browser-specific features that would limit its compatibility with modern browsers.

6. **Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.**
   - **Pass**: There are no apparent issues in the code that would cause console errors or warnings.

7. **Verify that the new React app initializes successfully without errors.**
   - **Pass**: The initialization steps (`npx create-react-app virtual-piano --template typescript` and `cd virtual-piano`) are standard and should initialize the app without errors.

8. **Verify that the codebase does not contain any TODOs.**
   - **Pass**: The provided code does not contain any TODO comments.

9. **Ensure the application has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.**
   - **Pass**: The provided React code replicates the DOM structure and classes as described in the original application.

10. **Verify the application UI matches the original HTML structure visually.**
    - **Pass**: The CSS and JSX structure provided should result in a UI that matches the original HTML structure visually.

11. **Verify the application handles rapid sequential key presses without audio overlap issues.**
    - **Pass**: The `sound.currentTime = 0;` line in the `play` function ensures that the audio restarts from the beginning, preventing overlap issues during rapid key presses.

### Summary
