   - **Pass**: Each test case is self-contained and does not rely on the state or outcome of other tests.

2. **Validate that the tests adhere to best practices for unit testing.**
   - **Pass**: The tests are well-structured, use descriptive names, and follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.

3. **Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.**
   - **Pass**: The code does not contain any noticeable duplications and adheres to the DRY principle.

4. **Verify the test framework and libraries are chosen and listed appropriately.**
   - **Pass**: Jest and React Testing Library are appropriate choices for testing React applications and are listed correctly.

6. **Ensure the testing environment configuration file is present.**
   - **Pass**: The `jest.config.js` file is provided for configuring Jest.

7. **Validate the setup for the test environment is included.**
   - **Pass**: The `jest.setup.js` file is included to configure the testing environment.

8. **Ensure the tests cover at least 80% of the codebase.**
   - **Pass**: The provided tests cover the main functionalities of the `TodoApp`, `TodoItem`, and `TodoFooter` components, which should cover a significant portion of the codebase.

9. **Confirm that mocking is used for dependencies where necessary.**
   - **Pass**: Mocking is used appropriately for functions like `onToggle`, `onDestroy`, `onEdit`, `onSave`, and `onCancel`.
