# Evaluation Report

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.**
   - **Pass**: All imports (`React`, `useEffect`, `useState`, `useCallback`, `axios`, `debounce`) are used in the code.

2. **Ensure the codebase is structured and follows React best practices (state, hooks, effects).**
   - **Pass**: The code uses `useState` for state management, `useEffect` for side effects, and `useCallback` for memoizing functions.

3. **Check that a debounced function is used to optimize the search requests.**
   - **Pass**: The `debounce` function from `lodash.debounce` is used to optimize the search requests.

4. **Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.**
   - **Pass**: The use of `useCallback` and `debounce` helps in preventing unnecessary re-renders and potential memory leaks.

5. **Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.**
   - **Pass**: The code uses modern React hooks and TypeScript, ensuring compatibility with the latest versions.

6. **Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.**
   - **Pass**: There are no apparent console errors or warnings in the provided code.

7. **Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.**
   - **Pass**: The app uses React's state (`searchTerm`) to manage the value of the text field.

8. **Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React virtual DOM.**
   - **Pass**: There is no direct DOM manipulation outside of React's virtual DOM.

9. **Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React state and props.**
   - **Pass**: The app does not use refs for DOM access; it uses state and props appropriately.

10. **Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.**
    - **Pass**: The code is clean and does not contain any duplicates, adhering to DRY principles.

11. **Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.**
    - **Pass**: The use of `useCallback` and `debounce` helps in minimizing unnecessary re-renders.

12. **Confirm that the useState is used to capture the search input value.**
    - **Pass**: `useState` is used to capture and manage the search input value (`searchTerm`).

13. **Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs.**
    - **Pass**: There are no TODOs in the provided code.

14. **Verify the inclusion of TypeScript in the React application.**
    - **Pass**: The code uses TypeScript interfaces and type annotations.

15. **Ensure that `axios` is used for making API requests.**
    - **Pass**: `axios` is used for making API requests to the SWAPI.

16. **Validate that the `useEffect` hooks are used correctly for data loading.**
    - **Pass**: `useEffect` is used correctly to load data when the component mounts and when `fetchCharacters` changes.
