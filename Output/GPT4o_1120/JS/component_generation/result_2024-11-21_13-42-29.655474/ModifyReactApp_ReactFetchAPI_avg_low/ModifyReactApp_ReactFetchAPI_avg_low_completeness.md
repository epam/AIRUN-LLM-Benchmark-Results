# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that a loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass** - The code sets `loading` to `true` before fetching data and displays "Loading..." when `loading` is `true`.

### Step 2: Verify that the loader does not hide the search input when data is loading.
**Pass** - The search input is always rendered regardless of the `loading` state.

### Step 3: Validate that a request with an empty search term is sent on the initial render.
**Pass** - The `useEffect` hook calls `fetchCharacters` with an empty query on initial render.

### Step 4: Verify that the search input field is present.
**Pass** - The search input field is rendered in the return statement of the component.

### Step 5: Ensure that the character search functionality is implemented.
**Pass** - The `handleSearchChange` function updates the `searchTerm` state and calls `debouncedFetchCharacters`.

### Step 6: Ensure that the API request includes the search term as a query parameter.
**Pass** - The `fetchCharacters` function includes the search term as a query parameter in the API request.

### Step 7: Validate that the data is loading on initial app load with empty query and then when the search term changes.
**Pass** - The `useEffect` hook ensures data is loaded on initial app load, and `handleSearchChange` ensures data is loaded when the search term changes.

### Step 8: Ensure that the debounced fetch function prevents unnecessary API requests.
**Pass** - The `debouncedFetchCharacters` function uses `debounce` to limit the frequency of API requests.

### Step 9: Confirm that the character list is updated based on the search results.
**Pass** - The `setCharacters` function updates the `characters` state with the search results, which are then rendered in the list.

### Step 10: Validate that the application handles API request errors.
**Pass** - The `fetchCharacters` function includes a `try-catch` block to handle API request errors and logs them to the console.

### Step 11: Ensure that the user experience remains smooth without backend overloads.
**Pass** - The use of `debounce` in `debouncedFetchCharacters` helps to prevent backend overloads by limiting the frequency of API requests.
