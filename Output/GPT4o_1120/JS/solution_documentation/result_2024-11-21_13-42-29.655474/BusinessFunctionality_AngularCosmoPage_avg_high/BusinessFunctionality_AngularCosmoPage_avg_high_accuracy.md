# Evaluation Report

### **Evaluation Steps**

#### **1. Ensure that the application uses `$resource` objects for RESTful API communication.**
- **Pass**: The application uses the `REST` factory to define multiple `$resource` endpoints for interacting with backend APIs.

#### **2. Verify that the application saves page changes to local storage.**
- **Pass**: The application uses `localStorage` to temporarily save unsaved changes.

#### **3. Confirm that the application initializes the page type correctly.**
- **Pass**: The application allows users to select a page type from a dropdown menu during page creation.

#### **4. Validate that the application manages local storage for unsaved changes.**
- **Pass**: The application provides functionality for saving and restoring unsaved changes using `localStorage`.

#### **5. Verify that the application handles errors during saving or updating pages.**
- **Fail**: The provided code does not explicitly mention error handling during saving or updating pages.

#### **6. Confirm that the application broadcasts events to update page variables and settings when necessary.**
- **Pass**: The application broadcasts events to update page variables and settings.

#### **7. Validate that the application uses promises and callbacks for asynchronous operations.**
- **Pass**: The application uses `$resource` which inherently supports promises for asynchronous operations.

#### **8. Validate that the application broadcasts notifications for various operations (e.g., page saving, updating, deleting).**
- **Fail**: The provided code does not explicitly mention broadcasting notifications for various operations.

#### **9. Verify that the application supports scalability and maintainability through modular design.**
- **Pass**: The application uses a modular design with factories (`REST`, `Page`, `Users`) to support scalability and maintainability.

#### **10. Confirm that the application optimizes performance through efficient API usage and local storage management.**
- **Pass**: The application optimizes performance through the use of `$resource` for efficient API usage and `localStorage` for managing unsaved changes.
