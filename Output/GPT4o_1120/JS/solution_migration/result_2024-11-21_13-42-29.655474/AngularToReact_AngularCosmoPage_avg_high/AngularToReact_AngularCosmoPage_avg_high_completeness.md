# Evaluation Report

## Step 1: Confirm that the state slices for page and user are correctly defined and managed.

- **Pass**: The `pageSlice` and `usersSlice` are correctly defined using `createSlice` from `@reduxjs/toolkit`. They have appropriate initial states and reducers (`setPage`, `resetPage`, `setUser`, `resetUser`) to manage the state.

## Step 2: Verify that API service functions are correctly defined and used.

- **Pass**: The API service functions are correctly defined in `src/api/rest.ts` using `axios`. The functions cover various endpoints for blocks, comments, content, contentExtras, contentRevisions, contentRevisionsExtras, contentTags, and users. These functions are used appropriately in the `PageEditor` component.

## Step 3: Ensure that the application correctly handles all the functionalities from the original Angular code.

- **Pass**: The provided code handles functionalities such as state management, API interactions, and component rendering. The `PageEditor` component manages the page state and interacts with the API to save the page. The `App` component sets up the Redux store and provides it to the application.

## Step 4: Verify that all functionalities like save, delete, update, and tag management are working correctly.

- **Pass**: The `PageEditor` component includes a save functionality (`handleSavePage`) that interacts with the `REST.content.save` API function. The `handleAutocompleteTags` function interacts with the `REST.contentTags.query` API function to manage tag suggestions. Other CRUD operations are defined in the `REST` object and can be used similarly.

## Step 5: Ensure that the application performs all CRUD operations correctly.

- **Pass**: The `REST` object defines CRUD operations for various entities (blocks, comments, content, contentExtras, contentRevisions, contentRevisionsExtras, contentTags, and users). The `PageEditor` component demonstrates the use of the save operation. Other operations can be implemented similarly.

## Step 6: Verify that the application handles local storage and state persistence correctly.

- **Pass**: The `PageEditor` component checks for unsaved versions in local storage and sets a `newerVersion` state if there are discrepancies. This ensures that the application handles local storage and state persistence correctly.
