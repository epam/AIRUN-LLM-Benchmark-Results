# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that the main component displays the header with input for new todos.
- **Pass**: The `app.component.html` contains a header with an input field for new todos.

### Step 2: Ensure that adding a new todo item works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `handleNewTodoKeyDown` method in `app.component.ts` dispatches the `addTodo` action when the Enter key is pressed, and the new todo is added to the store.

### Step 3: Verify that the todo list displays all added todo items.
- **Pass**: The `app.component.html` uses `*ngFor` to iterate over `todos$` and display each todo item using the `app-todo-item` component.

### Step 4: Confirm that toggle functionality works for marking todos as completed.
- **Pass**: The `toggle` method in `todo-item.component.ts` dispatches the `toggleTodo` action, which updates the completed status of the todo item in the store.

### Step 5: Check that editing a todo item works and updates the todo item correctly.
- **Pass**: The `edit` method in `todo-item.component.ts` sets the `editing` state to true, and the `save` method dispatches the `saveTodo` action to update the todo item in the store.

### Step 6: Ensure that deleting a todo item removes it from the list.
- **Pass**: The `destroy` method in `todo-item.component.ts` dispatches the `destroyTodo` action, which removes the todo item from the store.

### Step 7: Verify that the footer correctly displays the count of active items.
- **Pass**: The `footer.component.html` displays the count of active items using the `activeCount` input property.

### Step 8: Confirm that the footer's clear completed button works and removes completed items.
- **Pass**: The `clear` method in `footer.component.ts` emits the `clearCompleted` event, which is handled by the `clearCompleted` method in `app.component.ts` to dispatch the `clearCompleted` action.

### Step 9: Check that filtering todos by "all", "active", and "completed" works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `setFilterType` method in `footer.component.ts` emits the `setFilter` event, which is handled by the `setFilter` method in `app.component.ts` to dispatch the `setFilter` action. The `selectNowShowing` selector correctly filters the todos based on the current filter.

### Step 10: Ensure that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `toggleAll` method in `app.component.ts` dispatches the `toggleAll` action, which updates the completed status of all todos in the store.

### Step 11: Check that the application persists todos to local storage and reloads them correctly.
- **Fail**: There is no implementation for persisting todos to local storage and reloading them in the provided code.
