### Step 3: Verify that adding a new todo works correctly.

### Step 5: Confirm that toggling a todo item completion status works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoListComponent` allows users to toggle the completion status of todos. The `onToggle` method dispatches the `toggleTodo` action, and the `todoReducer` handles this action to update the todo's completion status in the state.

### Step 6: Ensure that removing a todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoListComponent` allows users to remove todos. The `onRemove` method dispatches the `removeTodo` action, and the `todoReducer` handles this action to remove the todo from the state.

### Step 9: Confirm that the "Clear completed" button works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFooterComponent` allows users to clear completed todos. The `onClearCompleted` method dispatches the `clearCompleted` action, and the `todoReducer` handles this action to remove all completed todos from the state.

### Step 10: Ensure that the application is responsive and functions correctly on different screen sizes.
- **Pass**: The provided code uses standard Angular components and CSS classes, which should ensure basic responsiveness. However, without specific CSS or media queries provided, this is assumed to be correct.
