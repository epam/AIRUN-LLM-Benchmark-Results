## Step 1: Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.
**Pass**: All imports in the provided code are used appropriately.

## Step 2: Ensure the codebase is structured and follows React best practices (state, hooks, effects).
**Pass**: The codebase is well-structured and follows React best practices. State management is handled using `useState`, and side effects are managed with `useEffect`.

## Step 3: Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.
**Pass**: The use of `useEffect` for adding and removing event listeners is correctly implemented, preventing memory leaks. The state updates are managed efficiently to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

## Step 4: Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.
**Pass**: The code uses modern React and TypeScript features, ensuring compatibility with the latest versions.

## Step 5: Verify the application works correctly across modern browsers.
**Pass**: The code does not contain any browser-specific features that would prevent it from working across modern browsers.

## Step 6: Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.
**Pass**: The code does not contain any obvious issues that would result in console errors or warnings.

## Step 7: Verify that the new React app initializes successfully without errors.
**Pass**: The provided code should initialize successfully without errors, given that all dependencies are correctly installed.

## Step 8: Verify that the codebase does not contain any TODOs.
**Pass**: The codebase does not contain any TODO comments.

## Step 9: Ensure the application has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.
**Pass**: The provided code maintains the same DOM tree structure and classes as described.

## Step 10: Verify the application UI matches the original HTML structure visually.
**Pass**: The CSS and JSX structure ensure that the application UI matches the original HTML structure visually.

## Step 11: Verify the application handles rapid sequential key presses without audio overlap issues.
**Pass**: The `play` function resets the `currentTime` of the audio element to 0 before playing, which helps in handling rapid sequential key presses without audio overlap issues.
