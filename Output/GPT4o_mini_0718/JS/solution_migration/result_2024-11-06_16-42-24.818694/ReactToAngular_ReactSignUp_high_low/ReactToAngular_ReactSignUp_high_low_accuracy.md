- **Pass**: All imports in the provided code are used.

### Step 2: Ensure the codebase is structured and follows Angular style guidelines and best practices.
- **Pass**: The code follows Angular style guidelines and best practices, including the use of components, services, and state management.

### Step 3: Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of Angular and TypeScript.
- **Pass**: The code appears to be compatible with the latest version of Angular and TypeScript, though actual compatibility would need to be verified by running the application.

### Step 4: Verify the application works correctly across modern browsers.
- **Fail**: This step cannot be verified without running the application in different browsers.

### Step 5: Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.
- **Fail**: This step cannot be verified without running the application and checking the console for errors and warnings.

### Step 6: Ensure the code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility.
- **Pass**: The code is decomposed into components with single responsibility, such as `SignupComponent`.

### Step 7: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
- **Pass**: The code does not contain any obvious duplicates and follows DRY principles.

### Step 8: Ensure the application is handle API errors.
- **Fail**: The `onSubmit` method in `SignupComponent` has a comment to handle errors, but the actual error handling logic is not implemented.

### Step 9: Validate that @ngrx/store is used for state management and that the state is properly defined in auth.reducer.ts and app.state.ts.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include `auth.reducer.ts` and `app.state.ts`, so this cannot be verified.

### Step 10: Verify the UI and UX by running the Angular application and ensuring that the signup form behaves as expected, including form validation and error messages.
- **Fail**: This step cannot be verified without running the application.

### Step 11: Confirm that the signup action is correctly dispatched from the SignupComponent upon form submission.
- **Pass**: The signup action is correctly dispatched from the `SignupComponent` upon form submission.

### Step 12: Verify app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of Angular framework.
- **Pass**: The app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of the Angular framework.

### Step 13: Verify app does not overuse Angular references for DOM access instead of Angular state and props.
- **Pass**: The app does not overuse Angular references for DOM access.

### Step 14: Check that there are no TODOs or incomplete parts in the code.
- **Fail**: There is a comment indicating that error handling needs to be implemented in the `onSubmit` method.

### Summary
- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 14
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 9
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 5

Overall, the code is well-structured and follows Angular best practices, but there are some areas that need further verification and implementation, particularly around error handling and running the application to check for compatibility and console errors.
