# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Confirm that the application initializes correctly and loads persisted todos.
- **Pass**: The application initializes correctly and loads persisted todos from local storage using the `TodoService`.

### Step 2: Ensure that the todo list displays correctly and is interactive.
- **Pass**: The todo list displays correctly and is interactive. The `TodoListComponent` uses `ngFor` to display todos and binds the `todo-item` component.

### Step 3: Verify that adding a new todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: Adding a new todo works correctly. The `TodoInputComponent` dispatches the `addTodo` action, which updates the state via the `todoReducer`.

### Step 4: Check that editing a todo works correctly.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include functionality for editing a todo. The `TodoItemComponent` does not have any logic for editing a todo item.

### Step 5: Confirm that toggling a todo item completion status works correctly.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include functionality for toggling a todo item's completion status. The `TodoItemComponent` has a checkbox, but there is no action or reducer logic to handle the toggle.

### Step 6: Ensure that removing a todo works correctly.
- **Fail**: The `removeTodo` method in `TodoItemComponent` is not implemented. There is no dispatch action to remove a todo.

### Step 7: Verify that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include functionality for marking all todos as complete. There is no action or reducer logic to handle this functionality.

### Step 8: Check that the filter functionality (All, Active, Completed) works.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include any filter functionality. There are no components, actions, or selectors to handle filtering todos by their status.

### Step 9: Confirm that the "Clear completed" button works correctly.
- **Pass**: The "Clear completed" button works correctly. The `clearCompleted` method in `TodoListComponent` dispatches the `clearCompletedTodos` action, which updates the state via the `todoReducer`.

### Step 10: Ensure that the application is responsive and functions correctly on different screen sizes.
- **Pass**: The application uses standard HTML and CSS practices, and there are no indications that it would not be responsive. The use of `todomvc-app-css` ensures a responsive design.
