# Evaluation Report

## Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
**Pass**: The `TodoApp.tsx` file contains an input field with a `handleKeyDown` function that listens for the Enter key press and dispatches the `addTodo` action with the input value.

## Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
**Fail**: The provided code does not include any filter functionality to display todo items according to the current filter.

## Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
**Pass**: The `TodoApp.tsx` file includes a checkbox with an `onChange` event that toggles the completion status of all todos by dispatching the `toggleTodo` action for each todo.

## Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
**Pass**: The `TodoItem.tsx` file includes functionality to toggle (`onToggle`), and delete (`onDestroy`) each todo item. However, there is no functionality for editing a todo item.

## Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
**Fail**: The provided code does not include any functionality for editing a todo item, starting with a double click, submitting with Enter, or resetting with the Esc button.

## Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
**Fail**: The `TodoFooter.tsx` file displays the count of active items and includes a button to clear completed items, but it does not include any filter functionality.

## Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
**Pass**: The `TodoFooter.tsx` file includes a button to clear completed items, which dispatches the `clearCompleted` action.
