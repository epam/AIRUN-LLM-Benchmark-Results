# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Verify the application contains a button container with "Notes" and "Letters" buttons.
- **Pass**: The application contains a button container with "Notes" and "Letters" buttons as seen in the `App.tsx` file.

### Step 2: Verify the application renders piano keys for both natural and sharp notes.
- **Pass**: The application renders piano keys for both natural and sharp notes. Natural notes are rendered with `data-note` attributes like "c", "d", "e", etc., and sharp notes with attributes like "c♯", "d♯", etc.

### Step 3: Verify clicking on a piano key plays the correct sound and highlights the key.
- **Pass**: The `play` function handles the click event on piano keys, plays the correct sound, and adds the `piano-key-active` class to highlight the key.

### Step 4: Verify releasing the mouse button or moving the cursor out of the key stops the sound and removes the highlight.
- **Pass**: The `resetActive` function handles the mouse button release and cursor out events, stops the sound, and removes the `piano-key-active` class.

### Step 5: Verify pressing and releasing keyboard keys play and stop the corresponding piano notes.
- **Pass**: The `play` and `resetActive` functions handle keyboard events (`keydown` and `keyup`), playing and stopping the corresponding piano notes.

### Step 6: Verify clicking the "Notes" button displays note names on the keys.
- **Pass**: The `change` function handles the click event on the "Notes" button, adding the `letters` class to the piano keys container, which presumably displays note names.

### Step 7: Verify clicking the "Letters" button displays letter names on the keys.
- **Pass**: The `change` function handles the click event on the "Letters" button, removing the `letters` class from the piano keys container, which presumably displays letter names.

### Step 8: Verify the fullscreen button toggles fullscreen mode for the application.
- **Pass**: The `fullscreen` function toggles fullscreen mode for the application by calling `requestFullscreen` and `exitFullscreen`.

### Step 9: Verify the application correctly handles simultaneous multiple key presses.
- **Pass**: The application handles simultaneous multiple key presses by allowing multiple keys to be active and playing their sounds concurrently.
