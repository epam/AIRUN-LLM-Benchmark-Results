# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that the tests are isolated and do not depend on each other.
**Pass**: Each test case is independent and does not rely on the outcome of other tests. The `setup` function ensures that each test starts with a fresh set of props and wrapper.

### Step 2: Validate that the tests adhere to best practices for unit testing.
**Pass**: The tests follow best practices by being specific, isolated, and testing one thing at a time. They use mock implementations for API calls and check for both positive and negative scenarios.

### Step 3: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
**Pass**: The code avoids duplication by using the `setup` function to initialize the component with default props. This function is reused across multiple tests.

### Step 4: Verify that the testing environment is set up correctly.
**Pass**: The testing environment is set up correctly with Jest and Enzyme. The necessary imports and mock implementations are included.

### Step 5: Check if a testing library for JavaScript (such as Jest) has been chosen.
**Pass**: Jest is used as the testing library, and Enzyme is used for rendering and interacting with React components.

### Step 6: Validate that dependencies are mocked where necessary, such as API calls.
**Pass**: API calls are mocked using `jest.mock('../api')`, and specific API methods are mocked within the tests to return controlled responses.

### Step 7: Verify that the test coverage for the code is at least 80%.
**Fail**: The provided code does not include any information about test coverage. To verify this, a coverage report would need to be generated using Jest's coverage tools.

### Step 8: Confirm that the package.json file includes necessary dependencies and scripts for running tests.
**Fail**: The provided code does not include the `package.json` file. This file is necessary to confirm that all required dependencies and scripts for running tests are included.

### Step 9: Confirm that the tests use the proper methods and assertions from the chosen testing library.
**Pass**: The tests use appropriate methods and assertions from Jest and Enzyme, such as `expect`, `toBe`, `shallow`, and `mockImplementation`.

### Summary
- **Total number of steps evaluated**: 9
- **Number of passed steps**: 7
- **Number of failed steps**: 2

Overall, the tests are well-written and follow best practices, but additional information is needed to confirm test coverage and the presence of necessary dependencies in the `package.json` file.
