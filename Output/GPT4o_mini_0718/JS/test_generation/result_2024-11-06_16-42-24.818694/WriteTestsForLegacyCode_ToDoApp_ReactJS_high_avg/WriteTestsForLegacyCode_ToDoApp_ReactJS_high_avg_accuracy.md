# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that the tests are isolated and do not depend on each other.
**Pass**: Each test is independent and uses `beforeEach` to clear mocks, ensuring no dependencies between tests.

### Step 2: Validate that the tests adhere to best practices for unit testing.
**Pass**: The tests follow best practices, such as using `jest.fn()` for mocks, and testing individual components and their behaviors.

### Step 3: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
**Pass**: The code does not contain any significant duplicates and follows DRY principles. Common setup is handled in `beforeEach`.

### Step 4: Verify the test framework and libraries are chosen and listed appropriately.
**Pass**: The tests use `@testing-library/react` and `jest`, which are appropriate choices for React component testing.

### Step 5: Confirm the testing environment setup is included.
**Fail**: The provided code does not include the setup for the testing environment.

### Step 6: Ensure the testing environment configuration file is present.
**Fail**: The provided code does not include a configuration file for the testing environment.

### Step 7: Validate the setup for the test environment is included.
**Fail**: The provided code does not include the setup for the test environment.

### Step 8: Ensure the tests cover at least 80% of the codebase.
**Fail**: The provided code does not include coverage reports, so it is not possible to confirm if the tests cover at least 80% of the codebase.

### Step 9: Confirm that mocking is used for dependencies where necessary.
**Pass**: Mocking is appropriately used for dependencies, such as `TodoModel` and various callback functions.

### Step 10: Verify that the generated code does not contain any TODOs.
**Pass**: The code does not contain any TODOs.
