# Evaluation Report

## Readability

### 1. Long Functions
**Pass**: The `savePage` function was identified as lengthy and handling multiple responsibilities. The suggestion to break it down into smaller, more focused functions was provided and demonstrated.

### 2. Complex Conditional Statements
**Pass**: The conditional logic within the `savePage` function was simplified by breaking it into smaller functions (`saveNewPage` and `updateExistingPage`).

### 3. Unclear Variable Names
**Pass**: No unclear or ambiguous variable names were identified in the provided examples.

### 4. Deeply Nested Code Blocks
**Pass**: The provided code did not contain deeply nested blocks that required flattening.

## Maintainability

### 1. Hard-Coded Strings
**Pass**: Hard-coded strings for API endpoints were identified and replaced with constants to improve maintainability.

### 2. Repeated Code Patterns
**Pass**: The repeated API calls in the `deletePage` function were refactored using `Promise.all` to optimize performance and maintainability.

### 3. Large Files Handling Multiple Responsibilities
**Pass**: The provided examples did not indicate large files handling multiple responsibilities, but the suggestion to break down long functions into smaller ones indirectly addresses this concern.

### 4. Tightly Coupled Code
**Pass**: The use of `$scope` was identified as an anti-pattern, and the suggestion to use `controllerAs` syntax was provided to decouple the code.

### 5. Separation of Concerns
**Pass**: The refactoring of the `savePage` function into smaller functions demonstrates an improvement in the separation of concerns.

## Performance

### 1. Inefficient DOM Manipulation
**Pass**: No inefficient DOM manipulation was identified in the provided examples.

### 2. Unnecessary Watchers
**Pass**: No unnecessary watchers were identified in the provided examples.

### 3. Heavy Initialization
**Pass**: No heavy initialization was identified in the provided examples.

### 4. Redundant API Calls
**Pass**: Redundant API calls in the `deletePage` function were identified and optimized using `Promise.all`.

### 5. Large Scope Variables
**Pass**: No large scope variables that are unnecessarily watched were identified in the provided examples.

## Accessibility

### 1. Missing ARIA Attributes
**Pass**: The missing ARIA attributes on interactive elements were identified and the suggestion to add them was provided.

### 2. Focus Management
**Pass**: No issues with focus management were identified in the provided examples.

### 3. Keyboard Navigation Support
**Pass**: No issues with keyboard navigation support were identified in the provided examples.

### 4. Poor Color Contrast
**Pass**: No issues with poor color contrast were identified in the provided examples.

### 5. Missing Alt Text
**Pass**: No issues with missing alt text on images were identified in the provided examples.

## Best Practices

### 1. Use of `$scope`
**Pass**: The use of `$scope` was identified as an anti-pattern, and the suggestion to use `controllerAs` syntax was provided.

## Testing

### 1. Lack of Unit Tests
**Pass**: The lack of unit tests was identified, and an example of a simple unit test for `pageCtrl` was provided.

## Documentation

### 1. Lack of Comments
**Pass**: The lack of sufficient comments was identified, and the suggestion to add comments for clarity was provided.
