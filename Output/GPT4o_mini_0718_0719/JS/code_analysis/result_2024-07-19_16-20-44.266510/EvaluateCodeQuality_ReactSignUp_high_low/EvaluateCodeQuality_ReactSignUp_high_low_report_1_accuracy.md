# Evaluation Report

## Readability
### 1. Long Function Definitions
- **Pass**: The original `asyncValidate` function was lengthy and has been successfully broken down into smaller functions for improved clarity.

## Maintainability
### 1. Inline API Calls
- **Pass**: The API calls in `handleSubmit` have been extracted into a separate service, improving maintainability.
