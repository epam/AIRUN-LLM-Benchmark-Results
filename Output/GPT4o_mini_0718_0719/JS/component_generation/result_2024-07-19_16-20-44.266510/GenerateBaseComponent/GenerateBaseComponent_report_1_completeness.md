# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### 1. Confirm the component includes a search feature in the dropdown.
**Pass**: The component includes an input field within the dropdown for searching (`<input type="text" value={searchTerm} onChange={e => setSearchTerm(e.target.value)} placeholder="Search..." autoFocus />`).

### 2. Check that the component is navigable via keyboard.
**Pass**: The component handles keyboard events (`onKeyDown={handleKeyDown}`) and includes logic for `ArrowDown`, `ArrowUp`, `Enter`, and `Escape` keys.

### 3. Verify items in the dropdown can be selected by pressing the Enter key.
**Pass**: The `handleKeyDown` function includes logic to select an item when the `Enter` key is pressed (`if (highlightedIndex >= 0) { handleSelectOption(filteredOptions[highlightedIndex]); }`).

### 4. Confirm the dropdown list opens when Enter is pressed.
**Pass**: The `handleKeyDown` function includes logic to toggle the dropdown when the `Enter` key is pressed (`handleToggleDropdown();`).

### 5. Ensure the focus returns to the select component after the dropdown is closed.
**Fail**: The code does not explicitly handle returning focus to the select component after the dropdown is closed.

### 6. Verify the dropdown closes upon selecting an item via keyboard.
**Pass**: The `handleSelectOption` function sets `isOpen` to `false`, closing the dropdown (`setIsOpen(false);`).

### 7. Verify the dropdown closes upon selecting an item via mouse.
**Pass**: The `handleSelectOption` function is called on `onClick` event of the list item, which sets `isOpen` to `false`, closing the dropdown (`onClick={() => handleSelectOption(option)}`).

### 8. Confirm the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed.
**Pass**: The `handleKeyDown` function includes logic to close the dropdown when the `Escape` key is pressed (`setIsOpen(false);`).

### 9. Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component.
**Pass**: The `handleClickOutside` function closes the dropdown when a click is detected outside the component (`if (selectRef.current && !selectRef.current.contains(event.target as Node)) { setIsOpen(false); }`).
