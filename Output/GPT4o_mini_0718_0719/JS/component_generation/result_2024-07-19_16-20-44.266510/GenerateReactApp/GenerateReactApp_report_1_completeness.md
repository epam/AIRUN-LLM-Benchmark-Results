# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Ensure that the API call to https://swapi.dev/api/people is made using axios.
**Pass**: The code uses `axios.get('https://swapi.dev/api/people')` to fetch data from the SWAPI API.

### Step 2: Make sure the data is fetched initially without any input fields.
**Pass**: The data is fetched in the `useEffect` hook, which runs when the component mounts, without requiring any user input.

### Step 3: Ensure a loader or loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass**: The code uses a `loading` state to display a loading message (`<p>Loading...</p>`) while the data is being fetched.

### Step 4: Verify that errors are logged to the console if the API call fails.
**Pass**: The code includes a `catch` block in the `fetchCharacters` function that logs errors to the console using `console.error('Error fetching data:', error)`.

### Step 5: Ensure that the fetched characters are displayed in a list format.
**Pass**: The characters are displayed in a list format using an unordered list (`<ul>`) and list items (`<li>`).

### Step 6: Make sure each list item has a unique key derived from the character’s URL.
**Pass**: Each list item has a unique key derived from the character’s URL (`<li key={character.url}>`).
