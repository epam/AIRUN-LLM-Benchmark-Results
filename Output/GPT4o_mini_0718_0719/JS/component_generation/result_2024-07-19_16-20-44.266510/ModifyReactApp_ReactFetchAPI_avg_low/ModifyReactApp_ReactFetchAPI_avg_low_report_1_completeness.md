### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Check that a loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.**
   - **Pass**: The code includes a loading state (`loading`) and conditionally renders a "Loading..." message when `loading` is `true`.

2. **Verify that the loader does not hide the search input when data is loading.**
   - **Pass**: The search input is rendered outside the conditional block that displays the loading message, ensuring it remains visible.

3. **Validate that a request with an empty search term is sent on the initial render.**
   - **Pass**: The `useEffect` hook calls `fetchCharacters('')` on initial render, sending a request with an empty search term.

4. **Verify that the search input field is present.**
   - **Pass**: The search input field is present in the JSX with the appropriate attributes.

5. **Ensure that the character search functionality is implemented.**
   - **Pass**: The `handleSearchChange` function updates the search term and calls `fetchCharacters` with the new search term.

6. **Ensure that the API request includes the search term as a query parameter.**
   - **Pass**: The `fetchCharacters` function includes the search term as a query parameter in the API request.

7. **Validate that the data is loading on initial app load with empty query and then when the search term changes.**
   - **Pass**: The `useEffect` hook and `handleSearchChange` function ensure data is fetched on initial load and when the search term changes.

8. **Ensure that the debounced fetch function prevents unnecessary API requests.**
   - **Fail**: The current implementation does not include a debouncing mechanism to prevent unnecessary API requests.

9. **Confirm that the character list is updated based on the search results.**
   - **Pass**: The character list is updated by setting the `characters` state with the search results.

10. **Validate that the application handles API request errors.**
    - **Pass**: The `fetchCharacters` function includes a try-catch block to handle API request errors.

11. **Ensure that the user experience remains smooth without backend overloads.**
    - **Fail**: Without a debouncing mechanism, the user experience may suffer from backend overloads due to rapid successive API requests.
