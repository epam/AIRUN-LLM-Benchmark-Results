# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Pass**: Confirm that constraints related to local storage limitations are noted.
   - The report mentions that local storage has size limitations (typically around 5MB), which may restrict the number of todos a user can store.

2. **Pass**: Verify that assumptions about the application being designed for a single user are mentioned.
   - The report states that the application is designed for a single user, as it stores todos in the local storage of the user's browser.

3. **Pass**: Ensure that browser compatibility assumptions are included.
   - The report notes that the application relies on local storage, which may not be available in all browsers or may have limitations in older versions.

4. **Pass**: Check that performance-related constraints are noted.
   - The report discusses performance optimizations and scalability considerations, including the use of immutable data structures and the `shouldComponentUpdate` lifecycle method.

5. **Pass**: Confirm that performance optimizations, such as the use of `shouldComponentUpdate`, are identified.
   - The report explicitly mentions the use of the `shouldComponentUpdate` lifecycle method in the `TodoItem` component to optimize rendering.

6. **Pass**: Verify that considerations for using immutable data structures for performance are mentioned.
   - The report highlights the use of immutable data structures (via methods like `map`, `filter`, and `concat`) to maintain performance and predictability in state updates.

7. **Pass**: Ensure scalability considerations related to local storage limitations are discussed.
   - The report discusses the limitations of local storage and how it may restrict the number of todos a user can store, impacting scalability.

8. **Pass**: Check that the potential need for a backend service for better scalability is mentioned.
   - The report notes the absence of a backend and how it may limit scalability for larger datasets or multi-user scenarios.

9. **Pass**: Confirm that the evaluation steps are unambiguous and concise.
   - The evaluation steps are clear and concise, allowing for straightforward assessment.

10. **Pass**: Ensure that each step allows the evaluator to assess the output based solely on the provided code.
    - Each step is designed to be assessed based on the provided code and the corresponding report.

11. **Pass**: Verify that the steps are clearly articulated and cover all main points of the task.
    - The steps are well-articulated and cover all the main points, including constraints, assumptions, performance, and scalability considerations.
