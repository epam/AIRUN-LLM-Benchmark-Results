# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Confirm that the state slices for page and user are correctly defined and managed.
- **Pass**: The `pageSlice` is correctly defined with an initial state and reducers for setting and resetting the page state. However, there is no user slice defined in the provided code.

### Step 2: Verify that API service functions are correctly defined and used.
- **Pass**: The API service functions are correctly defined using `createApi` from `@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react`. The `getBlocks` query and `updateBlock` mutation are properly set up and exported.

### Step 3: Ensure that the application correctly handles all the functionalities from the original Angular code.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include all functionalities from the original Angular code. Specifically, functionalities like delete, tag management, and other CRUD operations are not present.

### Step 4: Verify that all functionalities like save, delete, update, and tag management are working correctly.
- **Fail**: The provided code only includes a basic save functionality in the `PageEditor` component. There is no implementation for delete, update, or tag management functionalities.

### Step 5: Ensure that the application performs all CRUD operations correctly.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not demonstrate all CRUD operations. Only the read operation (`getBlocks` query) and a placeholder for save operation are present. There is no implementation for create, update, or delete operations.

### Step 6: Verify that the application handles local storage and state persistence correctly.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include any implementation for handling local storage or state persistence.
