### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Unused Imports or Code**
   - **Pass**: All imports in the provided code are used and necessary for the functionality.

2. **Code Structure and Angular Style Guidelines**
   - **Pass**: The code follows Angular style guidelines, with components, services, and actions properly separated.

3. **Compatibility with Latest Angular and TypeScript**
   - **Pass**: The code uses modern Angular and TypeScript features, ensuring compatibility with the latest versions.

4. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**
   - **Pass**: The code does not contain any browser-specific features that would hinder compatibility with modern browsers.

5. **Console Errors and Warnings**
   - **Pass**: There are no apparent console errors or warnings in the provided code.

6. **Single Responsibility Principle**
   - **Pass**: The code is decomposed into components and services, each handling a single responsibility.

7. **DRY Principles**
   - **Pass**: The code does not contain any duplicate logic and follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.

8. **API Error Handling**
   - **Fail**: The `checkName` and `checkEmail` methods in `SignupComponent` use `catchError` to return `null` on error, but the `onSubmit` method does not handle API errors effectively. It only sets `submitting` to `false` without providing user feedback.

    - **Pass**: The signup form includes proper form validation and error messages, ensuring a good user experience.

11. **Signup Action Dispatch**
    - **Pass**: The signup action is correctly dispatched from the `SignupComponent` upon form submission.

12. **DOM Manipulation**
    - **Pass**: The application does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of Angular’s framework.

13. **Angular References for DOM Access**
    - **Pass**: The application does not overuse Angular references for DOM access, relying instead on Angular’s state and props.

14. **TODOs or Incomplete Parts**
    - **Pass**: There are no TODOs or incomplete parts in the provided code.
