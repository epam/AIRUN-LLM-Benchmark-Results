# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Verify that all React components and their functionalities are correctly translated into Angular components.**
   - **Pass**: The provided code includes Angular components (`SignupComponent`) and services (`ApiService`) that replicate the functionalities of the React components.

2. **Ensure that the form validation logic is implemented using Angular's reactive forms.**
   - **Pass**: The `signupForm` is created using Angular's `FormBuilder` and includes validation logic with `Validators`.

3. **Check that the application includes the necessary form controls and validation rules.**
   - **Pass**: The form controls for `name`, `email`, and `password` are present with appropriate validation rules (e.g., required, minLength, maxLength).

4. **Confirm that the application correctly binds the form controls and handles form submission.**
   - **Pass**: The form controls are bound using `formControlName`, and the form submission is handled by the `onSubmit` method.

5. **Ensure the application correctly displays form validation errors.**
   - **Pass**: The template includes logic to display validation errors using `*ngIf` and async pipes for `nameError$` and `emailError$`.

6. **Verify that the application contains actions for signup, signup success, and signup failure.**
   - **Fail**: The provided code does not include the `AuthActions` definitions or the `auth.effects.ts` file, which are necessary to handle signup actions and side effects.

7. **Ensure that the auth.effects.ts file correctly handles side effects using @ngrx/effects, including calling the API and dispatching success or failure actions.**
   - **Fail**: The `auth.effects.ts` file is not provided, so it cannot be verified if side effects are handled correctly.

8. **Validate that the API call to signup is correctly integrated and that the response is handled properly.**
   - **Pass**: The `ApiService` includes the `signup` method, and the `onSubmit` method in `SignupComponent` handles the API response correctly by dispatching actions and navigating on success.

9. **Confirm that the application navigates to the login page correctly when the link is clicked.**
   - **Pass**: The template includes a router link to the login page (`<a routerLink="/login">Already a member? Log in here.</a>`).
