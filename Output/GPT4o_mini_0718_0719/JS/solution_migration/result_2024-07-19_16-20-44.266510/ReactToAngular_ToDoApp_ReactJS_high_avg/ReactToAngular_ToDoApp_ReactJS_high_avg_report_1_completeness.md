# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Check that the main component displays the header with input for new todos.
- **Pass**: The `app.component.html` contains a header with an input field for new todos.

### Step 2: Ensure that adding a new todo item works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `handleNewTodoKeyDown` method in `AppComponent` dispatches the `addTodo` action when the Enter key is pressed, and the input field is cleared.

### Step 3: Verify that the todo list displays all added todo items.
- **Pass**: The `app.component.html` uses `*ngFor` to iterate over `todos$` and displays each todo item using the `app-todo-item` component.

### Step 4: Confirm that toggle functionality works for marking todos as completed.
- **Pass**: The `toggle` method in `AppComponent` dispatches the `toggle` action, and the `todoItem.component.html` emits the `toggle` event when the checkbox is changed.

### Step 5: Check that editing a todo item works and updates the todo item correctly.
- **Pass**: The `edit` method in `AppComponent` sets the `editing` property, and the `save` method dispatches the `save` action. The `todoItem.component.html` handles the edit mode and emits the `save` event.

### Step 6: Ensure that deleting a todo item removes it from the list.
- **Pass**: The `destroy` method in `AppComponent` dispatches the `destroy` action, and the `todoItem.component.html` emits the `destroy` event when the delete button is clicked.

### Step 7: Verify that the footer correctly displays the count of active items.
- **Pass**: The `app-todo-footer` component receives the count of active items via the `count` input property and displays it correctly in `footer.component.html`.

### Step 8: Confirm that the footer's clear completed button works and removes completed items.
- **Pass**: The `clearCompleted` method in `AppComponent` dispatches the `clearCompleted` action, and the `footer.component.html` emits the `clearCompleted` event when the button is clicked.

### Step 9: Check that filtering todos by "all", "active", and "completed" works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `nowShowing` property in `AppComponent` is updated based on the selected filter, and the `footer.component.html` correctly applies the `selected` class to the active filter.

### Step 10: Ensure that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `toggleAll` method in `AppComponent` dispatches the `toggleAll` action, and the `app.component.html` handles the change event for the "Mark all as complete" checkbox.

### Step 11: Check that the application persists todos to local storage and reloads them correctly.
- **Pass**: The `initialState` in `todo.reducer.ts` is loaded from local storage using `Utils.store('react-todos')`, ensuring that todos are persisted and reloaded correctly.
