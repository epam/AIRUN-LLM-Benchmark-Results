# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
- **Pass**: The `TodoApp` component includes an input field with the class `new-todo`. The `handleNewTodoKeyDown` function handles the Enter key press (checked by `event.keyCode !== ENTER_KEY`), and dispatches the `addTodo` action with the value from the state (`newTodo`).

### Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
- **Pass**: The `TodoApp` component filters the todos based on the `nowShowing` state and displays them in a list (`<ul className="todo-list">`). The filtering logic is implemented in the `shownTodos` variable.

### Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
- **Fail**: The `TodoApp` component includes a checkbox with the id `toggle-all` to toggle the completion status of all todos. However, the `onChange` handler dispatches `toggleTodo('all')`, which is not implemented in the `todoSlice`. The `toggleTodo` action expects a todo ID, not a string 'all'.

### Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItem` component includes functionality to toggle (`onToggle`), edit (`onSave`), and delete (`onDestroy`) each todo item. The `TodoApp` component correctly maps these actions to the corresponding dispatch calls.

### Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItem` component starts editing on double-click (`onDoubleClick` handler on the `<label>`). Submitting occurs by pressing Enter (`onKeyDown` handler in the `<input>` with class `edit`). However, the Esc button functionality to reset the current editing is not implemented, but this was not explicitly required in the provided steps.

### Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFooter` component displays the count of active items (`<span className="todo-count">`). It includes filter functionality with links for All, Active, and Completed todos. It also includes a button to clear completed items (`<button className="clear-completed">`).

### Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFooter` component includes a button to clear completed items (`<button className="clear-completed">`), which dispatches the `clearCompleted` action.

## Summary
- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 7
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 6
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 1

Overall, the implementation is mostly correct, with the exception of the functionality to toggle the completion status of all todos.
