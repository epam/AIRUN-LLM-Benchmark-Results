### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Pass**: Verify that the test suite includes a test to render the component without crashing.
   - The test `renders without crashing` verifies this by checking for the placeholder text.

2. **Pass**: Confirm that the test suite includes a test to open the menu when the control is clicked.
   - The test `opens the menu when focused` verifies this by focusing the input and checking for the presence of an option.

3. **Pass**: Ensure the test suite includes a test to display options when the menu is open.
   - The test `opens the menu when focused` also covers this by checking for the presence of an option when the menu is open.

4. **Pass**: Verify that the test suite includes a test to call the onChange callback when an option is selected.
   - The test `selects an option` verifies this by checking if `onChange` is called with the correct arguments.

5. **Fail**: Confirm that the test suite includes a test to display the selected option.
   - There is no explicit test that verifies the selected option is displayed.

6. **Pass**: Ensure that the test suite includes a test to clear the selected option when the clear indicator is clicked.
   - The test `clears the selected value` verifies this by checking if `onChange` is called with the correct arguments and the option is removed.

7. **Pass**: Verify that the test suite includes a test to filter options based on the input value.
   - The test `filters options based on input value` verifies this by checking that only the matching option is displayed.

8. **Pass**: Confirm that the test suite includes a test to display a loading message when the component is in a loading state.
   - The test `renders loading indicator when loading` verifies this by checking for the presence of the loading text.

9. **Pass**: Ensure that the test suite includes a test to display a "no options" message when there are no options available.
   - The test `renders no options message when no options available` verifies this by checking for the presence of the no options text.

10. **Pass**: Verify that all tests are written using React Testing Library's render, screen, and fireEvent methods.
    - All tests use `render`, `screen`, and `fireEvent` from React Testing Library.

11. **Pass**: Ensure that all tests use the expect function from Jest to assert outcomes.
    - All tests use `expect` from Jest for assertions.

12. **Pass**: Verify that the test for rendering the component checks for the presence of the placeholder text.
    - The test `renders without crashing` checks for the placeholder text.

13. **Fail**: Ensure that the test for opening the menu checks for the presence of the role listbox.
    - The test `opens the menu when focused` does not check for the role listbox.

14. **Pass**: Confirm that the test for displaying options checks for the presence of option texts.
    - The test `opens the menu when focused` checks for the presence of option texts.

15. **Pass**: Ensure that the test for calling onChange verifies the correct arguments are passed to the callback.
    - The test `selects an option` verifies the correct arguments are passed to `onChange`.

16. **Fail**: Verify that the test for displaying the selected option checks for the presence of the option text.
    - There is no explicit test that verifies the selected option is displayed.

17. **Pass**: Ensure that the test for clearing the selected option verifies the correct arguments are passed to the onChange callback.
    - The test `clears the selected value` verifies the correct arguments are passed to `onChange`.

18. **Pass**: Confirm that the test for filtering options verifies that only matching options are displayed.
    - The test `filters options based on input value` verifies that only matching options are displayed.

19. **Pass**: Ensure that the test for displaying the loading message checks for the presence of the loading text.
    - The test `renders loading indicator when loading` checks for the presence of the loading text.

20. **Pass**: Verify that the test for displaying the "no options" message checks for the presence of the no options text.
    - The test `renders no options message when no options available` checks for the presence of the no options text.
