# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Ensure that the API call to https://swapi.dev/api/people is made using axios.
**Pass**: The API call is made using axios in the `fetchCharacters` function within the `useEffect` hook.

### Step 2: Make sure the data is fetched initially without any input fields.
**Pass**: The data is fetched initially without any input fields. The `useEffect` hook ensures the data is fetched when the component mounts.

### Step 3: Ensure a loader or loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass**: A loading indicator (`<div>Loading...</div>`) is displayed while data is being fetched, controlled by the `isLoading` state.

### Step 4: Verify that errors are logged to the console if the API call fails.
**Fail**: There is no error handling in the `fetchCharacters` function to log errors to the console if the API call fails.

### Step 5: Ensure that the fetched characters are displayed in a list format.
**Pass**: The fetched characters are displayed in a list format using an unordered list (`<ul>`) and list items (`<li>`).

### Step 6: Make sure each list item has a unique key derived from the character’s URL.
**Pass**: Each list item has a unique key derived from the character’s URL (`<li key={character.url}>`).

### Summary
- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 6
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 5
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 1

### Recommendations
To address the failed step, add error handling in the `fetchCharacters` function to log errors to the console if the API call fails. Here is an example of how you can do it:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchCharacters = async () => {
    setIsLoading(true);
    try {
      const response = await axios.get('https://swapi.dev/api/people');
      setCharacters(response.data.results);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error fetching characters:', error);
    } finally {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }
  };

  fetchCharacters();
}, []);
```

This will ensure that any errors during the API call are logged to the console.
