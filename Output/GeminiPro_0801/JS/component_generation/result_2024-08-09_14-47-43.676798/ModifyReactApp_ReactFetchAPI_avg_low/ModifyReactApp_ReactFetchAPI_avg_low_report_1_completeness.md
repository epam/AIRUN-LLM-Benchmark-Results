# Evaluation Report

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Check that a loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.**
   - **Pass**: The code includes a loading state (`loading`) and displays a "Loading..." message when `loading` is `true`.

2. **Verify that the loader does not hide the search input when data is loading.**
   - **Pass**: The search input is always visible regardless of the loading state.

3. **Validate that a request with an empty search term is sent on the initial render.**
   - **Pass**: On initial render, `searchTerm` is an empty string, and a request is sent with this empty search term.

4. **Verify that the search input field is present.**
   - **Pass**: The search input field is present in the JSX.

5. **Ensure that the character search functionality is implemented.**
   - **Pass**: The search functionality is implemented by updating the `searchTerm` state and making an API request with the search term.

6. **Ensure that the API request includes the search term as a query parameter.**
   - **Pass**: The API request includes the search term as a query parameter (`params: { search: searchTerm }`).

7. **Validate that the data is loading on initial app load with empty query and then when the search term changes.**
   - **Pass**: The data is fetched on initial load with an empty query and whenever the `searchTerm` changes.

8. **Ensure that the debounced fetch function prevents unnecessary API requests.**
   - **Pass**: The use of `setTimeout` with a 300ms delay ensures that the fetch function is debounced.

9. **Confirm that the character list is updated based on the search results.**
   - **Pass**: The character list is updated based on the search results by setting the `characters` state.

10. **Validate that the application handles API request errors.**
    - **Pass**: The application handles API request errors by catching them and logging an error message.

11. **Ensure that the user experience remains smooth without backend overloads.**
    - **Pass**: The debounced fetch function helps in preventing backend overloads, ensuring a smooth user experience.
