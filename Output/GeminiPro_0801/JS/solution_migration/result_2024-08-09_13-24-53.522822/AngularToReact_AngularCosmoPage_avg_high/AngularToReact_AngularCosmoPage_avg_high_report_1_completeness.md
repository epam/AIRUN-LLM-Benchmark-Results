# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps:

1. **Confirm that the state slices for page and user are correctly defined and managed.**
    - **Pass**: The `pageSlice` and `usersSlice` are correctly defined using `createSlice` from `@reduxjs/toolkit`. They include initial states, reducers, and actions for setting and resetting the state.

2. **Verify that API service functions are correctly defined and used.**
    - **Pass**: The `restApi` service is correctly defined using `createApi` from `@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react`. It includes various endpoints for fetching, updating, adding, and deleting data related to blocks, comments, content, files, menus, modules, themes, users, etc.

3. **Ensure that the application correctly handles all the functionalities from the original Angular code.**
    - **Pass**: The `PageEditor` component handles functionalities such as fetching content, updating content, adding content, deleting content, and managing tags. It also includes state management for page and user data, similar to the original Angular code.

4. **Verify that all functionalities like save, delete, update, and tag management are working correctly.**
    - **Pass**: The `PageEditor` component includes functions for saving, deleting, and updating pages. It also handles tag management by fetching, adding, and deleting tags. The component uses hooks from `restApi` to perform these operations.

5. **Ensure that the application performs all CRUD operations correctly.**
    - **Pass**: The `restApi` service includes endpoints for all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for various entities like content, blocks, comments, files, menus, modules, themes, and users. The `PageEditor` component uses these endpoints to perform CRUD operations on content.

6. **Verify that the application handles local storage and state persistence correctly.**
    - **Pass**: The `PageEditor` component includes functions for saving to and loading from local storage. It checks for unsaved changes and allows the user to load or discard local versions of the page data. The component also updates the state using `useAppSelector` and `useAppDispatch` hooks.
