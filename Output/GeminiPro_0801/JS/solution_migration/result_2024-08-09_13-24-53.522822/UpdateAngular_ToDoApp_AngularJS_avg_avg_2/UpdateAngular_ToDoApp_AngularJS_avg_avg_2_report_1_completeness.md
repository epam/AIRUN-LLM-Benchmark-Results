# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Confirm that the application initializes correctly and loads persisted todos.
- **Pass**: The `AppComponent` initializes the state by selecting todos and done count from the store. The `TodoService` provides initial todos, and the `TodoEffects` handles loading todos.

### Step 2: Ensure that the todo list displays correctly and is interactive.
- **Pass**: The `TodoListComponent` uses `@Input` to receive todos and `@Output` to emit events for toggling, editing, and removing todos. The `AppComponent` handles these events and dispatches corresponding actions.

### Step 3: Verify that adding a new todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoInputComponent` emits an `add` event with the new todo title, which is handled by the `AppComponent` to dispatch the `addTodo` action.

### Step 4: Check that editing a todo works correctly.
- **Fail**: The `AppComponent` has an `editTodo` method, but it does not dispatch the `editTodo` action. The `TodoListComponent` emits an `edit` event, but it is not handled in the `AppComponent`.

### Step 5: Confirm that toggling a todo itemâ€™s completion status works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoListComponent` emits a `toggle` event, which is handled by the `AppComponent` to dispatch the `toggleTodo` action.

### Step 6: Ensure that removing a todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoListComponent` emits a `remove` event, which is handled by the `AppComponent` to dispatch the `removeTodo` action.

### Step 7: Verify that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFooterComponent` emits a `markAll` event, which is handled by the `AppComponent` to dispatch the `markAllTodos` action.

### Step 8: Check that the filter functionality (All, Active, Completed) works.
- **Fail**: There is no implementation for filtering todos based on their completion status in the provided code.

### Step 9: Confirm that the "Clear completed" button works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFooterComponent` emits a `clearCompleted` event, which is handled by the `AppComponent` to dispatch the `clearCompletedTodos` action.

### Step 10: Ensure that the application is responsive and functions correctly on different screen sizes.
- **Pass**: The components use Angular's standard practices for templates and styles, which should ensure basic responsiveness. However, specific responsive design details are not provided in the code.

## Summary

- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 10
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 8
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 2

Overall, the application is mostly functional with a few missing features, such as editing todos and filtering functionality.
