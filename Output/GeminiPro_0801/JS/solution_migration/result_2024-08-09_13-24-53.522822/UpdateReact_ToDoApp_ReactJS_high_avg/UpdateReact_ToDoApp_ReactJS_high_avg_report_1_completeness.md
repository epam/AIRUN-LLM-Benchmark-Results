# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
- **Pass**: The `TodoInput` component includes an input field and a form submission handler (`handleSubmit`) that dispatches the `addTodo` action when the Enter key is pressed.

### Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
- **Pass**: The `TodoList` component uses the `selectVisibleTodos` selector to display todos according to the current filter.

### Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
- **Fail**: The `TodoList` component includes a checkbox for "Mark all as complete," but there is no implementation to handle the toggling of all todos' completion status.

### Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItem` component includes functionality to toggle (`onToggle`), edit (`handleEditStart`, `handleEditSave`, `handleEditCancel`), and delete (`onDestroy`) each todo item.

### Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItem` component handles editing with a double click (`handleEditStart`), submitting with Enter (`handleEditSave`), and resetting with Esc (`handleEditCancel`).

### Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFilter` component displays the count of active items, includes filter links, and has a button to clear completed items.

### Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
- **Fail**: The `TodoFilter` component includes a "Clear completed" button, but there is no implementation to dispatch an action to clear completed items.
