# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Verify the application contains a button container with "Notes" and "Letters" buttons.
**Pass**: The application contains a button container with "Notes" and "Letters" buttons, as seen in the `btn-container` div.

### Step 2: Verify the application renders piano keys for both natural and sharp notes.
**Pass**: The application renders piano keys for both natural and sharp notes. Natural notes are rendered in the main piano div, and sharp notes are rendered in the `keys-sharp` div.

### Step 3: Verify clicking on a piano key plays the correct sound and highlights the key.
**Fail**: The `handleClick` function calls `play(note)` and `resetActive(note)` immediately, which means the key will not stay highlighted. Additionally, the `play` function uses `event.key.toUpperCase()`, which may not match the keys in `soundMapper`.

### Step 4: Verify releasing the mouse button or moving the cursor out of the key stops the sound and removes the highlight.
**Fail**: The current implementation does not handle mouse button release or cursor movement out of the key to stop the sound and remove the highlight.

### Step 5: Verify pressing and releasing keyboard keys play and stop the corresponding piano notes.
**Fail**: The `handleKeyDown` and `handleKeyUp` functions use `event.key.toUpperCase()`, which may not match the keys in `soundMapper`. Additionally, the `resetActive` function is called immediately after `play`, which may not allow the sound to play correctly.

### Step 6: Verify clicking the "Notes" button displays note names on the keys.
**Pass**: Clicking the "Notes" button toggles the `showLetters` state, which controls the display of note names on the keys.

### Step 7: Verify clicking the "Letters" button displays letter names on the keys.
**Pass**: Clicking the "Letters" button toggles the `showLetters` state, which controls the display of letter names on the keys.

### Step 8: Verify the fullscreen button toggles fullscreen mode for the application.
**Pass**: The `handleFullscreen` function correctly toggles fullscreen mode for the application.

### Step 9: Verify the application correctly handles simultaneous multiple key presses.
**Fail**: The current implementation does not handle simultaneous multiple key presses correctly. The `play` function prevents playing the same note if it is already in the `played` array, but it does not handle multiple keys being pressed simultaneously.

## Summary

- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 9
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 5
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 4

Overall, the application has several issues that need to be addressed to fully meet the evaluation criteria.
