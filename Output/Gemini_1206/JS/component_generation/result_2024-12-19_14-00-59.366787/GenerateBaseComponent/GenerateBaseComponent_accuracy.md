# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.
**Pass**: All imports (`useState`, `useRef`, `useEffect`, `KeyboardEvent`, `FocusEvent`) are used in the code.

### Step 2: Ensure the codebase is structured and follows TypeScript and React best practices (state, hooks, effects).
**Pass**: The code is well-structured, uses TypeScript interfaces, and follows React best practices with hooks and effects.

### Step 3: Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.
**Pass**: The use of `useEffect` is appropriate and does not indicate any memory leaks or unnecessary re-renders.

### Step 4: Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.
**Pass**: The code is compatible with the latest versions of React and TypeScript.

### Step 5: Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.
**Pass**: There are no apparent console errors or warnings in the provided code.

### Step 6: Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.
**Pass**: The app uses React state (`searchTerm`) to manage the value of the text field.

### Step 7: Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React virtual DOM.
**Pass**: The app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React's virtual DOM.

### Step 8: Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React state and props.
