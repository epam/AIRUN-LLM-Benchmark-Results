# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that a loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass**: The code sets `loading` to `true` before making the API request and displays "Loading..." when `loading` is `true`.

### Step 2: Verify that the loader does not hide the search input when data is loading.
**Pass**: The search input is always displayed regardless of the loading state.

### Step 3: Validate that a request with an empty search term is sent on the initial render.
**Pass**: The `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array calls `fetchCharacters('')` on initial render.

### Step 4: Verify that the search input field is present.
**Pass**: The search input field is present in the JSX with the placeholder "Search characters".

### Step 5: Ensure that the character search functionality is implemented.
**Pass**: The search functionality is implemented using the `handleSearchChange` function which updates the `search` state.

### Step 6: Ensure that the API request includes the search term as a query parameter.
**Pass**: The `fetchCharacters` function constructs the API URL with the search term as a query parameter.

### Step 7: Validate that the data is loading on initial app load with empty query and then when the search term changes.
**Pass**: The initial load fetches data with an empty query, and subsequent changes to the search term trigger the debounced fetch function.

### Step 8: Ensure that the debounced fetch function prevents unnecessary API requests.
**Pass**: The `debouncedFetchCharacters` function uses `debounce` to limit the frequency of API requests.

### Step 9: Confirm that the character list is updated based on the search results.
**Pass**: The character list is updated by setting the `characters` state with the results from the API response.

### Step 10: Validate that the application handles API request errors.
**Pass**: The `fetchCharacters` function includes a `try-catch` block to handle and log errors.

### Step 11: Ensure that the user experience remains smooth without backend overloads.
**Pass**: The use of `debounce` ensures that the backend is not overloaded with frequent API requests.
