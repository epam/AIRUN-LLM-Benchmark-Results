# Evaluation Report

**Evaluation Steps:**

1. **Pass**: Confirm that constraints related to local storage limitations are noted.
    - The answer mentions that local storage has size limits (usually around 5-10MB), so the application may not be suitable for managing extremely large todo lists.

2. **Pass**: Verify that assumptions about the application being designed for a single user are mentioned.
    - The answer states that the application is intended for individual use and there are no features for collaboration or sharing todo lists.

3. **Pass**: Ensure that browser compatibility assumptions are included.
    - The answer notes that the application is designed to run in a web browser environment and relies on browser features like local storage.

4. **Pass**: Check that performance-related constraints are noted.
    - The answer discusses performance optimizations and constraints, such as the use of `shouldComponentUpdate` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

5. **Pass**: Confirm that performance optimizations, such as the use of `shouldComponentUpdate`, are identified.
    - The answer explicitly mentions the use of `shouldComponentUpdate` in `TodoItem` to improve performance.

6. **Fail**: Verify that considerations for using immutable data structures for performance are mentioned.
    - The answer does not mention the use of immutable data structures for performance.

7. **Pass**: Ensure scalability considerations related to local storage limitations are discussed.
    - The answer discusses the limitations of local storage and the potential need for a backend for better scalability.

8. **Pass**: Check that the potential need for a backend service for better scalability is mentioned.
    - The answer mentions that for a more scalable solution, a backend database and API would be needed.

9. **Pass**: Confirm that the evaluation steps are unambiguous and concise.
    - The evaluation steps are clear and concise.

10. **Pass**: Ensure that each step allows the evaluator to assess the output based solely on the provided code.
    - Each step is designed to be assessed based on the provided code analysis.

11. **Pass**: Verify that the steps are clearly articulated and cover all main points of the task.
    - The steps are clearly articulated and cover the main points of the task.

**Summary:**

- Total number of steps evaluated: 11
- Number of passed steps: 10
- Number of failed steps: 1
