# Evaluation Report

## Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
**Pass**: The `TodoInput` component includes an input field that listens for the Enter key press and dispatches the `addTodo` action with the value from the state.

## Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
**Pass**: The `TodoList` component uses the `getFilteredTodos` function to filter todos based on the current filter state and displays them accordingly.

## Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
**Pass**: The `ToggleAll` component includes a checkbox that, when changed, dispatches the `toggleAllTodos` action to toggle the completion status of all todos.

## Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
**Pass**: The `TodoItem` component includes functionality to toggle (`handleToggle`), edit (`handleEditStart`, `handleEditChange`, `handleEditEnd`, `handleEditKeyDown`), and delete (`handleDelete`) each todo item.

## Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
**Pass**: The `TodoItem` component starts editing on double click (`handleEditStart`), submits the edited todo on Enter key press (`handleEditKeyDown`), and resets the editing on Esc key press (`handleEditKeyDown`).

## Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
**Pass**: The `Footer` component displays the count of active items (`activeTodoCount`), includes filter links (`setFilter`), and has a button to clear completed items (`handleClearCompleted`).

## Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
**Pass**: The `Footer` component includes a button that, when clicked, dispatches the `clearCompletedTodos` action to clear completed items.
