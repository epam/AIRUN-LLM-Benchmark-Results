    - **Pass**: The application uses `createSlice` from Redux Toolkit for these actions and reducers.

24. **Confirm the use of `nanoid` for generating unique IDs.**
    - **Pass**: The application uses `nanoid` for generating unique IDs.

25. **Check that the code includes a `Provider` wrapping the entire application.**
