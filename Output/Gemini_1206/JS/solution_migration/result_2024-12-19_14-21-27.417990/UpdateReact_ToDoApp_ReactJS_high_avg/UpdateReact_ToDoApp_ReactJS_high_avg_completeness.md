# Evaluation Report

## Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
**Pass**: The input field for creating a new todo is present in the `App` component. The `handleNewTodoKeyDown` function handles the Enter key press and dispatches the `addTodo` action to the store.

## Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
**Pass**: The `App` component filters the todos based on the current filter (`nowShowing`) and displays them in a list.

## Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
**Pass**: The `App` component includes a checkbox that toggles the completion status of all todos via the `handleToggleAll` function, which dispatches the `toggleAll` action.

## Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
**Pass**: The `TodoItem` component includes functionality to toggle, edit, and delete each todo item. The `onToggle`, `onDestroy`, and `onSave` props handle these actions respectively.

## Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
**Pass**: The `TodoItem` component handles editing with a double click (`handleEdit`), submitting with Enter (`handleKeyDown`), and resetting with Esc (`handleKeyDown`).

## Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
**Pass**: The `TodoFooter` component displays the count of active items, includes filter functionality, and has a button to clear completed items.

## Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
**Pass**: The `TodoFooter` component includes a button to clear completed items, which dispatches the `clearCompleted` action.
