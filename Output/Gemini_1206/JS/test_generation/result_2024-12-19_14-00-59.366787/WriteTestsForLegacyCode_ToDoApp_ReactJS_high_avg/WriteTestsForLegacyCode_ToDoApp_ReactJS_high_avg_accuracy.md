# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that the tests are isolated and do not depend on each other.
**Pass**: Each test case is independent and uses `beforeEach` and `afterEach` to set up and tear down the environment, ensuring isolation.

### Step 2: Validate that the tests adhere to best practices for unit testing.
**Pass**: The tests follow best practices such as using `jest.mock` for mocking dependencies, using `beforeEach` for setup, and `afterEach` for cleanup.

### Step 3: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
**Pass**: The code does not contain any noticeable duplicates and follows the DRY principle effectively.

### Step 4: Verify the test framework and libraries are chosen and listed appropriately.
**Pass**: The test framework and libraries used are `jest`, `@testing-library/react`, and `user-event`, which are appropriate for React unit testing.

### Step 5: Confirm the testing environment setup is included.
**Pass**: The setup for the testing environment is included with `jest.mock` and `beforeEach` setup.

### Step 6: Ensure the testing environment configuration file is present.
**Fail**: The provided code does not include a configuration file for the testing environment.

### Step 7: Validate the setup for the test environment is included.
**Pass**: The setup for the test environment is included in the `beforeEach` and `jest.mock` calls.

### Step 8: Ensure the tests cover at least 80% of the codebase.
**Fail**: The provided code does not include coverage reports, so it is not possible to confirm if the tests cover at least 80% of the codebase.

### Step 9: Confirm that mocking is used for dependencies where necessary.
**Pass**: Mocking is used appropriately for `react-dom` and other dependencies.

### Step 10: Verify that the generated code does not contain any TODOs.
**Pass**: The code does not contain any TODOs.
