# Evaluation Report

## Readability

### 1. Inconsistent Naming and Formatting in `rest.js`
**Pass**: The code uses consistent naming conventions for variables and functions (e.g., camelCase for JavaScript).

### 2. Magic Strings in `pageCtrl.js`
**Pass**: Hardcoded strings are identified and replaced with constants to improve maintainability.

## Maintainability

### 1. `rest.js` lacks modularity
**Pass**: The suggestion to split resources into separate modules or services improves maintainability.

### 2. `pageCtrl.js` is Overly Complex
**Pass**: The suggestion to break down the `savePage` function into smaller, single-responsibility functions is valid.

## Performance

### 1. Deeply Nested Callback Structure in `pageCtrl.js`
**Pass**: The suggestion to use promises or async/await to flatten the structure is appropriate.

## Accessibility

### 1. Missing Labels for Inputs in `page.html`
**Pass**: The suggestion to use `<label for="id">` elements to associate labels with inputs improves accessibility.

## Best Practices

### 1. Use of `$scope` in `pageCtrl.js`
**Pass**: The suggestion to use the `controller as` syntax or the `vm` (view model) approach is a best practice for better code organization.

## Testing

### 1. Difficult to Test `pageCtrl.js`
**Pass**: The suggestion to use dependency injection effectively to make testing easier is valid.

## Documentation

### 1. Inconsistent and Insufficient Comments
**Pass**: The suggestion to use JSDoc style comments for functions to document parameters and return values is appropriate.
