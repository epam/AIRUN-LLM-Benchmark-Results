### Step 2: Ensure the codebase is structured and follows TypeScript and React best practices (state, hooks, effects).
**Pass** - The codebase is well-structured and follows best practices for using state, hooks, and effects.

### Step 3: Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.

### Step 7: Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React virtual DOM.
**Pass** - The app does not manipulate the DOM directly outside of React's virtual DOM.

### Step 8: Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React state and props.
