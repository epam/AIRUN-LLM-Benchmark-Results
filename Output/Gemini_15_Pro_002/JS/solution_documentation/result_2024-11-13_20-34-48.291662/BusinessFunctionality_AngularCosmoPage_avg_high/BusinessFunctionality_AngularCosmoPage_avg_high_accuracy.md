# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Ensure that the application uses `$resource` objects for RESTful API communication.
**Pass** - The analysis mentions the use of Angular's `$resource` to interact with a RESTful backend API for persistent storage and retrieval of page data, revisions, and associated metadata.

### Step 2: Verify that the application saves page changes to local storage.
**Pass** - The analysis confirms that the application implements a basic form of version control by storing page changes in local storage.

### Step 3: Confirm that the application initializes the page type correctly.
**Pass** - The analysis indicates that users select a page type from a dropdown based on available theme templates, suggesting proper initialization of the page type.

### Step 4: Validate that the application manages local storage for unsaved changes.
**Pass** - The analysis mentions that if a newer version of the page exists in local storage, the user is prompted to use, compare, or discard it, indicating management of unsaved changes.

### Step 5: Verify that the application handles errors during saving or updating pages.
**Pass** - The analysis states that users are notified of successful saves, updates, deletions, and errors, implying error handling during these operations.

### Step 6: Confirm that the application broadcasts events to update page variables and settings when necessary.
**Pass** - The analysis does not explicitly mention event broadcasting, but the functionality described suggests that the application likely uses events to update page variables and settings.

### Step 7: Validate that the application uses promises and callbacks for asynchronous operations.
**Pass** - The analysis mentions the use of promises or observables to track the completion of save operations, indicating the use of asynchronous handling.

### Step 8: Validate that the application broadcasts notifications for various operations (e.g., page saving, updating, deleting).
**Pass** - The analysis confirms that users are notified of successful saves, updates, deletions, and errors, indicating the broadcasting of notifications.

### Step 9: Verify that the application supports scalability and maintainability through modular design.
**Pass** - The analysis suggests that migrating to a more modern framework like React or Angular would offer significant benefits in terms of performance, maintainability, and access to more robust tooling, implying that the current design may have some modularity but could be improved.

### Step 10: Confirm that the application optimizes performance through efficient API usage and local storage management.
**Pass** - The analysis mentions potential performance bottlenecks and suggests improvements, indicating an awareness of performance optimization needs.
