# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Verify that the code implements a signup form for a React application using Redux and `redux-form`.
**Pass** - The code implements a signup form using React and integrates with Redux Form.

### Step 2: Check for synchronous and asynchronous validation of form fields.
**Pass** - The code performs both synchronous and asynchronous validation of form fields.

### Step 3: Confirm the presence of synchronous validation for name, email, and password fields.
**Pass** - Synchronous validation is present for name, email, and password fields.

### Step 4: Ensure that asynchronous validation checks if the name and email are already in use via API calls.
**Pass** - Asynchronous validation checks for the uniqueness of the name and email via API calls.

### Step 5: Ensure the form submission sends user data (name, email, password) to the backend API.
**Pass** - The form submission sends user data (name, email, password) to the backend API.

### Step 6: Verify that successful signup dispatches an action to update the application state.
**Pass** - Successful signup dispatches an action to update the application state.

### Step 7: Check that real-time feedback on form validation errors is provided.
**Pass** - Real-time feedback on form validation errors is provided.

### Step 8: Ensure success or error messages are displayed based on form submission results.
**Pass** - Success or error messages are displayed based on form submission results.

### Step 9: Confirm the presence of a link for existing users to navigate to the login page.
**Pass** - There is a link for existing users to navigate to the login page.

### Step 10: Determine if users can enter their name, email, and password into input fields.
**Pass** - Users can enter their name, email, and password into input fields.

### Step 11: Verify that real-time validation feedback is provided as users fill out the form.
**Pass** - Real-time validation feedback is provided as users fill out the form.

### Step 12: Check if the form submission process includes displaying validation errors or success messages.
**Pass** - The form submission process includes displaying validation errors or success messages.

### Step 13: Assess if the code enables new users to create an account on the platform.
**Pass** - The code enables new users to create an account on the platform.

### Step 14: Check if user information (name, email, password) is collected for account creation.
**Pass** - User information (name, email, password) is collected for account creation.

### Step 15: Determine if the code encourages user engagement by highlighting platform benefits.
**Fail** - The code does not explicitly highlight platform benefits to encourage user engagement.

### Step 16: Verify that the code ensures data integrity by validating user inputs both synchronously and asynchronously.
**Pass** - The code ensures data integrity by validating user inputs both synchronously and asynchronously.

### Step 17: Ensure it prevents duplicate accounts by checking for existing email or name.
**Pass** - The code prevents duplicate accounts by checking for existing email or name.
