### Step 9: Ensure the application has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.
- **Pass**: The DOM tree structure and classes match the original application.

### Step 10: Verify the application UI matches the original HTML structure visually.
- **Pass**: The application UI should match the original HTML structure visually.
