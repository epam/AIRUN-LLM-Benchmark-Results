# Evaluation Report

## Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
**Pass**: The input field for creating a new todo is present. The `handleKeyDown` function handles the Enter key press, dispatching the `addTodo` action with the new todo text from the state.

## Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
**Pass**: The `filteredTodos` array is derived from the `todos` state and the current `filter` state. The filtered todos are displayed in the `ul` element within the `main` section.

## Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
**Pass**: The `handleToggleAll` function dispatches the `toggleAllTodos` action, which toggles the completion status of all todos based on the checkbox state.

## Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
**Pass**: Each `TodoItem` component has functionality to toggle (`handleToggle`), edit (`handleEditStart`, `handleEditChange`, `handleEditKeyDown`, `handleEditEnd`), and delete (`handleDestroy`) a todo item.

## Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
**Pass**: The `handleEditStart` function starts editing on double click. The `handleEditKeyDown` function handles Enter to submit and Esc to reset the editing state.

## Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
**Pass**: The footer displays the count of active items using the `todo-count` span. The filter functionality is implemented with the `filters` list. The `handleClearCompleted` function allows clearing completed items.

## Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
**Pass**: The footer includes a "Clear completed" button that dispatches the `clearCompletedTodos` action when clicked.
