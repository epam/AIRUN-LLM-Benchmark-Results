# Evaluation Report

## Readability

### 1. Verbose `setState` in `componentDidMount` for Router
- **Pass**: The use of arrow functions instead of `setState.bind` improves readability and conciseness.

### 2. `ReactDOM.findDOMNode` for input value access
- **Pass**: Replacing `ReactDOM.findDOMNode` with `React.createRef()` and controlled components is a more idiomatic and maintainable approach in React.

### 3. `Utils.extend` can be replaced with object spread syntax
- **Pass**: Using the object spread syntax is more concise and readable than a custom `extend` function for shallow merging objects.

## Maintainability

### 1. String Refs are deprecated
- **Pass**: Replacing string refs with `React.createRef()` improves type safety and avoids potential issues associated with string refs.

### 2. Basic Router Implementation
- **Pass**: Using `react-router-dom` provides a more robust and feature-rich routing solution, improving maintainability and scalability.

### 3. Class Components for Simple UI
- **Pass**: Converting `TodoFooter` to a functional component makes it more concise and easier to understand.

## Performance

### 1. Binding in `render` method
- **Pass**: Using class property arrow functions for event handlers avoids unnecessary function re-creation and can improve performance.

## Accessibility

### 1. Missing `htmlFor` attribute in labels
- **Pass**: Ensuring all labels are correctly associated with their inputs using `htmlFor` and `id` attributes improves accessibility.

### 2. `href="#"` for navigation
- **Pass**: Using `<Link>` from `react-router-dom` provides proper semantic navigation and avoids accessibility issues associated with `href="#"`.

## Best Practices

### 1. Usage of `var` keyword
- **Pass**: Replacing `var` with `const` and `let` improves code clarity and reduces the risk of scope-related errors.

### 2. Lack of Type Safety for Event Handlers
- **Pass**: Using more specific event types like `React.KeyboardEvent<HTMLInputElement>` and `React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>` improves type safety.

## Testing

### 1. Testability of Class Components
- **Pass**: Functional components with hooks are often considered easier to test, leading to simpler and more focused tests.

### 2. Lack of Unit Tests
- **Pass**: Writing unit tests for React components and the `TodoModel` is crucial for ensuring code quality and preventing regressions.

## Documentation

### 1. Good Comments in Code
- **Pass**: The existing comments are helpful. Continue to add comments to explain complex logic and the purpose of functions and components.

### 2. Missing Component and Prop Descriptions
- **Pass**: Adding JSDoc-style comments for components and props provides a structured way to document the component's purpose, props, and methods.
