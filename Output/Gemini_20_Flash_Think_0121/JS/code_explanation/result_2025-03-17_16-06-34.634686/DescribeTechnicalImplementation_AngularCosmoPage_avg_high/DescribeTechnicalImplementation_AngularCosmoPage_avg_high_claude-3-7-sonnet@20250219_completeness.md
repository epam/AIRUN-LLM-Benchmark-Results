# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation includes a comprehensive component overview explaining the purpose and architecture
  
  The documentation provides a thorough explanation of the component's purpose as part of a CMS built with AngularJS. It clearly describes the architecture, identifying all key components (REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, Page Controller, and Page View) and explaining how they interact in an MVC-like architecture.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all major components (REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and Page controller) are documented
  
  All major components are well-documented in the technical documentation:
  - REST.js is described with its API endpoints and methods
  - Page.js is explained with its properties and purpose
  - Users.js is documented with its properties and role
  - PageCtrl.js is thoroughly documented with its methods and functionality

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure all significant features of the page management system are described
  
  The documentation covers all significant features including REST API communication, page data management, user data management, page editing UI, local storage for unsaved changes, URL auto-generation, tag autocomplete, page saving/duplication, and page deletion.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all form inputs and their behavior are documented
  
  The documentation includes detailed descriptions of all form inputs in the Page Editor section, including:
  - Page Type Select
  - Title Input with automatic URL generation
  - Description Textarea
  - Tags Input with autocomplete
  - URL Input
  - Publish Status Radio Buttons
  - Schedule Date Input
  
  Each input's binding and behavior (like events triggered on changes) is explained.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the documentation explains the page versioning and revision system
  
  The documentation explains the local version management system (storage of unsaved changes in localStorage) and mentions that the code interacts with revision endpoints. However, it doesn't provide a complete end-to-end explanation of how the full revision system works, which is why I'm not 100% confident in this evaluation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation covers the tag system and autocomplete functionality
  
  The tag system and autocomplete functionality are thoroughly documented, including:
  - The autocompleteTags() function that fetches suggestions
  - The selectSuggestion() function that handles selection
  - How tags are stored and updated
  - The UI components for displaying tag suggestions

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure the documentation includes explanation of error handling and user notifications
  
  The documentation mentions broadcasting 'notify' events with success messages for various operations like saving, updating, and deleting pages. It also mentions validation checks before saving pages. However, it doesn't go into extensive detail about how errors are displayed to users, which is why my confidence is slightly reduced.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page publishing workflow including scheduling
  
  The documentation clearly explains the page publishing workflow, including:
  - Different publish statuses ('Y', 'N', 'schedule')
  - How scheduled dates are handled
  - Logic for determining when to publish content based on scheduled dates
  - UI components for selecting publish status and schedule date

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation details how content extras and additional metadata are managed
  
  The documentation explains how the Page's extras are managed, including:
  - How extras are stored in the Page factory
  - Functions to save extras (saveExtrasPromise)
  - How extras are deleted and recreated during page updates
  - How extras are associated with revisions

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation explains how the UI interacts with the backend APIs
  
  The documentation provides a detailed explanation of how the UI interacts with backend APIs through the REST factory, including:
  - How the REST factory is structured
  - The API endpoints available
  - How controllers use these endpoints to perform CRUD operations
  - The sequence of API calls for operations like saving, updating, and deleting pages

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes sample usage examples or patterns
  
  The documentation does not include explicit sample usage examples or code patterns showing how to use the components. While it explains the functionality thoroughly, it lacks practical examples demonstrating typical usage patterns, which would be valuable for developers working with the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains all significant event broadcasting and inter-component communication
  
  The documentation clearly explains all significant event broadcasting and inter-component communication,
