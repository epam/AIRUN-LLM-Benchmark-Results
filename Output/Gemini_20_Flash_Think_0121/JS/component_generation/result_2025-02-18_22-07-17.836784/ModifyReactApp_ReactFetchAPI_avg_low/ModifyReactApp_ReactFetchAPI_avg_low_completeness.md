# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that a loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass**: The code includes a loading state (`loading`) and displays "Loading..." when `loading` is true.

### Step 2: Verify that the loader does not hide the search input when data is loading.
**Pass**: The search input is rendered outside the conditional block that checks for the loading state, ensuring it is always visible.

### Step 3: Validate that a request with an empty search term is sent on the initial render.
**Pass**: The `useEffect` hook calls `fetchCharacters('')` on initial render, sending a request with an empty search term.

### Step 4: Verify that the search input field is present.
**Pass**: The search input field is present in the JSX with the placeholder "Search characters".

### Step 5: Ensure that the character search functionality is implemented.
**Pass**: The `handleSearchChange` function updates the search term and calls the debounced fetch function.

### Step 6: Ensure that the API request includes the search term as a query parameter.
**Pass**: The `fetchCharacters` function includes the search term as a query parameter in the API request.

### Step 7: Validate that the data is loading on initial app load with empty query and then when the search term changes.
**Pass**: The `useEffect` hook ensures data is loaded on initial app load, and the `handleSearchChange` function ensures data is loaded when the search term changes.

### Step 8: Ensure that the debounced fetch function prevents unnecessary API requests.
**Pass**: The `debounce` function is implemented and used in `debouncedFetchCharacters` to prevent unnecessary API requests.

### Step 9: Confirm that the character list is updated based on the search results.
**Pass**: The character list is updated by setting the `characters` state with the results from the API response.

### Step 10: Validate that the application handles API request errors.
**Pass**: The `fetchCharacters` function includes a try-catch block to handle API request errors and logs them to the console.

### Step 11: Ensure that the user experience remains smooth without backend overloads.
**Pass**: The use of the debounced fetch function ensures that the user experience remains smooth by preventing backend overloads.
