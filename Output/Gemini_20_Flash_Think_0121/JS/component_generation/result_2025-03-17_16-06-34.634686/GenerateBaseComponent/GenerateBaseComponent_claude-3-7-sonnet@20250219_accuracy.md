# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x
  
  The code imports React components and hooks compatible with React 18, such as `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, and `useCallback`, and follows the functional component pattern used in React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
  
  The code includes proper TypeScript type definitions, including interfaces for `Option` and `SearchableSelectProps`, properly typed React.FC components, and properly typed refs, state variables, and function parameters.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling
  
  The solution includes a complete CSS file with styles for all component elements, and the component imports this file with `import './index.css';`.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments
  
  The code is well-structured, properly commented, and contains no TODO comments or placeholder code.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility
  
  The component uses appropriate useState hooks for managing state:
  ```typescript
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
  const [highlightedIndex, setHighlightedIndex] = useState(-1);
  const [selectedOption, setSelectedOption] = useState<Option | null>(initialValue);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props
  
  The component accepts customizable props through the `SearchableSelectProps` interface including:
  - `options`: Array of selectable options
  - `placeholder`: Customizable placeholder text (with default)
  - `onSelect`: Callback for selection events
  - `initialValue`: Optional initial selected option

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection
  
  The component includes comprehensive keyboard event handlers:
  - Enter key to open/close the dropdown
  - Arrow keys for navigation through options
  - Escape key to close the dropdown
  - Enter key to select the highlighted option

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions
  
  The component uses `useRef` appropriately for DOM elements that need direct manipulation:
  ```typescript
  const selectButtonRef = useRef<HTMLButtonElement>(null);
  const searchInputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);
  const dropdownRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques
  
  The component has proper focus management:
  - Focuses the search input when the dropdown opens
  - Returns focus to the select button when the dropdown closes
  - Maintains focus containment within the component

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
  
  The component includes appropriate ARIA attributes:
  - `aria-haspopup="listbox"` on the button
  - `aria-expanded={isOpen}` to indicate dropdown state
  - `aria-controls="options-list"` to associate the button with the dropdown
  - `role="listbox"` and `id="options-list"` on the dropdown
  - `role="option"` and `aria-selected` on individual options
  - `aria-label="Search options"` on the search input

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  The code appears free of issues that would cause console errors or warnings. Dependencies in useEffect are properly specified, and event handlers are properly created with useCallback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component
  
  The component uses optimization techniques to prevent unnecessary re-renders:
  - `useCallback` for event handlers and functions
  - Proper dependency arrays in hooks
  - Only recalculates filtered options when dependencies change
