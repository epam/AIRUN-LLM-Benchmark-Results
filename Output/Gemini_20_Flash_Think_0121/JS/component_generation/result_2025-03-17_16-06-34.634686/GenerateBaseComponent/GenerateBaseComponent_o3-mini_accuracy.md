# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (95%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  The component is built using modern React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, etc.) and follows contemporary patterns. Although there's no explicit reference to React 18 in the code, the usage of these hooks and functional components aligns with React 18.x practices. The confidence is slightly less than 100% because the code does not explicitly mention the version.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  The code is written in TypeScript with clearly defined interfaces (e.g., Option, SearchableSelectProps) and type annotations, indicating proper usage of TypeScript throughout.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  An index.css file is included, containing all necessary styling for the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  The code is clean and free of any TODO comments or extraneous debugging messages, indicating production-quality code.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  React state is managed appropriately using useState for tracking dropdown visibility, search term, highlighted index, and selected option.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  The component accepts several props (options, placeholder, onSelect, initialValue), making it reusable and customizable.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  Keyboard event handlers (handleKeyDown and handleDropdownKeyDown) are implemented for toggling, navigating, and selecting options, ensuring robust keyboard accessibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  The use of useRef for managing DOM nodes (button, input, dropdown container), along with handling clicks outside the component, demonstrates adherence to React best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  Focus management is well-handled (focusing the input when the dropdown opens and returning focus to the button when it closes), ensuring a better user experience.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  The component includes proper ARIA attributes (e.g., aria-haspopup, aria-expanded, aria-controls for the button; role="listbox" and role="option" for dropdown elements) to support screen readers and ensure accessibility.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  Based on the implementation, there are no obvious console errors or warnings. Confidence is not 100% because actual runtime behavior cannot be determined without execution, but the code appears robust.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  The implementation uses useCallback to memoize event handlers, which helps prevent unnecessary re-renders. Although this appears to be effective, slight uncertainty remains without performance profiling, hence a 90% confidence level.
