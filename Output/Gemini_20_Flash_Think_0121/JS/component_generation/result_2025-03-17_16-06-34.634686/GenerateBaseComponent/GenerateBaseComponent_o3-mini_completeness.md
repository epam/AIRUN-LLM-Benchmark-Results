# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component renders a main container with the class "searchable-select" that always contains a button, and conditionally renders the dropdown element when isOpen is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  Within the dropdown (rendered when isOpen is true), there is an <input> element with type "text" and a placeholder "Search...", confirming the presence of a search input.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The component maintains state for the selected option using useState and updates this state via the handleOptionSelect function, ensuring a single item can be selected.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The handleDropdownKeyDown function properly handles 'ArrowDown' and 'ArrowUp' events to update the highlightedIndex for navigation among options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  Both within the dropdown and on the button (when toggling open/close), the Enter key is handled to either toggle the dropdown or select the highlighted option, confirming that items can be selected via Enter.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  The select buttonâ€™s onKeyDown handler listens for the Enter key and calls toggleDropdown, allowing the dropdown to be opened and closed via keyboard input.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  The handleCloseDropdown function includes a call to selectButtonRef.current?.focus(), ensuring focus returns to the select button when the dropdown is closed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  The onClick event on each option list item calls handleOptionSelect, which in turn closes the dropdown by invoking handleCloseDropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  When navigating the dropdown using keyboard navigation, pressing Enter (after highlighting an option) triggers handleOptionSelect and subsequently closes the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  Within the handleDropdownKeyDown function, an 'Escape' key press is detected and triggers the handleCloseDropdown function to close the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  A useEffect hook sets up an event listener on mousedown events which calls handleCloseDropdown if a click is detected outside the dropdown and select button.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  When the select button is focused, pressing Enter triggers the onKeyDown handler which calls toggleDropdown, thereby opening the dropdown if it is not open.
