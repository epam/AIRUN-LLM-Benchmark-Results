# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The code fetches character data from `https://swapi.dev/api/people` using axios and displays the results in a list.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The application shows a "Loading characters..." message through the `loading-indicator` div when the `loading` state is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The code maps through all characters in the `characters` array and displays each one in a list item.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  The provided code does not include any search functionality or user input fields.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character is displayed in a list item with its name: `{character.name}`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The instructions explicitly state to "Create a new React project using Create React App with TypeScript template" and the code structure is consistent with a CRA application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The code uses React's useState hook to manage three state variables: `characters`, `loading`, and `error`, with appropriate state updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each list item has a unique key derived from the character URL: `key={character.url}`.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  The application handles loading and error states explicitly. However, it doesn't have specific handling for an empty array of characters (when `results` might be an empty array). This is likely fine as the API would return some characters, but explicit empty state handling would be more robust.
