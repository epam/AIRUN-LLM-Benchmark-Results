# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The application makes a proper API call to 'https://swapi.dev/api/people', stores the results, and maps through them for display.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The code checks the loading state and returns a div with the class "loading-indicator" when loading is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  The fetched characters are stored in state and then rendered via the map function in an unordered list.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  There is no UI element or logic that allows for search or user input; the code strictly displays the fetched data.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  The list items correctly render the characterâ€™s name from the API data.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The provided instructions indicate that the project is set up using Create React App with a TypeScript template.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The code uses the useState hook to manage 'characters', 'loading', and 'error', and the state is updated appropriately during the API call.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  Each list item uses 'character.url' as the key, ensuring uniqueness for optimal React rendering.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  The code does not explicitly display a message when the fetched characters list is empty; it will render an empty list. Although there is no error or crash, some might expect a specific "no characters found" message. This minor omission is noted, hence the 90% confidence.
