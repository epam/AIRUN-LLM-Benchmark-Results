# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name
    
    The code includes an input field with a placeholder "Search characters..." and onChange handler that triggers the search functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests
    
    The code includes loading indicators for both initial loading (`loading` state) and search-specific loading (`searchLoading` state). When loading, it renders "Loading characters..." and during search it shows "Searching characters...".

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query
    
    The code uses the `useEffect` hook with `fetchCharacters` as a dependency to load data when the component mounts. The initial `searchQuery` state is an empty string.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type
    
    The code implements a debounced search that updates results as the user types. Input changes are captured through `handleInputChange` and passed to the debounced search function.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found
    
    When no results are found, the application shows a "No characters found matching your search." message through the `displayNoResults` condition.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design
    
    The code doesn't include any CSS or responsive design elements like media queries, flex layouts, or responsive units. While the component structure might be compatible with responsive layouts, there's no explicit responsive design implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response
    
    The code conditionally renders either search results or all characters through the `charactersToDisplay` variable, which is determined by whether there's a search query.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed
    
    The code includes error handling in both the `fetchCharacters` and `handleSearch` functions, captures errors in the `error` state, and displays error messages when errors occur.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props
    
    The code defines a `Character` interface for the API data and uses TypeScript types throughout, including React's `FC` type for the component, and properly types all state variables and function parameters.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities
    
    The code maintains the ability to display the full list of characters when no search is active, and provides the additional search functionality without compromising the original listing functionality.
