# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type  
  The input field calls handleInputChange on each change event, which updates the searchQuery state and triggers the debounced search.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls  
  The code uses a debounce function with a 500ms delay before calling handleSearch, meeting the requirement.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured  
  The axios library is imported and used to perform GET requests to the API endpoints; its usage in both fetching and searching characters is correct.  

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses  
  Although interfaces and type annotations are used for state variables and component props, the API responses are not explicitly typed with a generic parameter on axios requests. This omission reduces the overall TypeScript strictness and safety.  
  (The evaluation is 90% confident because while most parts use proper type annotations, the API response typing could be improved by providing explicit types.)  

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters  
  The search API endpoint is correctly built using a template literal that includes the search query parameter.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate  
  The code properly uses useCallback for functions such as fetchCharacters, handleSearch, and debouncedSearch to prevent unnecessary re-creations.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback  
  Errors in both fetch and search operations trigger catch blocks, log errors to the console, and update the error state to display appropriate user feedback.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing  
  The debouncedSearch function ensures that the API call for searching is made only after the specified delay when the user stops typing.  

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices  
  The component uses controlled inputs and properly manages various states such as searchQuery, searchResults, and loading indicators using useState.  

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code  
  The code is clean; all imported modules are used appropriately, and there is no extraneous commented-out code.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests  
  Both the general loading state for fetching characters and the specific searchLoading state for search requests are correctly managed.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns  
  The component makes optimal use of React hooks and functional components as recommended in React 18, following current best practices.
