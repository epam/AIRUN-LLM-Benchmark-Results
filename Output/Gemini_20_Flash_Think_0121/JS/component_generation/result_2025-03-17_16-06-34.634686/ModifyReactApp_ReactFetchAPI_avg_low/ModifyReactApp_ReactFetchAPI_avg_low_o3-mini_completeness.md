# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The code includes an input field with placeholder "Search characters..." and an onChange handler that triggers search filtering.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  The component renders "Loading characters..." when the initial API request is in progress and "Searching characters..." during search requests.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  The useEffect hook calls fetchCharacters on mount, and the searchResults state is initialized with all characters from the API.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  The code uses a debounced search mechanism (via the debounce function) triggered on input change to update the search results as the user types.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  When the search yields no results, the code displays a message "No characters found matching your search."

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The component uses basic HTML elements without any CSS or responsive layout adjustments. There is no explicit implementation ensuring a responsive design for various screen sizes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  The component renders a list of characters based on the searchResults (or the full character list when no search query is provided), confirming that API responses are correctly displayed.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  Although the code handles error states by displaying an error message upon API failure, it does not include React Error Boundaries (or similar error handling components) to catch rendering errors in the component tree.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The code defines a TypeScript interface (Character) for the API data and uses appropriate types with React.FC for the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The integration of search functionality preserves the original character list display and adds search features without breaking initial data fetching or display logic.
