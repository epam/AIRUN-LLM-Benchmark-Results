# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps:

1. **Pass**: Confirm that constraints related to local storage limitations are noted.
    - The report mentions that the application relies solely on the browser's local storage for data persistence and notes the limitations related to storage capacity and lack of data backup or sync.

2. **Pass**: Verify that assumptions about the application being designed for a single user are mentioned.
    - The report clearly states that the application is designed for a single user on a single device, as data is not shared across different browsers, devices, or users.

3. **Fail**: Ensure that browser compatibility assumptions are included.
    - The report does not explicitly mention any assumptions about browser compatibility.

4. **Pass**: Check that performance-related constraints are noted.
    - The report discusses performance optimizations and constraints, including the use of `shouldComponentUpdate` and immutable data handling.

5. **Pass**: Confirm that performance optimizations, such as the use of `shouldComponentUpdate`, are identified.
    - The report identifies the use of `shouldComponentUpdate` in `TodoItem` to optimize re-rendering.

6. **Pass**: Verify that considerations for using immutable data structures for performance are mentioned.
    - The report mentions the use of immutable operations (like `map`, `filter`, `concat`, `Utils.extend`) when updating the `todos` array in `TodoModel`.

7. **Pass**: Ensure scalability considerations related to local storage limitations are discussed.
    - The report discusses the scalability limitations of a purely client-side application and the constraints of local storage.

8. **Pass**: Check that the potential need for a backend service for better scalability is mentioned.
    - The report mentions that without a backend, the application cannot scale to handle large numbers of users or complex data operations.

9. **Pass**: Confirm that the evaluation steps are unambiguous and concise.
    - The evaluation steps are clear and concise, allowing for straightforward assessment.

10. **Pass**: Ensure that each step allows the evaluator to assess the output based solely on the provided code.
    - Each step is designed to be assessed based on the provided code and the analysis in the report.

11. **Pass**: Verify that the steps are clearly articulated and cover all main points of the task.
    - The steps are clearly articulated and cover the main points of the task, including functionality, user interaction, business objectives, constraints, performance, and scalability.

### Summary

- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 11
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 10
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 1

Overall, the evaluation report is thorough and covers most of the necessary points, with the exception of explicitly mentioning browser compatibility assumptions.
