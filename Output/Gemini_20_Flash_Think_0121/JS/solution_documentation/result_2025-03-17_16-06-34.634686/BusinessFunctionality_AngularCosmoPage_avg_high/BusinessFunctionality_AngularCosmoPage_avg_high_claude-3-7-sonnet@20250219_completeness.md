- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page editing workflow
  
  The documentation clearly explains the page editing workflow, including loading existing page details, modifying attributes, saving changes, and receiving feedback through notifications.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the page duplication feature
  
  The documentation describes the page duplication feature, explaining that it creates a copy of the current page and likely redirects the user to edit the duplicated page.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains the page deletion process
  
  The documentation thoroughly explains the page deletion process, including the confirmation prompt, actual deletion via the REST API, and subsequent redirection to a new page creation screen.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the auto-URL generation from title feature

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains scheduled content publishing
  
  The documentation explains scheduled content publishing, including the date/time picker for scheduling publication and validation to prevent back-dating (though noting potential issues in the implementation).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes page revision management
  
  The documentation describes page revision management, explaining that every save operation creates a new page revision, preserving content history and potentially allowing users to revert to previous versions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the handling of page extras
