# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document identifies the application as a Todo list management application  
  The document clearly states it is for a "Todo Application" and elaborates on todo-specific features, which confirms the functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the component structure (TodoApp, TodoItem, TodoFooter)  
  The document lists and describes the roles of TodoApp, TodoItem, and TodoFooter properly along with their responsibilities.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of local storage for data persistence  
  The document correctly notes that `localStorage` is used through the Utils.store method and within the TodoModel for persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the state management approach using the TodoModel  
  The usage of TodoModel for managing and persisting state is clearly explained, including its observer pattern for notifying components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the routing mechanism for filtering todos  
  The explanation details the client-side, hash-based routing (e.g., routes like `/active` and `/completed`), which accurately reflects the implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the event handling for user interactions  
  User interactions such as adding, toggling, editing, and deleting todos are well-documented, matching the events handled in the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of immutable data structures for state management  
  The document mentions the usage of immutable data practices (e.g., using map, filter, reduce), which is consistent with best practices in the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the performance optimization using shouldComponentUpdate  
  The inclusion of `shouldComponentUpdate` in TodoItem to avoid unnecessary re-renders is clearly identified and explained.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of the Utils class for helper functions  
  The document accurately lists and describes the functions provided by the Utils class, including uuid, pluralize, store, and extend.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the data flow between components  
  The report details how data flows from TodoApp (the central component and state holder) to TodoItem and TodoFooter and the communication with TodoModel, reflecting the unidirectional data flow.
