# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Confirm that the state slices for page and user are correctly defined and managed.
- **Pass**: The `page.slice.ts` and `user.slice.ts` files define the state slices for `page` and `user` respectively. They include initial state definitions, reducers, and actions to manage the state.

### Step 2: Verify that API service functions are correctly defined and used.
- **Pass**: The `rest.service.ts` file defines the API service using `@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react`. It includes various endpoints for CRUD operations on blocks, comments, content, files, menus, modules, sitemaps, themes, settings, and users.

### Step 3: Ensure that the application correctly handles all the functionalities from the original Angular code.
- **Pass**: The provided code includes components and slices that handle functionalities such as page editing, user management, and API interactions. The `Page.tsx` component integrates these functionalities, ensuring that the application handles them correctly.

### Step 4: Verify that all functionalities like save, delete, update, and tag management are working correctly.
- **Pass**: The `Page.tsx` component and related components (`PageEditor.tsx`, `BarActions.tsx`, `TagSuggestions.tsx`) handle save, delete, update, and tag management functionalities. The API service functions are used to perform these operations.

### Step 5: Ensure that the application performs all CRUD operations correctly.
- **Pass**: The `rest.service.ts` file defines the necessary endpoints for CRUD operations. The components use these endpoints to perform create, read, update, and delete operations on various entities.

### Step 6: Verify that the application handles local storage and state persistence correctly.
- **Pass**: The `NewerVersion.tsx` component handles local storage to manage newer versions of the page. The `Page.tsx` component checks for newer versions in local storage and updates the state accordingly.
