# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props

    The provided code includes a mix of AngularJS (JavaScript) and TypeScript. The majority of the code is in AngularJS (rest.js, page.js, users.js, pageCtrl.js), with only two TypeScript files (Interfaces.ts and apiService.ts) that appear to be incomplete or partial implementations. The core functionality is still primarily implemented in AngularJS without TypeScript typing.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management

    There is no evidence of Redux Toolkit or createSlice being used for state management. The code uses AngularJS factories (Page.js, Users.js) for managing global state, which is the traditional Angular 1.x approach.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components

    The code does not contain any React components, functional or class-based. It uses AngularJS controllers and directives (pageCtrl.js, page.html) with ng-controller, ng-show, and other Angular directives.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately

    There are no React hooks present in the code. The application is built with AngularJS which does not use React hooks.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource

    The code uses AngularJS $resource for API communication, as seen in rest.js with statements like `$resource('api/blocks/:blockID'...)`. While there is a partial implementation of a fetch-based API service in apiService.ts, it's not integrated or used in the actual application code.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components

    The form handling in the application uses AngularJS two-way data binding (ng-model) rather than React controlled components. This is visible in page.html with directives like `ng-model="page.title"`.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation

    There is no evidence of React Router. The code uses AngularJS's $location service for navigation as seen in pageCtrl.js with statements like `$location.path($scope.page.url)`.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization

    The code uses AngularJS's $translate service for internationalization as seen in pageCtrl.js, not a React i18n library.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization

    There is no evidence of code splitting for performance optimization in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations

    There is no React.memo usage as the code does not use React.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks

    Since there are no React hooks used, there are no dependency arrays to evaluate.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models

    The Interfaces.ts file does define TypeScript interfaces for data models including PageState, UserState, NotifyPayload, Content, ContentTag, ContentRevision, ContentExtra, and ContentRevisionExtra. This aspect of the requirement is met.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state

    There is no evidence of Redux selectors. The code accesses state directly through AngularJS scope variables.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations

    There are no Redux action creators in the code. State mutations are performed directly through AngularJS scope variables and service methods.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks

    The code uses direct calls to localStorage (e.g., `localStorage.setItem()`, `localStorage.getItem()`) rather than using hooks for local storage functionality.
