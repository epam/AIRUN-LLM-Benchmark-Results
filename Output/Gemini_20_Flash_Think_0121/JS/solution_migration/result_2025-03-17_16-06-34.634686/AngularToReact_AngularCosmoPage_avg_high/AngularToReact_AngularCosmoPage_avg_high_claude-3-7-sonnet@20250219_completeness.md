# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented
  
  The code contains all required functionality for managing pages. The `pageCtrl.js` file includes methods for creating, updating, deleting, and duplicating pages through the `savePage()` function (with a duplicate parameter) and `deletePage()` function.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present
  
  Page type selection is implemented with the `updatePageType()` function in the controller and the select element in the HTML that uses `ng-options="(themePage | themeFiles) for themePage in page.themePages"`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists
  
  The `titleChange()` function automatically generates a URL from the page title by converting it to lowercase, replacing spaces with hyphens, and removing punctuation.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented
  
  Tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented through the `autocompleteTags()` and `selectSuggestion()` functions, with UI elements for displaying and selecting suggestions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available
  
  The HTML includes three radio buttons for publish status options: publish ('Y'), draft ('N'), and schedule ('schedule'), with corresponding UI elements.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented
  
  The code includes a datetime-local input that appears when schedule is selected, and logic in `savePage()` that processes the scheduled date appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present
  
  Local storage version comparison is implemented through the initialization code that checks for unsaved versions from previous sessions, and `localVersion()` and `deleteNewerVersion()` functions handle restoration or deletion of stored versions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented
  
  The code uses `$rootScope.$broadcast('notify', {...})` to send notification messages with appropriate translation keys and CSS classes for success and error states.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present
  
  Form validation occurs in the `savePage()` function, which checks for valid URL and page type before saving, with appropriate error messages.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled
  
  The REST factory defines all necessary API endpoints with appropriate parameters and update methods, maintaining the same structure as in the original code.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented
  
  Extras management is present in the code, with functions to save extras to both the content and content revisions, including handling of object serialization.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained
  
  Revision history functionality is maintained through saving content revisions whenever a page is saved or updated, with appropriate API calls to REST.contentRevisions.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components
  
  The provided code has a mix of Angular JS code and TypeScript, but doesn't fully demonstrate organization into feature folders. While there are TypeScript interfaces and an API service defined, the main page controller logic is still in the original Angular JS format rather than being refactored into separate business logic components. The AngularJS pattern mixes UI and business logic in controllers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved
  
  Translation functionality is preserved through the use of the `translate` directive in HTML and `$translate()` service in JavaScript for all user-facing text.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters
  
  The application maintains the same URL structure as seen in REST factory definitions and the $location.path() references in the controller code.
