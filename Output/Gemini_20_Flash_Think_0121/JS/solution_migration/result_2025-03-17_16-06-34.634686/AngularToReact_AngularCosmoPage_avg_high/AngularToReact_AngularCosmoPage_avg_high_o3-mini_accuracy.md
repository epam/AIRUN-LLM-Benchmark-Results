# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props  
  Although some TypeScript interfaces for data models are provided (in Interfaces.ts and apiService.ts), the bulk of the components (factories, controllers, templates) are implemented in AngularJS using JavaScript. Strict typing is not applied throughout the project.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management  
  There is no evidence of Redux, createSlice, or any Redux-specific state management. Global state is managed using AngularJS factories and services instead.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components  
  The code base does not include any React components. Instead, it uses AngularJS controllers and templates.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately  
  There are no React hooks present as the implementation is entirely based on AngularJS.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource  
  The REST factory in AngularJS uses $resource for API communication. Although a separate apiService.ts using fetch is partially provided, the primary API calls in the application rely on $resource.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components  
  Form handling is implemented in the AngularJS templates with directives like ng-model, not using React controlled components.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation  
  Navigation is handled via AngularJS mechanisms (e.g., ng-click and $location), not by React Router.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization  
  Internationalization is handled through Angularâ€™s $translate service instead of any React i18n library.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization  
  There is no indication of code splitting being used. The provided code does not offer evidence of dynamic imports or other code-splitting strategies.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations  
  Since React is not used in this implementation at all, React.memo is not present.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks  
  React hooks (including useEffect) are absent from the code base because the implementation is based on AngularJS.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models  
  The project includes a dedicated Typescript file (Interfaces.ts) where interfaces for data models (e.g., PageState, UserState, Content, etc.) are properly defined.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state  
  Redux is not used in this project; therefore, Redux selectors are not implemented.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations  
  There are no Redux action creators present as state changes are handled by AngularJS factories and services.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks  
  Local storage functionality is implemented imperatively via direct calls to localStorage inside AngularJS controllers, not through React hooks.
