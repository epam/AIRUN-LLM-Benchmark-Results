# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
  The code includes functions for creating pages (newPagePromise), updating pages (updatePagePromise), deleting pages (deletePage), and handling duplicate creation by checking the URL. 

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
  The page type is managed in both the UI (via an Angular select element with ng-change) and the controller (with updatePageType), ensuring that users can select a page type.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
  The controller includes a titleChange function that auto-generates a URL from the title by converting to lowercase, replacing spaces with hyphens, and stripping punctuation.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
  Tag management is handled through functions such as autocompleteTags and selectSuggestion, and the UI presents autocomplete suggestions for tags.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
  The UI defines radio buttons for publish statuses (‘Y’ for publish, ‘N’ for draft, and ‘schedule’), and the controller processes these selections accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
  The code manages scheduled publishing via a datetime-local input and contains logic to process a schedule date (including converting dates and checking if a scheduled time is in the past).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
  The code includes checks for unsaved newer versions using localStorage, with functions to restore (localVersion) or delete (deleteNewerVersion) the stored version.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
  A notification mechanism is present via $translate and $rootScope.$broadcast calls which display success or error messages based on various actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
  The savePage function validates that a page type is selected and that the URL is not empty or set to a placeholder (e.g., '/new'), enforcing required fields.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
  The code defines multiple REST endpoints using angular’s $resource (including endpoints for content, revisions, extras, tags, etc.) and uses these throughout page management, ensuring API consistency.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
  Extras are managed through functions that handle saving and updating Page.extras via REST.contentExtras and REST.contentRevisionsExtras.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
  The application creates page revisions (using REST.contentRevisions.save and related callbacks) and manages corresponding extra revisions to maintain a revision history.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
  The code is separated across various files (e.g., rest.js, pageCtrl.js, page.html, Interfaces.ts, apiService.ts) which indicates a modular structure. However, some business logic still resides in the controller, which is common in AngularJS applications. This slight mixing results in a 95% confidence level.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
  The code utilizes $translate to retrieve localized text for notifications and labels, preserving translation functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
  URL management is maintained by using $location and consistent URL parameters throughout the page management code, ensuring the expected URL structure is preserved.
