# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)
- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions
- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service
- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress
- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management
- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises
- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements

    While the form validation errors appear comprehensive and intuitive, I can't be 100% certain that these are the exact error messages specified in external requirements since no specific requirements doc was provided. The error messages in the code are well designed and cover common validation cases, but I'm marking it at 90% confidence since I can't verify against the original specifications.
