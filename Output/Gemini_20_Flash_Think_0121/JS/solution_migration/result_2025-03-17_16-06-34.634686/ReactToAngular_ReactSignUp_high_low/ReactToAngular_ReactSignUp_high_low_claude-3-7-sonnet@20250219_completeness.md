- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form includes a submit button with appropriate styling and icon
  
  The submit button is present with the appropriate styling (btn btn-primary) and includes an icon: `<button class="btn btn-primary form-control" type="submit" [disabled]="signupForm.invalid || submitted || nameAsyncValidationStatus === 'pending' || emailAsyncValidationStatus === 'pending'"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-sign-in"></i> Signup</button>`
