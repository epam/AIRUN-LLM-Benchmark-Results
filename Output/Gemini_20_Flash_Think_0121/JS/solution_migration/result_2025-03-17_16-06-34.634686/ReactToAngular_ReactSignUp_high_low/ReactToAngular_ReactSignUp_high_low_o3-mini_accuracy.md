# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The component uses FormBuilder to create a FormGroup, indicating proper use of Reactive Forms.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The signupForm is configured with Validators for required, minLength, maxLength, and email, fulfilling the synchronous validation requirements.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  The code subscribes to nameValidationChanged$ and emailValidationChanged$ streams, calling apiService methods (isName and isEmail) and updating form errors based on the responses.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The FormGroupComponent computes the bsStyle based on the field’s touched state and errors, and displays icons and error messages accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  The onSubmit() method calls apiService.signup and then uses the returned result to dispatch authActions.signupComplete, while also navigating on success.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The FormGroupComponent returns error messages based on the specific errors (required, minlength, maxlength, email, asyncInvalid, serverError), which are then rendered in the HTML template.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  The constructor of SignupComponent calls titleService.setTitle with a proper title ("Signup | PodBaby").

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The component dispatches NgRx actions and the provided auth.effects.ts shows usage of Effects for handling signup actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button’s disabled attribute is conditionally set based on the form validity, submission status, and pending asynchronous validations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  The API call in onSubmit() includes handling for both success (dispatch and navigation) and error (setting field errors appropriately).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component utilizes lifecycle hooks (ngOnInit, ngOnDestroy) appropriately and cleans up subscriptions to prevent memory leaks.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The ApiService uses Angular’s HttpClient to execute HTTP POST requests, ensuring observables are used instead of promises.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The error messages in FormGroupComponent (e.g., “This field is required”, “Must be at least … characters”, “Invalid email format”, etc.) match the expected validations outlined in the evaluation steps.
