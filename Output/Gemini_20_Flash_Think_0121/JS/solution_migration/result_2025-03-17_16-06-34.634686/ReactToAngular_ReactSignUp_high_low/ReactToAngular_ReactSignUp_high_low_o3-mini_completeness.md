# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component includes all three required form fields: name, email, and password  
  The SignupComponent creates a reactive form group that clearly specifies controls for "name", "email", and "password" with the appropriate validators.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page includes a heading 'Join PodBaby today.'  
  The HTML template starts with an <code>&lt;h2&gt;Join PodBaby today.&lt;/h2&gt;</code>, exactly matching the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a lead paragraph about membership benefits  
  The template includes a <code>&lt;p class="lead"&gt;</code> tag with the text "As a member you can subscribe to podcast feeds and keep track of your favorite episodes." which meets this condition.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form includes a submit button with appropriate styling and icon  
  The form contains a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element with Bootstrap classes (such as <code>btn</code> and <code>btn-primary</code>), and it includes an <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> element with "glyphicon glyphicon-sign-in", fulfilling the requirement for styling and icon.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a link to the login page with appropriate text  
  The template provides a link via <code>&lt;a routerLink="/login"&gt;</code> with the text "Already a member? Log in here.", satisfying this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the FormGroup component or equivalent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display  
  The custom <code>FormGroupComponent</code> is implemented with inputs for the field control and the validation status, and it properly handles styling cues (error, success) and error messages.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Icon component or equivalent is implemented for the signup button  
  Although there isn’t a dedicated "Icon component", the implementation of the icon using a Bootstrap glyphicon (<code>&lt;i class="glyphicon glyphicon-sign-in"&gt;</code>) serves as an acceptable equivalent.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all validation rules are implemented (name length, email format, password length)  
  The reactive form applies Validators on the controls:
  - Name: required, minlength of 3, maxlength of 60  
  - Email: required and email validation  
  - Password: required and minlength of 6  
  This confirms the validation rules are properly implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure asynchronous validation for both name and email uniqueness is implemented  
  Both the name and email fields are enhanced with asynchronous validation. The component listens for blur events and uses observables with switchMap to call <code>apiService.isName</code> and <code>apiService.isEmail</code> respectively. This satisfies the asynchronous uniqueness check.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API integration is complete with proper error handling  
  The component’s <code>onSubmit</code> method calls <code>apiService.signup</code> and handles responses via subscribe, including proper error handling where it sets specific server error messages on the respective form controls.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form layout matches the horizontal form structure specified  
  The HTML form uses the <code>form-horizontal</code> class and leverages the <code>app-form-group</code> component to maintain a consistent horizontal layout structure as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page has proper document title setting functionality  
  The SignupComponent’s constructor uses <code>titleService.setTitle('Signup | PodBaby');</code>, which properly sets the document title.
