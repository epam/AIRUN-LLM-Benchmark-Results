# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The code clearly uses Angular framework syntax and patterns. It includes Angular-specific decorators like `@Component`, `@Injectable`, `@NgModule`, as well as imports from Angular core packages such as `@angular/core`, `@angular/common`, etc. The initial comment also specifies this is an "Angular 14.x Migration of React Todo Application."

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
  
  The application properly implements NgRx store. This is evident from imports like `import { Store } from '@ngrx/store';` and the creation of a state module with reducers, actions, and selectors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
  
  The code includes a properly implemented effects class (`TodoEffects`) that handles side effects like loading todos, adding todos, etc. The effects are registered in the state module with `EffectsModule.forRoot([TodoEffects])`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
  
  The code includes well-structured actions, reducers, and selectors:
  - Actions are defined with `createAction` and include appropriate props
  - A reducer is implemented using `createReducer` with `on` handlers for each action
  - Selectors are created with `createSelector` and include derived state calculations

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
  
  The components properly use Angular decorators:
  - `@Component` for component declarations
  - `@Input()` for property binding
  - `@Output()` for event emissions
  - `@ViewChild` for DOM element references

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators
  
  React refs have been properly replaced with Angular's `@ViewChild` decorator. For example:
  ```typescript
  @ViewChild('newField') newField!: ElementRef;
  @ViewChild('editField') editField!: ElementRef;
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
  
  The components properly use `@Input()` for property binding and `@Output() EventEmitter` for event handling. For example:
  ```typescript
  @Input() todo!: ITodo;
  @Output() onToggle = new EventEmitter<void>();
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
  
  The application uses proper Angular services for data handling. The `TodoModel` and `Utils` classes are decorated with `@Injectable()` to make them available for dependency injection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
  
  Dependency injection is properly implemented throughout the application. Services and store are injected via constructor parameters:
  ```typescript
  constructor(
    private todoModel: TodoModel,
    private router: Router,
    private route: ActivatedRoute,
    private store: Store<{ todosState: TodoState }>
  ) { }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
  
  The `TodoItemComponent` and `TodoFooterComponent` use the `OnPush` change detection strategy to optimize performance:
  ```typescript
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
  
  The application uses Angular Router for navigation. It includes an `AppRoutingModule` with defined routes, and the main app component includes a `<router-outlet>` in its template.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code follows Angular style guide conventions:
  - Components use the `-component` suffix
  - Services use the `.service` suffix (or model/utils distinction)
  - Files are appropriately named (e.g., `todo.model.ts`, `todo.actions.ts`)
  - Modules are organized according to feature

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that
