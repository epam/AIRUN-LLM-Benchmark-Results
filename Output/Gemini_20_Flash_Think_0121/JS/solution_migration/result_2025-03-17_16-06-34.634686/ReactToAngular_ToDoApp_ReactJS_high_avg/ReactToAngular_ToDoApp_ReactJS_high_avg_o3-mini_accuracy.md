# Evaluation Report

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The code explicitly states that it is a migration for Angular 14.x and uses Angular CLI commands (e.g., “ng new angular-todo …”), which confirms the framework version.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The code imports and configures @ngrx/store (using StoreModule.forRoot with a reducer) for state management.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  The code contains EffectsModule.forRoot with defined effects in TodoEffects that handle side effects.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  The implementation defines actions, reducers (using createReducer and on handlers), and selectors for retrieving slices of state.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  All components use the @Component decorator and correctly apply @Input and @Output for property binding and event emission.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  The React refs have been replaced with Angular’s @ViewChild (e.g., in TodoAppComponent for ‘newField’ and in TodoItemComponent for ‘editField’).

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  Components are communicating via @Input() bindings and @Output() event emitters, thus following Angular practices.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  Services such as TodoModel and Utils are implemented with the @Injectable decorator and handle data logic appropriately.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  Dependency injection is used consistently throughout the code (e.g., injecting Store, TodoModel, and services in component constructors).

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  Components like TodoItemComponent and TodoFooterComponent use ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush to optimize change detection.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  The application includes an app-routing.module.ts with RouterModule configuration to manage navigation and routing.

- **Pass (95%)**: Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code is modularized and naming conventions (e.g., component file names, use of TypeScript interfaces) follow Angular best practices. There might be minor deviations for those with stricter interpretations of the style guide.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  TypeScript interfaces (e.g., ITodo, IAppState, ITodoItemProps) are defined and used for typing across the application.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  The templates have been moved to separate HTML files (indicated by templateUrl properties) instead of embedded JSX.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  Event handling is managed through Angular event bindings and dispatching actions via NgRx rather than using React event handlers.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  The code does not show any “TODO” comments; only descriptive comments are present.

- **Fail (100%)**: Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  Although there is a comment indicating the generation of a module with lazy-loading capabilities (“ng g module state --route state ...”), the code imports the StateModule directly in the AppModule instead of configuring it for lazy loading. This indicates that lazy-loading is not actually implemented.
