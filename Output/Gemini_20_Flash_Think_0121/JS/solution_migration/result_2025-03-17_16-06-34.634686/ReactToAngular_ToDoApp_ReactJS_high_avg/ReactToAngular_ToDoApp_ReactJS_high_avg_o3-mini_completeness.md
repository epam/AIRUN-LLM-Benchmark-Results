# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The code uses an observable (todos$) from the store (via the selector selectVisibleTodos) in the TodoAppComponent, ensuring that all todos (filtered or not) are displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoAppComponent includes a handleNewTodoKeyDown method that dispatches an addTodo action when the ENTER key is pressed, and the TodoModel has an addTodo method updating the todos list.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  Both the TodoAppComponent and TodoItemComponent implement toggle functionality by dispatching toggle actions, which are handled by corresponding methods in TodoModel and the NgRx reducer.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent includes methods (handleEdit, handleSubmit, and key handlers) that dispatch save and setEditing actions to allow editing of a todo item, and the updated logic is supported by the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  The code shows a destroyTodo method in both the TodoModel and TodoItemComponent. Actions for deleting todos are dispatched and handled by the reducer, verifying deletion functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  In TodoAppComponent, the toggleAll method dispatches an action that is handled by TodoModel’s toggleAll method and the corresponding NgRx effect/reducer, implementing the 'mark all as complete' feature.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  The routing configuration (with paths for '', 'active', and 'completed') combined with dispatching setNowShowing actions and selectors filtering based on the constants (ALL_TODOS, ACTIVE_TODOS, COMPLETED_TODOS) ensures filtering works correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooterComponent uses an activeTodoCount$ observable (from selectActiveTodoCount) to display the active items count, and a utility (pluralize) is used to format the display.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The TodoFooterComponent implements a handleClearCompleted method that dispatches a clearCompleted action. In addition, the TodoModel and corresponding NgRx actions/reducers remove completed todos from the list.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  The TodoModel makes use of the Utils service which employs localStorage (via its store method) to persist the todos. Updates to the todos are saved via updateStore, confirming persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The app-routing.module defines specific routes for the base path, active, and completed views, and the TodoAppComponent updates the view accordingly. The URL structure stays consistent with the expected patterns.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  Although the code does not show detailed template logic for empty states, the structure (using observables and conditional rendering in Angular’s templating system) suggests that an appropriate UI would be displayed.  
  Explanation: The actual HTML template isn’t provided, so while the architecture supports handling empty states, the exact UI details cannot be confirmed with complete certainty.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  The TodoAppComponent prevents default form submission behavior in handleNewTodoKeyDown and dispatches actions as expected. Similarly, TodoItemComponent handles submission on ENTER key press, confirming proper form handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The application is well segmented into components (TodoAppComponent, TodoItemComponent, and TodoFooterComponent) with communication managed via the NgRx store, ensuring clear component separation and relationships.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  While the majority of the business logic has been migrated (e.g., adding, toggling, editing, deleting todos), the TodoEffects reference methods on TodoModel (such as getTodosFromStore, addTodoToStore, etc.) that are not implemented in the TodoModel. This discrepancy indicates that some parts of the intended business logic may be missing or improperly connected.
