# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The code imports from the Angular core libraries (`@angular/core`, `@angular/platform-browser`, etc.) and uses Angular's component architecture, module system, and decorators consistent with Angular 14.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS
  
  The code consistently uses ES module imports throughout (import statements at the top of each file) rather than RequireJS's `require()` syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management
  
  The code correctly imports and implements `@ngrx/store` with `StoreModule.forRoot(reducers, { metaReducers })` in the app module, and uses store selects and dispatches throughout the components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects
  
  The application properly implements `@ngrx/effects` with `EffectsModule.forRoot([TodoEffects])` in the app module and has a properly defined effects class (`TodoEffects`).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management
  
  The code includes properly defined actions (`todo.actions.ts` and `filter.actions.ts`), reducers (`todo.reducer.ts` and `filter.reducer.ts`), selectors (`todo.selectors.ts` and `filter.selector.ts`), and effects (`todo.effects.ts`).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator
  
  The `TodoService` is properly decorated with `@Injectable()` and registered in the providers array of the app module.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service
  
  The `TodoService` uses `localStorage` for todo persistence with `localStorage.getItem()` and `localStorage.setItem()`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators
  
  All components (`AppComponent`, `TodoHeaderComponent`, `TodoListComponent`, `TodoItemComponent`, `TodoFooterComponent`) are properly decorated with `@Component()` decorators.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators
  
  Both the `TodoFocusDirective` and `TodoEscapeDirective` are properly decorated with `@Directive()` decorators.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)
  
  The components use Angular's structural directives correctly, such as `*ngIf="(todos$ | async)?.length > 0"` and `*ngFor="let todo of todos$ | async; trackBy: trackByFn"`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))
  
  Event binding is correctly implemented throughout the components, such as `(click)="setFilter('all')"` and `(ngSubmit)="addTodo()"`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])
  
  Property binding is properly implemented, including examples like `[ngClass]="{'completed': todo.completed, 'editing': editing}"` and `[class.selected]="(currentFilter$ | async) === 'all'"`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed
  
  Lifecycle hooks are correctly implemented when needed, including `ngOnDestroy()` in `TodoItemComponent` and `ngAfterViewInit()` in `TodoFocusDirective`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models
  
  The code defines and uses appropriate TypeScript interfaces for models, including `Todo`, `AppState`, `TodoState`, and `FilterType`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services
  
  Dependency injection is correctly implemented throughout the application, with services and store being injected through constructor parameters.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows
