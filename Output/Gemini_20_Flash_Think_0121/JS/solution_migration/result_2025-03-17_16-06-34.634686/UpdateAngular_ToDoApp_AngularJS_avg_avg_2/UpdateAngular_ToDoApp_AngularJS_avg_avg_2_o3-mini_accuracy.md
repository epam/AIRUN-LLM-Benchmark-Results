# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The code and instructions clearly mention that the migration is for Angular 14.x. The Angular CLI usage and Angular module/component patterns are consistent with Angular 14.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
  The provided code uses the modern ES module system with import/export syntax, indicating that RequireJS is not used.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
  The code imports and utilizes @ngrx/store in modules (e.g., AppModule) and various selectors, demonstrating proper state management with the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
  NgRx Effects are implemented as seen in TodoEffects, handling side effects like saving todos and loading data.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
  The codebase includes clearly defined actions, reducers (e.g., todo.reducer, filter.reducer), selectors, and effects that together manage todos as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
  The TodoService uses the @Injectable decorator, making it properly injectable in Angular.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
  The TodoService methods (getTodos and saveTodos) interact with localStorage to persist data.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
  All components (e.g., AppComponent, TodoHeaderComponent, TodoListComponent, etc.) are correctly declared using the @Component decorator.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
  Both TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective are implemented with the @Directive decorator and proper host bindings/listeners.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
  Templates include Angular directives like *ngFor and *ngIf, indicating correct usage of Angular template syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
  Event binding (e.g., (click) and (ngSubmit)) is used throughout the code for handling interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
  The code uses property bindings such as [ngClass] and [ngModel] correctly following Angular conventions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
  Lifecycle hooks like ngAfterViewInit in TodoFocusDirective and ngOnDestroy in TodoItemComponent are appropriately implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
  The Todo model and AppState interfaces are defined using TypeScript, ensuring proper data typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
  Dependencies are injected via constructors in components and services, following Angularâ€™s dependency injection patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The structure and naming conventions are consistent with best practices from the Angular style guides.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
  Although the code appears correct and clean, this evaluation is based solely on the static code review. Without actually running the application, there is a slight uncertainty regarding runtime console errors or warnings.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
  The code leverages TypeScript effectively with interfaces, types, and decorators, ensuring type safety and clarity.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
  The code is clean and free from leftover TODO comments or extraneous commented-out blocks.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design  
  The migration splits the responsibilities into distinct components (header, list, item, footer), directives, services, etc., adhering to the single responsibility principle.
