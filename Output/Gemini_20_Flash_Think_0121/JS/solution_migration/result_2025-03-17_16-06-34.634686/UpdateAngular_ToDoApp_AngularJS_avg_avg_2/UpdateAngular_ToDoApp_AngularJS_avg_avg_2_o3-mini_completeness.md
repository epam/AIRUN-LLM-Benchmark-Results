# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list  
  The application includes a TodoListComponent that renders the list of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos  
  The TodoHeaderComponent is present, providing an input field and functionality to add todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos  
  The TodoItemComponent contains editable functionality (e.g., switching to edit mode, updating the title) for each todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos  
  Filtering is implemented via the TodoFooterComponent along with a FilterPipe and associated state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics  
  The TodoFooterComponent displays the count of remaining (active) todos.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos  
  The TodoHeaderComponent dispatches an action when a new todo is added.  
  (Slight caution due to differences in naming conventions between the component’s dispatch (new AddTodoAction) and the NgRx action definitions, but the intended functionality is present.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos  
  The TodoItemComponent allows editing by entering an edit mode and dispatching an update action on change.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos  
  There is a delete button in the TodoItemComponent that dispatches a DeleteTodoAction.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed  
  The TodoItemComponent provides a checkbox that toggles the completion state for each todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)  
  The TodoFooterComponent allows the user to select different filters through clickable links that dispatch filtering actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete  
  The TodoListComponent includes a “toggle-all” checkbox linked to a ToggleAllTodoAction, correctly handling bulk completion toggling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos  
  A clear-completed button in the TodoFooterComponent dispatches an action to remove completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos  
  The activeCount$ observable is used in the TodoFooterComponent to display the count of active todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage  
  The TodoService implements methods to save and retrieve todos from localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization  
  The TodoEffects include an effect that calls TodoService.getTodos() during initialization (via loadTodos).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing  
  The todoEscape directive in TodoItemComponent listens for the escape key to cancel editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo  
  The todoFocus directive uses ngAfterViewInit to focus the input element when required.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original  
  The provided index.html and use of todomvc CSS files suggest that visual consistency is maintained.  
  (There is slight uncertainty as custom styling details are not fully detailed, but the overall structure adheres to TodoMVC standards.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately  
  The code checks for empty or whitespace-only titles and either refrains from adding a new todo or deletes the todo when editing results in an empty title.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter  
  Although the filter state is updated via NgRx, there is no implementation to reflect the filter selection in the URL (for example, using Angular Router to update the URL based on the filter). This functionality is missing.
