# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed
  
  The code properly implements the functionality to create new todos when the Enter key is pressed in the `handleNewTodoKeyDown` function in `TodoApp.tsx`. The function checks for the ENTER_KEY (defined as 13 in constants.ts), retrieves the input value, and dispatches the `addTodo` action if the value is not empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter
  
  The application uses the `selectVisibleTodos` selector to filter todos based on the current filter type (ALL_TODOS, ACTIVE_TODOS, COMPLETED_TODOS). The filtered todos are displayed in a list within the `TodoApp` component, and each todo is rendered as a `TodoItem`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos
  
  The `handleToggleAll` function in `TodoApp.tsx` dispatches the `toggleCompleteAll` action when the toggle-all checkbox is clicked, which sets all todos to completed or active based on the checkbox state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted
  
  The `TodoItem` component includes functionality for toggling completion (`onToggle`), editing (`onEdit`), and deleting (`onDestroy`) individual todos, which are passed from the parent `TodoApp` component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode
  
  In the `TodoItem` component, the `label` element has an `onDoubleClick` handler (`handleEdit`) that calls the `onEdit` prop, which sets the todo in editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo
  
  The `handleKeyDown` function in `TodoItem` checks for the ENTER_KEY (13) and calls `handleSubmit` when it is pressed, which saves the edited todo text.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value
  
  The `handleKeyDown` function in `TodoItem` also checks for the ESCAPE_KEY (27) and resets the edit text to the original todo title before calling `onCancel` to exit edit mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The `TodoFooter` component receives the `count` prop (active todos count) and displays it with the pluralized "item" text.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The `TodoFooter` component includes three filter links (All, Active, Completed) that call `onFilterChange` with the appropriate filter value when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos
  
  The `TodoFooter` component includes a "Clear completed" button that calls `onClearCompleted` when clicked, which is only shown when there are completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence
  
  The application uses `Utils.store` and `Utils.updateStore` functions to load and save todos to localStorage. In addition, the actions in the Redux todosSlice also update localStorage using `Utils.updateStore`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state
  
  The `TodoApp` component conditionally renders the main section and footer based on the presence of todos. The footer is shown only when there are active or completed todos, and the "Clear completed" button is shown only when there are completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count
  
  The `Utils.pluralize` function is used in the `TodoFooter` component to correctly pluralize "item" based on the count of active todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components
  
  The application is well structured with separate components for `App`, `TodoApp`, `TodoItem`, and `TodoFooter`, each with focused responsibilities. The components are properly composed with props for communication.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify
