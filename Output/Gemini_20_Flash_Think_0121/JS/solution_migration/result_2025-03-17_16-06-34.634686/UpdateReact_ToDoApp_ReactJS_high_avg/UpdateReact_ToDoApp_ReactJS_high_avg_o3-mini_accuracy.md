# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all React imports use React 18.x compatible syntax  
  All files use imports like "import React from 'react'" and utilize ReactDOM.createRoot, which is appropriate for React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all components use functional component syntax with hooks instead of class components  
  Every component (App, TodoApp, TodoItem, TodoFooter, etc.) is defined as a functional component using hooks like useState, useEffect, and useCallback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Redux Toolkit's createSlice is used for state management  
  Both todosSlice and filtersSlice use createSlice from Redux Toolkit for state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for all props, state, and Redux store  
  Interfaces such as ITodo, ITodoModel, and the prop interfaces for components are defined, and type definitions for the store (RootState, AppDispatch) are in place.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses immutable state updates in reducers  
  The reducers use immutable patterns (the spread operator, Array.map, Array.filter) to update state rather than mutating it directly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that nanoid is used for ID generation instead of custom UUID implementation  
  The Utils.uuid() function wraps the nanoid() call ensuring that ID generation is handled by nanoid.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application uses React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate  
  Components such as TodoItem and TodoFooter are wrapped with React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that useCallback is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders  
  The code makes appropriate use of useCallback for most event handlers in multiple components.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage handling is implemented in a modern way  
  The Utils.store and Utils.updateStore functions encapsulate localStorage interactions with JSON parsing/stringification, which is acceptable for the application’s complexity.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows consistent naming conventions throughout the application  
  The naming conventions are consistent (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components), and the file organization is uniform.

- **Fail** (85%): Verify that proper error handling is implemented where necessary  
  While the code is clean, there is little explicit error handling (for example, during localStorage JSON parsing or in asynchronous operations). In small-scale applications this may be acceptable; however, more robust error management (try-catch blocks, error boundaries in React) would be beneficial. The confidence is slightly less than 100% because the need for error handling can be subjective based on application criticality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware  
  The Redux store is created using configureStore from Redux Toolkit, which automatically includes important middleware such as redux-thunk and is configured correctly.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that React.lazy is used for code splitting where appropriate  
  The application does not make use of React.lazy for dynamic component loading. In larger applications or where performance is critical, code splitting can be beneficial. Its absence here marks this step as failed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the codebase has no TODOs remaining  
  There are no outstanding "TODO" comments in the code, indicating that all planned features/changes have been addressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux Provider wraps the application entry point  
  In src/index.tsx, the <Provider store={store}> correctly wraps the <App /> component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure strict TypeScript type checking is implemented throughout the application  
  The usage of explicit TypeScript interfaces and types across the code—such as component props, Redux state, and hooks—demonstrates adherence to strict typing practices.
