# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The code in TodoApp.tsx checks for the ENTER_KEY during the onKeyDown event and dispatches the addTodo action if a trimmed value is present.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The selectVisibleTodos selector filters todos based on the current filter (All, Active, Completed), and the TodoApp component maps over the filtered list.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  The handleToggleAll function in TodoApp.tsx dispatches toggleCompleteAll, which updates all todo itemsâ€™ completion status.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  Each TodoItem receives onToggle, onEdit, and onDestroy callbacks. These are used in the item component to dispatch corresponding actions that update or remove individual todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  In TodoItem.tsx, the label element has an onDoubleClick handler (handleEdit) that triggers editing mode by invoking the onEdit callback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  The onKeyDown handler in TodoItem checks for the ENTER_KEY and calls handleSubmit, which in turn calls onSave to submit the change.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  The onKeyDown handler in TodoItem also checks for the ESCAPE_KEY and, upon detecting it, resets the editText state to the original todo title before invoking onCancel.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooter component receives the count of active items and displays it prominently using a <strong> tag.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The TodoFooter contains three filter links rendered as <a> elements that update the filter state when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  The code conditionally renders the "Clear completed" button in TodoFooter if there are any completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  Both the TodoModel and the todosSlice utilize Utils.store and Utils.updateStore to read from and write to localStorage, ensuring persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  The TodoApp component conditionally renders the main section (the list of todos) and the footer based on the state of active and completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  The TodoFooter component calls Utils.pluralize to correctly form the word "item" or "items" based on the active todo count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The code is well-organized into separate components: TodoApp, TodoItem, and TodoFooter, each with a dedicated responsibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  Files are structured by functionality, with directories like components, models, features (for slices and selectors), and utils, ensuring clear separation of concerns.
