# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration
  
  The code clearly shows React 18 usage with the modern `ReactDOM.createRoot` API in `index.tsx`. TypeScript configuration is evident from the `.tsx` file extensions and TypeScript interfaces and types used throughout the codebase.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure
  
  TypeScript interfaces are properly used throughout the code, including for the `soundMapper` object and component props such as `MainProps`, `ButtonContainerProps`, `PianoProps`, and `PianoKeyProps`.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks
  
  While most components are correctly implemented as functional components with React hooks, there's an issue in the `Main.tsx` file where `playPianoKey` and `resetPianoKey` are referenced in the dependency arrays of useCallback hooks before they are defined. This would cause a reference error. These functions should be defined with useCallback or moved above the hooks that reference them.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)
  
  The application correctly uses `useState` for maintaining component state (showLetters, activeNotes) and `useEffect` for side effects like adding/removing event listeners and updating UI based on state changes.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels
  
  The `Main.tsx` file contains calls to undefined functions `playPianoKey` and `resetPianoKey` within the `handleKeyDown` and `handleKeyUp` callbacks. These function references would cause runtime errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events
  
  Mouse interactions are properly implemented using React synthetic events with proper typing via TypeScript (React.MouseEvent<HTMLDivElement>).

- **Fail** (95%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment
  
  The code initializes Audio objects with relative paths (`'./assets/audio/a.mp3'`), which may not work correctly in a React application bundled with webpack. In React, these should typically be imported or accessed via the public folder with absolute paths. Additionally, there's a duplicate entry for 'a' in the soundMapper.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility
  
  The fullscreen functionality is properly implemented using the standard Fullscreen API within a React useCallback hook.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns
  
  Conditional class application is implemented correctly using template literals and ternary operators, following React best practices.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate
  
  While the code uses `useCallback` effectively to memoize functions, there is no evidence of using `React.memo` for component memoization, which would be appropriate for components like `PianoKey` that could benefit from preventing unnecessary re-renders.

- **Fail** (95%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations
  
  The audio instances in `soundMapper` are created outside of React's lifecycle. This approach can work but isn't optimal for React. Ideally, they should be instantiated in a useEffect hook or using useRef to avoid recreating them on re-renders.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application
  
  There are inconsistencies in the component import paths. For example, in `Main.tsx`, components are imported from `./components/Piano` when they should be from `./Piano` since the file itself is in the components directory. This suggests improper path resolution that would cause compilation errors.
