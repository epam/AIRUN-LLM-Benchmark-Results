# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'
  
  The `Header.tsx` component correctly renders a header with the title "Virtual Piano" using the appropriate className "header-title".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons
  
  The `ButtonContainer.tsx` component correctly implements two buttons with the appropriate labels "Notes" and "Letters" that toggle between showing notes and letters on the piano keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)
  
  The `Piano.tsx` component properly renders all natural keys (c, d, e, f, g, a, b) and all sharp keys (c♯, d♯, f♯, g♯, a♯) with appropriate structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes
  
  The `PianoKey.tsx` component correctly assigns data attributes for both notes and letters:
  ```typescript
  data-note={note}
  data-letter={letter}
  ```

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked
  
  The application has a soundMapper object with audio files for each note, and the `playNote` function is called when keys are pressed. However, there appears to be a minor issue where the 'c' key uses the 'a.mp3' audio file instead of 'c.mp3' in the soundMapper.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)
  
  The application correctly adds the 'piano-key-active' class to keys when they are pressed, both through the `playPianoKey` function and by passing the `isActive` prop to the `PianoKey` component.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes
  
  There's a circular dependency in the code. The `handleKeyDown` function depends on `playPianoKey` function, but `playPianoKey` is defined after `handleKeyDown` is used in a useCallback hook. The same issue occurs with `handleKeyUp` depending on `resetPianoKey`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked
  
  The application correctly implements toggle functionality through the `toggleLetters` function and manages the active button state properly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes
  
  The `handleFullscreen` function correctly implements toggling between fullscreen and normal modes using the Fullscreen API.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly
  
  The application uses an array `activeNotes` to track multiple simultaneous key presses and properly updates this state with the `setActiveNotes` function.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys
  
  The `handlePianoMouseMove` function properly checks if the left mouse button is pressed (`event.buttons === 1`) and plays the note of the key the mouse is dragged over.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information
  
  The `Footer.tsx` component correctly renders a footer with the year "2020".

- **Fail** (100%): Verify correct file structure and imports
  
  There are several import path issues in the code:
  1. In `Main.tsx`, the imports for Piano and ButtonContainer use incorrect paths:
     ```typescript
     import Piano from './components/Piano';
     import ButtonContainer from './components/ButtonContainer';
     ```
     should be:
     ```typescript
     import Piano from './Piano';
     import ButtonContainer from './ButtonContainer';
     ```
  
  2. Similarly in `Piano.tsx`, the import for PianoKey uses an incorrect path:
     ```typescript
     import PianoKey from './components/PianoKey';
     ```
     should be:
     ```typescript
     import PianoKey from './PianoKey';
     ```
