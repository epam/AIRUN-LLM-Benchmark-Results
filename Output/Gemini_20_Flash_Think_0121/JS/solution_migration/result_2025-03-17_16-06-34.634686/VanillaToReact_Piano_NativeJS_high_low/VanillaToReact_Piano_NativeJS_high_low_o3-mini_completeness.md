# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'  
  The Header component renders an h1 element with the text "Virtual Piano", confirming this functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons  
  The ButtonContainer component renders two buttons with the corresponding texts "Notes" and "Letters" and uses React refs accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)  
  The Piano component renders seven natural keys and a set of sharp keys (including a placeholder div), which meets the intended design for both types of keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes  
  The PianoKey component assigns both data-note and data-letter attributes properly, ensuring that each key carries the necessary data.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked  
  The Main component utilizes a soundMapper that associates each note with an audio file. Clicking a key calls playNote, which plays the corresponding audio.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)  
  The application applies the CSS class 'piano-key-active' to keys when active. This is done both via dynamic rendering (based on the isActive prop) and through event handlers that add or remove the class.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes  
  The Main component registers global keydown and keyup event listeners that target keys by their data-letter attributes, triggering both visual feedback and audio playback.  
  Explanation: Although the approach works as intended, the use of a locally defined function (playPianoKey) inside the event callbacks could raise minor concerns regarding its declaration order relative to the hooks’ dependency array. This does not affect functionality but causes slight uncertainty in code structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked  
  The state toggle in Main combined with the ButtonContainer’s event handlers correctly switches the display as indicated by the CSS classes applied.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes  
  The fullscreen button properly triggers a function that employs the Fullscreen API to switch modes.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly  
  The logic in playNote allows for different keys (notes) to be active simultaneously by managing state as an array.  
  Explanation: While the mechanism supports multiple unique key presses, the code checks to avoid duplicate entries. This meets the requirement, but without live testing, there is a minor reservation regarding complex simultaneous actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys  
  The Piano component provides event handlers (onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseMove, and onMouseOut) to support mouse drag interactions across the keys, ensuring continuous input.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information  
  The Footer component successfully renders a footer containing the year "2020".
