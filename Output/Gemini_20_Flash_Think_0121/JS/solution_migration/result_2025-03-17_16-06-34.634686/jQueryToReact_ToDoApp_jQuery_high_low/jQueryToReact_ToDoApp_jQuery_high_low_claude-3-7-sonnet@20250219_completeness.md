- **Fail** (100%): Missing import in Footer component

    The Footer component has a `useEffect` hook but does not import it from React. This will cause a runtime error. The import statement for `useEffect` is missing from the component:
    
    ```typescript
    import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
    ```
    
    Currently, it only imports React without the useEffect hook, but useEffect is used twice in the component.
