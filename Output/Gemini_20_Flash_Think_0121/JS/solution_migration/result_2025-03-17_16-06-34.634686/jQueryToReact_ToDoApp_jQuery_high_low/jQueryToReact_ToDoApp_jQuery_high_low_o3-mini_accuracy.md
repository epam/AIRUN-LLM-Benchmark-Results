# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18.x  
  The code uses ReactDOM.createRoot, which is a React 18 feature, confirming the application is built with React 18.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript for type safety  
  The code files have .tsx and .ts extensions, and type annotations (such as React.FC, interface definitions, etc.) are in place.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for state management  
  The todosSlice is created using createSlice from Redux Toolkit, which confirms this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm nanoid is used for generating unique IDs  
  The todosSlice uses nanoid in the prepare callback for addTodo, satisfying this condition.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code uses functional components with hooks instead of class components  
  All components are implemented as functional components making extensive use of hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, etc.).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains the same routing functionality with proper route handling  
  The application uses react-router-dom components (Routes, Route, NavLink, useParams) to implement routing and filtering, maintaining proper route handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Redux store is properly configured with appropriate slices  
  The store is configured with a reducer that correctly integrates the todos slice from todosSlice.ts.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the Redux provider is set up in the application entry point  
  The index.tsx file wraps the application with <Provider store={store}>, ensuring Redux is properly provided to the React component tree.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for all data structures  
  Interfaces for Todo, TodosState, as well as types for RootState and AppDispatch are defined, ensuring type safety for data structures.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the code follows React best practices for component composition  
  The code is well structured with clear separation of concerns and usage of hooks. However, one minor concern is that the Footer component uses useEffect without explicitly importing it from React, which may indicate a lapse in following best practices. This is a minor issue that does not impact overall component composition.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles keyboard events properly  
  The Header and TodoItem components handle keyboard events appropriately (using Enter to create/update todos and Escape to cancel edits), fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application maintains local storage persistence if implemented  
  The todosSlice implements getTodosFromLocalStorage and saveTodosToLocalStorage with proper try/catch error handling. The local storage persistence mechanism is in place and in use.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  In the Footer component, there is the use of useEffect without an import statement for useEffect from React. This omission can lead to runtime errors or warnings in the console. Although this might be an oversight that can be fixed with an import, it does represent a failure for this step.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application implements proper error handling  
  The code includes error handling in the local storage operations within the todosSlice (i.e., using try/catch blocks and logging errors), meeting this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code is optimized with no unnecessary re-renders  
  The use of React hooks such as useCallback and the careful management of component state helps minimize unnecessary re-renders. The code appears optimized in this regard.
