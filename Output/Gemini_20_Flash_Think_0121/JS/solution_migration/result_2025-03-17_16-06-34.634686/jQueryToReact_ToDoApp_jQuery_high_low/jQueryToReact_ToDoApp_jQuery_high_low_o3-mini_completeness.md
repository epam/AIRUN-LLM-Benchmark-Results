# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos  
  The Header component renders an <code>&lt;h1&gt;todos&lt;/h1&gt;</code> element and an input field with the placeholder "What needs to be done?", fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos  
  The Main component renders a <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> container that includes a toggle-all checkbox as well as the TodoList component for displaying todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button  
  The TodoItem component includes an input of type checkbox for toggling, a label to display the title, and a button with the class "destroy" to delete the todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode  
  In the TodoItem component, the label has an onDoubleClick handler that triggers editing by setting the editing state, enabling an input field to appear.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The Footer component renders filter links via NavLink for "All", "Active", and "Completed". Additionally, the todosSlice and the setFilter action support filtering.  
  Note: The Footer component uses <code>useEffect</code> without an explicit import, which might be a minor oversight; however, the filtering functionality is conceptually implemented correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization  
  The Footer component correctly displays a count with the text "item" or "items" based on the count, using a conditional expression.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter  
  The use of NavLink components with conditional classes ensures that the current filter is highlighted appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist  
  The Footer component conditionally renders a "Clear completed" button when <code>completedTodosCount &gt; 0</code>.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter  
  In the Header component, pressing Enter while the input contains text dispatches the addTodo action, creating a new todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos  
  Each TodoItem includes a checkbox that dispatches the toggleTodo action, toggling the completed status.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once  
  The Main component provides a toggle-all checkbox that dispatches the toggleAllTodos action for bulk updating todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management  
  Double-clicking a todo activates editing mode, and the input field is automatically focused using a ref and setTimeout to allow the component to render.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos  
  The TodoItem component has a destroy button that, when clicked, dispatches the deleteTodo action to remove the todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos  
  The Footer component provides a "Clear completed" button that dispatches the deleteCompletedTodos action to clear all todos that are marked as completed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status  
  The todosSlice includes selectors and a reducer for filtering todos (all, active, completed), and these are correctly utilized in the components to display the appropriate list.
