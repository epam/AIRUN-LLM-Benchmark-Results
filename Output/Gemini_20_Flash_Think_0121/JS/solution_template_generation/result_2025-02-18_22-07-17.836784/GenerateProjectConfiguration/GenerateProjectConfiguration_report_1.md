Your task is to create a project configuration based on the Vite builder with support for React, Redux, React-Router, TypeScript, and testing library.

When generating the code, ensure to adhere to the instructions below:
- Describe the provided commands.
- Provide a package.json file.
- The generated code should not contain any TODOs.
- Simply return the codebase without additional comments within the code.

## Run 1:
### Answer:
```
npm create vite@latest my-react-app --template react-ts
cd my-react-app
npm install
npm install react-router-dom @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux @testing-library/react @testing-library/user-event @testing-library/jest-dom jest jest-environment-jsdom -D
```

### Description of commands:

*   `npm create vite@latest my-react-app --template react-ts`: This command uses npm to execute the `create vite@latest` command, which scaffolds a new Vite project. `my-react-app` is the project name, and `--template react-ts` specifies the React TypeScript template to use, pre-configuring the project for React and TypeScript.
*   `cd my-react-app`: This command changes the current directory to `my-react-app`, which is the project directory created in the previous step.
*   `npm install`: This command installs the default dependencies listed in the `package.json` file that was generated by the Vite scaffolding process. These typically include React and React DOM, along with Vite and its plugins.
*   `npm install react-router-dom @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux @testing-library/react @testing-library/user-event @testing-library/jest-dom jest jest-environment-jsdom -D`: This command installs additional packages required for the project:
    *   `react-router-dom`: For routing in React applications.
    *   `@reduxjs/toolkit` and `react-redux`: For state management using Redux.
    *   `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/user-event`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`: For testing React components.
    *   `jest` and `jest-environment-jsdom`: For running unit tests in a browser-like environment.
    *   `-D`:  Saves these packages as devDependencies, as they are primarily used for development and testing.

### package.json:
