# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all required technologies are present: Vite, TypeScript, React, Redux, and React Router  
  All these technologies are present in the configuration. Vite is used for bundling, TypeScript is configured using tsconfig files, React is included along with React DOM, Redux is integrated via @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux, and React Router is provided by react-router-dom.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm documentation includes all available CLI commands with explanations for each command's purpose  
  The CLI commands section in the documentation clearly explains npm/yarn scripts for dev, build, preview, test, and test:watch, along with their respective purposes and usage instructions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that package.json includes all necessary dependencies for the required technologies  
  The package.json lists all necessary dependencies (React, Redux, React Router) and the devDependencies include TypeScript, Jest, React Testing Library, and Vite plugins, ensuring a complete dependency setup.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the project contains complete configuration files without placeholder comments or TODOs  
  All configuration files (package.json, vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json, tsconfig.node.json, jest.config.js) are complete, detailed, and free of placeholder comments or TODO markers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the presence of proper TypeScript type definitions throughout the project  
  TypeScript is fully integrated: type definitions are provided in interfaces (e.g., HelloWorldProps), and devDependencies include @types/react and @types/react-dom, ensuring comprehensive type safety.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure testing library configuration is complete with necessary setup files  
  Testing is configured with Jest and React Testing Library. The jest.config.js and src/test/setupTests.ts files are present and correctly set up to extend jest-dom and support the testing framework.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the project structure includes directories for components, state management, and routing  
  The project structure clearly features directories for components, features (state management), pages (routing), and tests, following an organized and modular pattern.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the entry point files for the application are properly defined  
  The main entry point is defined in src/main.tsx, with supporting files like App.tsx and proper folder structure, ensuring that the application starts as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all configuration follows established best practices for each technology  
  The configuration files (Vite, TypeScript, Jest) follow standard best practices, including proper module resolution, strict type checking, and clear script definitions in package.json.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that build and environment configuration supports production deployment  
  The build script in package.json (combining tsc and vite build) and the production preview command ensure that the project is properly prepared for production deployment.
