# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### REST Factory Tests

1. **Pass**: Validate that the unit tests for the REST factory (rest.spec.js) are correctly written.
2. **Pass**: Ensure that the REST factory tests cover all defined resources.
3. **Fail**: Ensure that the REST factory tests include a check for correct GET request URLs.
    - The tests check for the creation of `$resource` but do not explicitly verify the GET request URLs.

### Page Factory Tests

4. **Pass**: Validate that the unit tests for the Page factory (page.spec.js) are correctly written.
5. **Pass**: Ensure that the Page factory tests initialize all properties correctly.

### Users Factory Tests

6. **Pass**: Validate that the unit tests for the Users factory (users.spec.js) are correctly written.
7. **Pass**: Ensure that the Users factory tests initialize all properties correctly.

### Page Controller Tests

8. **Pass**: Validate that the unit tests for the page controller (pageCtrl.spec.js) are correctly written.
9. **Pass**: Ensure that the pageCtrl tests initialize all scope variables correctly.
10. **Pass**: Ensure that the pageCtrl tests update page variables on the contentGet event.
11. **Pass**: Ensure that the pageCtrl tests save page data locally.
12. **Pass**: Ensure that the pageCtrl tests autocomplete tags correctly.
13. **Pass**: Ensure that the pageCtrl tests select tags from suggestions correctly.
14. **Pass**: Ensure that the pageCtrl tests save pages correctly.
15. **Pass**: Ensure that the tests cover both positive and negative scenarios.
16. **Pass**: Verify that the tests for the savePage function in pageCtrl handle both new and duplicate pages.

## Summary

- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 16
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 15
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 1

The unit tests are generally well-written and cover most of the required scenarios. However, there is a missing check for correct GET request URLs in the REST factory tests. This should be addressed to ensure comprehensive test coverage.
