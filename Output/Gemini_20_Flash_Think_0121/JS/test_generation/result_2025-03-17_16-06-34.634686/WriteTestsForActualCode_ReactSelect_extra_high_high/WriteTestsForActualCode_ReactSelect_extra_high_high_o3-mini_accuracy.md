# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up in the test file  
  The test file imports the necessary modules from React Testing Library (render, screen, fireEvent, waitFor) and Jest (jest.fn()), indicating that the environment is correctly configured for testing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test cases are properly isolated and do not have interdependencies  
  The test cases are organized within nested describe and it blocks, ensuring clear separation and isolation of individual tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that DOM events are simulated using proper React Testing Library methods  
  The code correctly uses fireEvent and waitFor to simulate events such as mouse clicks, keyboard inputs, and touch events.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that accessibility attributes are being tested appropriately  
  The tests verify ARIA attributes like aria-expanded, aria-haspopup, role attributes, and active descendant management, ensuring accessibility aspects are covered.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure mocks are used for external dependencies where appropriate  
  Mocks are utilized for props such as onChange and onInputChange via jest.fn(), ensuring that external dependency behaviors are simulated in isolation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of async/await for asynchronous testing where needed  
  Asynchronous behavior is handled well using waitFor and async functions in scenarios where UI updates or delayed responses occur.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all assertions use appropriate Jest matchers  
  The test cases use relevant Jest matchers such as toBeInTheDocument, toHaveAttribute, toHaveBeenCalledTimes, and toEqual, ensuring clear and reliable assertions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that tests include proper cleanup after each test case  
  Although explicit cleanup methods are not present, React Testing Library automatically cleans up after each test, satisfying this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test descriptions clearly indicate what functionality is being tested  
  Descriptive names for both describe and it blocks clearly outline the purpose of each test, making it easy to understand the functionality being verified.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the test file follows best practices for organizing test cases (describe/it blocks)  
  The tests are well organized into logical describe blocks for different functionalities, ensuring clarity and maintainability.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that all event handlers are tested using appropriate simulation methods  
  Both mouse and keyboard events are simulated properly using fireEvent, and the test cases cover various event handler scenarios, ensuring reliable event simulation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the test environment correctly simulates both mouse and keyboard interactions  
  The tests simulate mouse events (mouseDown, click), keyboard events (Enter, Arrow keys, Escape, Tab, Backspace), and even touch events, confirming that both interaction types are robustly tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for touch events properly simulate mobile interactions  
  The test for touch events uses fireEvent.touchStart to simulate a mobile interaction, ensuring that touch capabilities are addressed appropriately.
