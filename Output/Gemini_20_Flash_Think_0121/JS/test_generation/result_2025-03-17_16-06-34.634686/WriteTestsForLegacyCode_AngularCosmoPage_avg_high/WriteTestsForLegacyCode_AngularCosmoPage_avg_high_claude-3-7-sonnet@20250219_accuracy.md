# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)
  
  The tests are using Jasmine as the testing framework and Karma as the test runner, which is evident from the `describe`, `it`, `beforeEach`, `inject`, `expect`, and spy functions like `spyOn`. The karma.conf.js file also confirms this setup.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints
  
  The tests properly mock $resource by injecting it and using spies. For example, in rest.test.js, there's a spy on $resource.call. In pageCtrl.test.js, multiple REST service methods are mocked using spyOn for $save, $update, $delete, and $query operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation
  
  All test files use `beforeEach` hooks to set up the testing environment before each test. For example, they use `beforeEach(module('cosmo'))` to load the module and `beforeEach(inject(...))` to inject dependencies and set up mocks.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls
  
  All HTTP requests are properly mocked. In pageCtrl.test.js, methods like REST.content.$save, REST.content.$update, and REST.contentTags.$query are mocked using spyOn and configured to return promises that resolve to mock data.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection
  
  The tests correctly use AngularJS's dependency injection pattern. Each test file uses the `inject` function to inject required services like _REST_, _Page_, _$location_, _$rootScope_, etc., with proper underscores to handle minification issues.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations
  
  The tests handle promises correctly. For example, in pageCtrl.test.js, REST service methods are mocked to return objects with $promise properties that resolve to mock data. The tests also include $rootScope.$digest() to resolve promises during testing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies
  
  Spies and mocks are used extensively. For example, `spyOn(REST.content, '$save')`, `spyOn($location, 'path')`, and `jasmine.createSpyObj('localStorage', ['getItem', 'setItem', 'removeItem', 'clear'])` all demonstrate proper use of spies to mock external dependencies.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization
  
  All tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization. There are parent describes for components (e.g., "pageCtrl") and nested describes for logical groupings of tests (e.g., "Initialization", "savePage", etc.).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls
  
  Tests cover both success and error scenarios. For example, in pageCtrl.test.js, there are tests for successful page saving as well as tests that mock rejection scenarios: `REST.content.$save.and.returnValue({$promise: Promise.reject('error')})`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate
  
  The tests simulate user interactions by calling controller methods that would be triggered by user actions. For example, `$scope.titleChange()`, `$scope.savePage()`, `$scope.selectSuggestion('testTag')`, etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage
  
  The tests use beforeEach to set up fresh instances of controllers, services, and scopes for each test, which helps prevent state leakage between tests. No explicit afterEach hooks are needed because the setup pattern isolates each test.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested
  
  The test descriptions are clear and descriptive. For example, "should update Page.title and auto-generate URL for new pages", "should save page properties to Page factory and localStorage", etc., clearly explain what functionality is being tested.
