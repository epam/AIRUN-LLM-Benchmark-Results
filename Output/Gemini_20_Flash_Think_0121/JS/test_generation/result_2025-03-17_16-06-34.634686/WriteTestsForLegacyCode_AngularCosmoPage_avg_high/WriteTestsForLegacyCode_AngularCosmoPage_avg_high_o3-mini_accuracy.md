# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)  
  The tests use Jasmine (with Karma as the test runner) along with AngularJS mocks, which qualifies as a modern testing framework.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints  
  The tests spy on the $resource methods (e.g., spyOn($resource, 'call')) and simulate REST API endpoints accurately using AngularJS dependency injection.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation  
  The tests consistently use beforeEach to initialize modules and dependencies, ensuring that the environment is properly set up and isolated for each test.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls  
  While no explicit $httpBackend is used, the tests simulate API calls by returning promises from mocked REST service methods. The absence of real HTTP requests is effectively ensured via these mocks.  
  (Slight uncertainty due to the lack of explicit HTTP backend mocking, but the promises and spies mitigate real API interactions.)

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection  
  The tests use AngularJS’s inject method to properly retrieve dependencies (e.g., REST, Page, Users) and use module('cosmo') to configure the testing environment.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations  
  The test suite returns promises (using Promise.resolve/reject) and manually calls $rootScope.$digest() in error handling tests to force resolution. Although the handling is effective, more explicit async handling (e.g., async/await in modern tests) could provide additional clarity.  
  (Confidence is high but not absolute because of some reliance on $digest rather than fully modern async patterns.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies  
  The tests employ spyOn for $resource, localStorage, and REST method calls, ensuring that external dependencies are properly mocked.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization  
  All tests are structured under describe blocks with individual it test cases, promoting clear and organized test reporting.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls  
  The tests include cases for successful REST calls as well as error handling in both save and update operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate  
  Methods such as titleChange, descriptionChange, and URL changes are simulated to mimic user interactions with the page.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage  
  The use of beforeEach for dependency injection helps reset the state between tests. While there are no explicit afterEach hooks, the structure leverages AngularJS’s testing features to mitigate state leakage.  
  (Confidence is high, though explicit afterEach hooks could further improve clarity on cleanup.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested  
  The naming conventions in describe and it blocks are descriptive and clearly reflect the purpose of each test.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible  
  The tests focus on the outcomes (e.g., changes in scope properties, navigation paths, broadcast messages) rather than internal implementations, ensuring robustness and maintainability.
