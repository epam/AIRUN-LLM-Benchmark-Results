# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources  
  The REST factory tests check for the existence of each resource endpoint and validate that $resource is called with the expected parameters for all defined endpoints.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly  
  The Page factory tests confirm that all expected properties (id, title, description, header, subheader, body, url, type, published, published_date, themePages, timestamp, extras, and misc) are correctly initialized.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly  
  The Users factory tests clearly check that all properties (id, username, name, bio, email, facebook, twitter, photo, role) are properly set.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods  
  The tests for the pageCtrl controller comprehensively cover methods such as initialization, local storage handling, titleChange, descriptionChange, urlChange, saveLocal, autocompleteTags, selectSuggestion, savePage, deletePage, and updatePageType.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller  
  Multiple tests in the “Initialization” section validate that the page is created correctly from the Page factory, including handling of new pages and the proper assignment of initial data.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation  
  The titleChange tests check the auto-generation of the URL from the title when autoURL is enabled and ensure that the URL remains unchanged when auto-generation is disabled.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction  
  The saveLocal tests validate that page properties are correctly saved both in the Page factory and in localStorage with the expected keys and values.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality  
  Tests for autocompleteTags verify that when tags are provided, the function calls REST.contentTags.$query; and when no tag is provided, the suggestions array is correctly set to empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)  
  The savePage tests cover conditions for duplicate saves, missing page type or URL, saving a new page, updating an existing page, and handling errors during both save and update operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types  
  Edge cases, such as when no URL is provided or when page type is null, are effectively tested and appropriate error notifications are verified.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly  
  The deletePage tests correctly simulate deleting the page and associated data via the REST service, and also verify the subsequent redirection and notification.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions  
  The tests for checking newer versions from localStorage and the functions localVersion and deleteNewerVersion ensure that page versioning and localStorage interactions are handled correctly.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components  
  Although there are extensive tests covering many application pathways (suggesting high code coverage), the actual threshold of 80% is not directly measurable in the provided context. Based on the breadth and depth of tests, it appears that this goal is met; however, without an explicit coverage metric output, we assign a 90% confidence level.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling  
  The tests confirm that events (such as 'contentGet', 'settingsGet', and 'notify') are broadcast when the appropriate actions occur in the controller.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality  
  The tests thoroughly cover how published_date is handled when publishing now, using an existing date, and scheduling for a future date; including handling of past schedule dates.
