# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest or another suitable testing framework is properly configured for React testing  
  The tests use Jest functions (describe, it), along with React Testing Library, which confirms that a suitable testing framework is in place.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests use proper mocking techniques for API calls rather than making real network requests  
  The code uses jest.mock to mock the API module (../api) and also mocks specific action creators from the auth actions. This ensures no real network requests are made during tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that form validation logic tests cover both synchronous and asynchronous validation scenarios  
  There are multiple tests that validate synchronous behavior (returning errors for invalid inputs or an empty object for valid values) as well as several async tests that check responses for taken names/emails and API error handling.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that test assertions properly check component rendering, state changes, and event handling  
  The tests assert that the correct elements (headings, input fields, buttons, and links) render and that user interactions update field values and trigger form submission.  
  Note: The usage of getByRole('password', { name: /Password/i }) is somewhat unconventional since inputs of type password might not automatically receive a role of "password" in certain configurations. This could impact the test's reliability in some setups, reducing our confidence slightly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test doubles or mocks are used for Redux store interactions  
  The component tests use a mocked Redux store (via redux-mock-store) and wrap the tested component with the Provider, ensuring that Redux interactions are fully mocked.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests properly handle asynchronous operations with appropriate wait/async patterns  
  Asynchronous operations in form validation and submission are handled using async/await, act, and waitFor, ensuring that async updates complete before assertions are made.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that form submission handling tests check both success and error paths  
  The tests simulate both a successful signup (verifying that the signupComplete action is dispatched) and a failure scenario (ensuring it is not dispatched when the API call fails), covering both paths.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests verify proper rendering of form elements and error messages under different conditions  
  Several tests verify rendering of correct elements, proper updating of form fields upon user input, and the display (or absence) of error messages based on field state â€“ both for touched fields showing errors and for untouched fields.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests follow a consistent, readable structure with descriptive test names  
  The tests are grouped into logical describe blocks (by component and functionality) with descriptive test names that clearly state what behavior is being verified.

- **Fail** (85%): Ensure tests achieve the specified 80% minimum code coverage across all files  
  While the tests are comprehensive for the Signup and FormGroup components, there is no evidence or configuration regarding code coverage (such as a coverage report or specific configuration enforcing an 80% threshold). This makes it unclear if the entire codebase meets the 80% minimum code coverage requirement. Our confidence is slightly lower because we have to assume that other parts of the project are similarly covered without explicit confirmation.
