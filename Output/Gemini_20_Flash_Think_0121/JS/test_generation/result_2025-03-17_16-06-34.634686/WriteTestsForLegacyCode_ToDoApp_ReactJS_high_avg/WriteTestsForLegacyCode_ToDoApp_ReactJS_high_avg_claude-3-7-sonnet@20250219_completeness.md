# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering
- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events
- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts
- **Fail** (90%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation

    Although the footer.test.tsx file is present and includes basic rendering tests, it does not specifically test filter navigation functionality. There should be tests that verify clicking on filter links changes the active filter and updates the UI accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
- **Fail** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation

    There is no dedicated utils.ts test file in the provided diffs. The todoModel.test.ts mocks the Utils module but doesn't specifically test the uuid generation functionality in a dedicated utils test file.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality

    There is no dedicated utils.ts test file in the provided diffs to test the pluralize functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations

    There is no dedicated utils.ts test file in the provided diffs to test store (localStorage) operations, although localStorage is mocked in todoModel.test.ts.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function

    There is no dedicated utils.ts test file in the provided diffs to test the extend function, although it is mocked in todoModel.test.ts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx
- **Pass** (90%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data

    The tests use mock todo data, but there isn't a centralized test fixture system. Instead, mock todos are defined inline within each test file. However, this approach is consistent and the mock data serves its purpose.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented
