# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering  
  The tests in "app.test.tsx" successfully render the TodoApp component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos  
  The test "should call addTodo on ENTER_KEY press with input value and clear input" confirms that adding new todos is properly tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos  
  The test "should call toggleAll with correct checked value" in "app.test.tsx" covers toggling all todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos  
  The test "should filter todos based on nowShowing state" confirms that filtering functionality is checked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The test "should call clearCompleted" in "app.test.tsx" validates the clearing completed todos functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering  
  The basic rendering tests in "todoItem.test.tsx" confirm that the TodoItem component renders correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos  
  Multiple tests in "todoItem.test.tsx" cover toggling (onToggle), destroying (onDestroy) and editing functionalities.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events  
  The tests that simulate keyboard events (ENTER_KEY and ESCAPE_KEY) demonstrate proper handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts  
  "footer.test.tsx" includes tests that check correct item counts and proper rendering.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation  
  There is no explicit test in "footer.test.tsx" that validates filter navigation functionality.  
  (Missing tests for clicking or navigating between filters indicate that the routing changes in the footer are not verified.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The test in "footer.test.tsx" for clicking the "Clear completed" button confirms this functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos  
  Although tests for adding and toggling todos are present, tests for saving and destroying todos are absent from the provided "todoModel.test.ts" diff.  
  (This omission leads to a failure in fully covering these functionalities.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions  
  The tests checking the subscribe and inform behaviors in "todoModel.test.ts" are present and adequate.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  There is no distinct test in the "todoModel.test.ts" file that verifies the clear completed functionality.  
  (While the TodoApp tests do check clearCompleted via the model, a dedicated test in todoModel.ts is not provided.)

- **Fail** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation  
  No tests for uuid generation are visible in the provided diffs, indicating that this functionality is not directly tested.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality  
  There is no evidence of tests covering the pluralize functionality in utils.ts in the provided content.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations  
  Although localStorage is mocked and used in todoModel tests, there is no dedicated test suite for the store operations in utils.ts.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function  
  Tests focused on the extend function in utils.ts are not present in the provided diffs.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx  
  All test files adhere to the "[filename].test.tsx" naming convention, as seen with app.test.tsx, footer.test.tsx, todoItem.test.tsx, and todoModel.test.ts.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data  
  Sample todo data, for example { id: '1', title: 'Todo 1', completed: false }, is consistently used across tests as fixtures.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented  
  The tests in "app.test.tsx" include checks for Router initialization and verify that the routing callbacks are correctly provided via mocks.
