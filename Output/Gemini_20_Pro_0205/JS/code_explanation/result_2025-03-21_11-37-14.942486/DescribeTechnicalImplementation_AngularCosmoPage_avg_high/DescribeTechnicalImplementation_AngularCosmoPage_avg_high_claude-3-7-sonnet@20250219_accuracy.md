# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies Angular.js as the framework used
  
  The documentation correctly identifies Angular.js as the framework used throughout the document. It mentions "built with Angular.js" in the initial overview and consistently refers to Angular.js components, directives, and services such as `$resource`, `$scope`, `ng-controller`, etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all factories (REST, Page, Users) are accurately documented with their purposes
  
  The documentation accurately describes all three factories:
  - REST Factory: "Handles all communication with the backend RESTful API" and "defines resources for various data entities"
  - Page Factory: "Acts as a global store for the current page's data"
  - Users Factory: "Stores data about the currently logged-in user"
  
  Each factory's purpose and function is clearly explained.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of the Page controller and its functionality is technically accurate
  
  The documentation accurately describes the pageCtrl controller as managing "the user interface and logic for creating, editing, and deleting pages." It correctly explains the controller's dependencies, key functions, and how it interacts with the factories.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the RESTful API endpoints are correctly documented
  
  The documentation correctly identifies and lists the RESTful API endpoints handled by the REST factory, including blocks, comments, content, files, users, and others. It also accurately describes the methods supported by each resource (query, get, save, update, delete) with their HTTP verb equivalents.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of Angular module dependencies ($resource, $location, etc.) is correct
  
  The documentation correctly explains Angular module dependencies in section 2.4 where it lists the dependencies for pageCtrl: "$scope, REST, $location, Page, $rootScope, $routeParams, $upload, Users, $translate." It also references Angular's "$resource" service when explaining the REST factory implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the page management features (creating, editing, deleting) are accurately described
  
  The documentation accurately describes page management features, including:
  - Creating pages via the savePage function
  - Editing existing pages, also through the savePage function
  - Deleting pages via the deletePage function
  
  It explains how these functions interact with the backend API through the REST factory.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately explains how the local storage mechanism works
  
  The documentation accurately explains the local storage mechanism as providing "a basic 'draft' feature, allowing users to recover unsaved changes." It correctly identifies the relevant functions (localVersion, deleteNewerVersion, saveLocal) and explains that localStorage is used to store draft versions of pages.

- **Pass** (90%): Check that the description of form validation logic is technically accurate
  
  The documentation does not provide an explicit section on form validation logic. While it mentions character counters for title and description inputs, it doesn't detail any validation rules or error handling for invalid inputs. The documentation is not incorrect, but it's incomplete regarding form validation specifics.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of publish/schedule date handling is correct
  
  The documentation correctly explains that the application supports three publication states: published ('Y'), draft ('N'), and scheduled ('schedule'). It mentions the date/time picker for scheduling and correctly identifies that the page.html template includes "Publish/Draft/Schedule Radio Buttons: Allows the user to choose the publication status of the page. Includes a date/time picker for scheduling."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the tag management and autocomplete feature explanation is technically accurate
  
  The documentation accurately describes the tag management and autocomplete features, including the autocompleteTags function that "provides tag suggestions based on user input" and the selectSuggestion function that "adds a selected tag suggestion to the page's tags." It also correctly mentions that the page.html template has a "Tags Input: A text input for tags, with autocomplete suggestions."

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the relationship between controllers, factories, and templates is accurately explained
  
  The documentation clearly explains how these components interact: "The REST factory acts as the data access layer, abstracting API calls. The Page and Users factories serve as the application's model, holding data. The pageCtrl acts as the controller, mediating between the model and the view (page.html
