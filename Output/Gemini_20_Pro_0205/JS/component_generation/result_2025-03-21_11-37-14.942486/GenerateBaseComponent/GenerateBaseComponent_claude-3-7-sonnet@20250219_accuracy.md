# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x
  
  The component imports from React and uses React 18 compatible function component syntax with hooks like useState, useRef, and useEffect. The imports at the top of the file include React from 'react' and the component is defined as a functional component using React.FC type.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
  
  The code uses TypeScript throughout with proper interfaces defined for Option and SearchableSelectProps. All event handlers are properly typed with TypeScript event types such as KeyboardEvent, ChangeEvent, and FocusEvent. Type annotations are used for refs (useRef<HTMLDivElement>, useRef<HTMLInputElement>) and the component itself (React.FC<SearchableSelectProps>).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling
  
  The CSS file is included and imported at the top of the component file with `import './index.css';`. The CSS file contains appropriate styles for the searchable select component, including the container, input, dropdown options, and various states (highlighted, selected).

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments
  
  The code is well-organized, properly formatted, and doesn't contain any TODO comments or debugging code. All functionality is implemented and there are no placeholder elements.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility
  
  The component uses useState hooks to manage state for:
  - isOpen (dropdown visibility)
  - searchText (current search input)
  - highlightedIndex (currently highlighted option)
  
  State updates are handled properly through appropriate handler functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props
  
  The component accepts several props that make it customizable:
  - options (array of options to select from)
  - value (currently selected value)
  - onChange (callback for selection changes)
  - placeholder (customizable placeholder text)
  - id (for accessibility and testing)
  - aria-label (for accessibility)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection
  
  The component implements keyboard navigation with:
  - ArrowDown/ArrowUp for navigating through options
  - Enter for selecting the highlighted option
  - Escape for closing the dropdown
  
  The handleKeyDown function handles all keyboard interactions appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions
  
  The component uses useRef hooks properly:
  - containerRef for detecting clicks outside
  - inputRef for managing focus
  
  DOM interactions are handled through event handlers rather than direct DOM manipulation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques
  
  Focus management is well-implemented:
  - Focus is returned to the input after selection
  - Focus is managed when closing with Escape key
  - The component handles blur events appropriately
  - Focus trapping within the component during keyboard navigation

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
  
  The component implements accessibility with ARIA attributes:
  - aria-label for describing the component
  - aria-autocomplete="list" on the input
  - aria-expanded to indicate dropdown state
  - aria-controls to associate the input with its listbox
  - role="combobox" on the input
  - role="listbox" on the options container
  - role="option" and aria-selected on individual options

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  There are no console.log, console.error, or similar debugging statements in the code. The code also doesn't contain patterns likely to produce React warnings like missing key props or invalid DOM nesting.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component
  
  The component manages state efficiently without unnecessary re-renders:
  - Event handlers are defined within the component body and don't need useCallback
  - useEffect dependencies are correctly specified
  - State updates are performed only when necessary
