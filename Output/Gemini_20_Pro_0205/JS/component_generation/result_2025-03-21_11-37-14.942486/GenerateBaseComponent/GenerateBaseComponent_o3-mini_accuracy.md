# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  The component is written as a functional component using hooks and TypeScript, which is consistent with React 18.x usage. However, since no explicit version-specific features (like createRoot) are employed, we assume it is compatible with React 18.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  The component uses TypeScript interfaces (e.g., Option, SearchableSelectProps) and types for refs, events, and props throughout the code, ensuring it adheres to TypeScript best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  The provided solution includes a separate index.css file with all necessary styles for the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  The code is well-structured, clean, and free of placeholder or TODO comments, making it production-ready.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  State management is handled using React’s useState hook for variables such as isOpen, searchText, and highlightedIndex. This approach is correct and efficient.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  The component is designed to be highly reusable, accepting props such as options, value, onChange, placeholder, id, and aria-label.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  Keyboard events (ArrowUp, ArrowDown, Enter, Escape) are properly handled, which supports efficient navigation and selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  The component uses useRef for managing direct DOM interactions and correctly implements focus management and event handling without compromising React’s best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  The code ensures focus is returned to the input element after selection or when closing the dropdown (using both keyboard events and onBlur handling), demonstrating proper focus management.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  Appropriate ARIA attributes such as role, aria-label, aria-expanded, aria-controls, aria-autocomplete, and aria-selected are applied to improve accessibility compliance.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  While a code inspection shows no obvious issues that would lead to console errors or warnings, actual runtime verification may be needed to ensure a completely error-free execution.  
  (Reason: Confidence is slightly less than 100% because testing in an actual browser environment is required to guarantee absence of runtime warnings.)

- **Pass** (80%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  The component structure appears optimized with proper usage of useState, useEffect, and useRef. However, without profiling in a live environment, there is some uncertainty regarding potential unnecessary re-renders.  
  (Reason: Confidence is 80% since deeper performance analysis or profiling would be necessary to fully rule out unintended re-renders.)
