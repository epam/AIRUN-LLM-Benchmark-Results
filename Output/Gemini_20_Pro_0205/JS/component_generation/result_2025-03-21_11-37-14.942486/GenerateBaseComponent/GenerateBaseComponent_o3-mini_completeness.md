# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The implementation renders a container with an input element and conditionally displays a list (dropdown) when opened.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  The component includes an input element that handles search text and filtering, fulfilling the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The onChange handler and the maintained state (value) indicate that only one item is selected at a time.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The code implements keyboard navigation using ArrowDown and ArrowUp keys to change the highlighted index.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  With the Enter key press, when an option is highlighted, the component calls handleSelect to select the item.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  The code explicitly toggles the dropdown open (using Enter) when the component (or its container) is focused and not already open.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  On dropdown close events (selection via Enter or Escape key), the component returns focus to the input element.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  Clicking on an item triggers handleSelect, which closes the dropdown by setting isOpen to false.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  The Enter key branch in the keydown handler invokes handleSelect, thereby closing the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  The Escape key is handled explicitly in the onKeyDown function to close the dropdown and clear the relevant state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  The useEffect hook adds an event listener to detect clicks outside the component and closes the dropdown accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  When the component (the container) is focused and the Enter key is pressed while the dropdown is closed, the dropdown opens.
