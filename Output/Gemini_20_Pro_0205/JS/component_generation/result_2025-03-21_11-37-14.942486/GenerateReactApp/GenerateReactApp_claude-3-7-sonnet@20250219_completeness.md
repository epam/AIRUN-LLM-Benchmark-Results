# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The application correctly fetches characters from the SWAPI endpoint (https://swapi.dev/api/people) using Axios in the `fetchCharacters` function, and then displays them in the `CharacterList` component using a map function that renders each character name in a list item.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The application includes a loading state that is initially set to `true` and displays "Loading characters..." while fetching data. The loading state is set to `false` in the `finally` block after the API call completes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The code maps through all characters received from the API response and renders each one as a list item with `character.name` as the displayed text. This ensures all fetched characters are displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  The application is a simple list display with no search inputs, filters, or other user input fields. It only displays the characters fetched from the API.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character is displayed in a list item (`<li>`) with its name correctly rendered using `{character.name}` within the `CharacterList` component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The application uses Create React App with TypeScript as shown in the setup instructions: `npx create-react-app swapi-character-list --template typescript`. The file structure and configuration files (like package.json) are consistent with a CRA setup.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The application uses React's `useState` hook to manage three states:
  - `characters` for the character data
  - `loading` for the loading indicator
  - `error` for error handling
  
  All states are properly initialized and updated based on the API response.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each list item has a unique key based on the character's URL: `<li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>`. This provides a stable, unique identifier for React's reconciliation process.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  The application handles different states appropriately:
  - Shows a loading indicator while fetching
  - Displays an error message if the fetch fails
  - If the API returns an empty array of characters, the list would be empty but not cause errors
