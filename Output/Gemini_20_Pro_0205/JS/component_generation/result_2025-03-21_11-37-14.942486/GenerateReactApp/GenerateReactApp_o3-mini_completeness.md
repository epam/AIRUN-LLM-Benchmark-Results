# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The CharacterList component successfully calls the fetchCharacters service and renders a list (an unordered list with each character’s name). This meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The component displays “Loading characters…” while waiting for the API call to complete, which satisfies the loading indicator requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  The code maps all items from the fetched characters array to list items, ensuring that every character is rendered.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  There are no search input elements or user-interactive components in the provided code, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each list item displays the character’s name (using character.name) as intended.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The setup instructions include using “npx create-react-app … --template typescript”, confirming that Create React App was used.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The CharacterList component utilizes state variables for characters, loading, and error, and updates them appropriately during the API call lifecycle.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  The code uses character.url as the unique key for each list item during mapping, which aligns with best practices for React lists.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  If the fetched character list is empty, the component will render an empty unordered list. While a dedicated “no data” message (e.g., “No characters found”) is not implemented, rendering an empty list is a reasonable way to handle an empty state. There is slight uncertainty (10%) because providing a user-friendly message for empty data might be considered a further improvement; however, the current behavior is acceptable within the requirements.
