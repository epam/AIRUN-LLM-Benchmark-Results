# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type
  
  The code implements an input field with an onChange handler that correctly captures user input and updates state via a debounced function.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls
  
  The code properly implements debouncing using lodash's debounce function with a 300ms delay, which falls within the required 300-500ms range.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured
  
  Axios is imported and correctly utilized for making API requests with proper configuration and error handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses
  
  The code uses TypeScript interfaces (Character, ApiResponse) and properly types state variables, function parameters, and component declarations.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters
  
  The API endpoint is correctly constructed with search parameters: `https://swapi.dev/api/people/?search=${query}`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate
  
  The code uses useCallback for fetchCharacters and debouncedSearch functions, and useMemo for displayedCharacters, demonstrating appropriate performance optimizations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback
  
  Error handling is implemented with try/catch in the fetchCharacters function, with errors logged to console. While there's a comment about potentially showing user-facing errors, the current implementation meets the basic requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing
  
  The debounced search implementation ensures that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing for 300ms.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices
  
  State management follows React best practices with separate state variables for characters, loading state, search query, and no results indicator.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code
  
  The code doesn't contain unused imports or commented-out code. There is one console.error statement, but it's used appropriately for error logging.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests
  
  Loading state is properly managed by setting loading to true before API requests and false after they complete (in the finally block).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns
  
  The component uses modern React patterns including functional components, hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo), and proper effect dependency arrays.
