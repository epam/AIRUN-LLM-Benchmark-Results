# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name

    The code includes an input field with a placeholder "Search characters..." that captures user input and uses it for filtering characters by name via the SWAPI API.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests

    The component displays "Loading..." when the `loading` state is true, which is set before API requests and cleared after they complete, providing visual feedback during data fetching.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query

    Initial data loading occurs in the useEffect hook that runs on component mount, calling fetchCharacters with an empty searchQuery, which fetches all characters initially.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type

    The code implements a debounced search mechanism (300ms delay) that updates the searchQuery state as users type, triggering the API call to fetch filtered results matching the input.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found

    The component shows "No characters found." when the `noResults` state is true, which is set when search results are empty and a search query exists.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design

    The search input has styling `width: '100%'` and `boxSizing: 'border-box'` which ensures it responsively takes up the full width of its container.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response

    The component renders an unordered list (`<ul>`) with list items (`<li>`) for each character in the `displayedCharacters` array, which is derived from the API response data.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed

    The code includes error handling in the fetchCharacters function using try/catch to log errors, but it does not display error messages to users or implement React Error Boundaries. While basic error handling is present, a more comprehensive approach would be ideal.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props

    The code defines TypeScript interfaces for Character, ApiResponse, and properly types all state variables and function parameters. The component is also correctly typed as React.FC.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities

    The code maintains the core functionality of displaying a list of Star Wars characters while adding search capabilities, with proper performance optimizations like debounce, useCallback, and useMemo.
