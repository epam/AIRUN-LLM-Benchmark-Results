# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type  
  The input element’s onChange handler calls handleSearchInputChange, which in turn invokes the debounced function to update the searchQuery state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls  
  The code uses lodash’s debounce with a 300ms delay inside a useCallback, effectively debouncing the search input.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured  
  Axios is imported and used with type annotations on the response (axios.get<ApiResponse>), ensuring proper configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses  
  The code defines interfaces for Character and ApiResponse and applies type annotations to state variables and function parameters.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters  
  The API endpoint concatenates the search query properly:  
  `https://swapi.dev/api/people/?search=${query}`, which meets the SWAPI specification.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate  
  Both useCallback (for fetchCharacters and debouncedSearch) and useMemo (for displayedCharacters) are used to optimize renders.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback  
  While a try…catch block is present and errors are logged with console.error, no user-facing error message is provided.  
  This might be acceptable in some contexts but does not satisfy the “appropriate user feedback” requirement fully.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing  
  The debounced search function delays updating the state until after 300ms of inactivity, ensuring API calls occur only after the user stops typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices  
  The component uses useState and useEffect hooks appropriately, with dependencies correctly specified, ensuring proper state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code  
  All imports are used and there is no extraneous commented-out code; only a comment explaining error logging is present.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests  
  The loading state is set to true before the API request and then reset to false in the finally block, ensuring correct UX feedback.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns  
  The component uses functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo), following modern React practices.
