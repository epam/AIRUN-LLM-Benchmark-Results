# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The code includes an input field with the placeholder “Search characters…” and an onChange handler that triggers the debounced search update.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  The component displays a “Loading…” message when the loading state is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  The initial state of searchQuery is an empty string and useEffect triggers fetchCharacters on mount, correctly fetching data.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  The debounced search mechanism updates the searchQuery state which in turn triggers a new API request via useEffect.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  The code handles the noResults state by displaying “No characters found.” when applicable.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The input field is styled with width set to 100% ensuring it adapts to its container.  
  Note: While the approach is minimal, it meets basic responsive design criteria. Confidence is slightly reduced because more sophisticated responsive design techniques could be applied.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  The character list is rendered after the API response by mapping over the displayedCharacters array.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  Although errors during the API call are caught and logged in the fetchCharacters function, no user-facing error boundary or fallback UI is implemented to handle rendering errors or display error messages.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The code properly defines the Character and ApiResponse interfaces and consistently applies TypeScript types throughout the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The integration of search capabilities does not interfere with the original functionality. Initial loading, data fetching, and results rendering occur as expected.
