# Evaluation Report

**Evaluation Steps:**

1. **Pass** - Confirm that constraints related to local storage limitations are noted.
    - The answer mentions that `localStorage` has size limitations (typically around 5-10MB).

2. **Pass** - Verify that assumptions about the application being designed for a single user are mentioned.
    - The answer states that the application is designed for a single user, as data is stored locally in the browser.

3. **Pass** - Ensure that browser compatibility assumptions are included.
    - The answer notes that the application is entirely browser-based and relies on `localStorage` for data storage, implying browser compatibility.

4. **Pass** - Check that performance-related constraints are noted.
    - The answer discusses performance constraints related to `localStorage` limitations and the need for a backend database for larger datasets.

5. **Pass** - Confirm that performance optimizations, such as the use of `shouldComponentUpdate`, are identified.
    - The answer identifies the use of `shouldComponentUpdate` in the `TodoItem` component to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

6. **Pass** - Verify that considerations for using immutable data structures for performance are mentioned.
    - The answer mentions the use of immutable data patterns (e.g., `map`, `filter`, `reduce`) when modifying the todo list.

7. **Pass** - Ensure scalability considerations related to local storage limitations are discussed.
    - The answer discusses the limitations of `localStorage` and the need for a different storage mechanism for a very large number of todos.

8. **Pass** - Check that the potential need for a backend service for better scalability is mentioned.
    - The answer mentions that to support multiple users and larger datasets, a backend server and database would be required.

9. **Pass** - Confirm that the evaluation steps are unambiguous and concise.
    - The evaluation steps are clear and concise, allowing for straightforward assessment.

10. **Pass** - Ensure that each step allows the evaluator to assess the output based solely on the provided code.
    - Each step is designed to be assessed based on the provided code and the analysis in the answer.

11. **Pass** - Verify that the steps are clearly articulated and cover all main points of the task.
    - The steps are clearly articulated and cover all the main points of the task.

**Summary:**

- **Total Steps Evaluated:** 11
- **Number of Passed Steps:** 11
- **Number of Failed Steps:** 0
