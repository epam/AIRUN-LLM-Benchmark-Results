# Evaluation Report

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.**
   - **Pass**: All imports in `signup.component.ts` and `signup.component.html` are used.

2. **Ensure the codebase is structured and follows Angular style guidelines and best practices.**
   - **Pass**: The code follows Angular style guidelines, including the use of `@Component`, `OnInit`, `OnDestroy`, and reactive forms.

3. **Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of Angular and TypeScript.**
   - **Pass**: The code uses modern Angular features such as standalone components and reactive forms, which are compatible with the latest Angular and TypeScript versions.

4. **Verify the application works correctly across modern browsers.**
   - **Not Evaluated**: This step requires running the application in different browsers, which is not possible in this static evaluation.

5. **Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.**
   - **Not Evaluated**: This step requires running the application and checking the console, which is not possible in this static evaluation.

6. **Ensure the code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility.**
   - **Pass**: The `SignupComponent` is focused on the signup functionality, adhering to the single responsibility principle.

7. **Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.**
   - **Pass**: The code does not contain any noticeable duplicates and follows DRY principles.

8. **Ensure the application handles API errors.**
   - **Pass**: The `onSubmit` method includes a catch block to handle API errors.

9. **Validate that @ngrx/store is used for state management and that the state is properly defined in auth.reducer.ts and app.state.ts.**
   - **Not Evaluated**: This step requires checking the `auth.reducer.ts` and `app.state.ts` files, which are not provided.

10. **Verify the UI and UX by running the Angular application and ensuring that the signup form behaves as expected, including form validation and error messages.**
    - **Not Evaluated**: This step requires running the application, which is not possible in this static evaluation.

11. **Confirm that the signup action is correctly dispatched from the SignupComponent upon form submission.**
    - **Pass**: The `signupComplete` action is dispatched upon successful form submission.

12. **Verify app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of Angular framework.**
    - **Pass**: The code does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of Angular's framework.

13. **Verify app does not overuse Angular references for DOM access instead of Angular state and props.**
    - **Pass**: The code uses Angular's reactive forms and state management properly without overusing DOM references.

14. **Check that there are no TODOs or incomplete parts in the code.**
    - **Pass**: There are no TODOs or incomplete parts in the provided code.

### Summary

- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 14
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 10
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 0
- **Number of Not Evaluated Steps**: 4

Overall, the provided code is well-structured, follows best practices, and appears to be functional based on the static evaluation. However, some steps require running the application to fully verify.
