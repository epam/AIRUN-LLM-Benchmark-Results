# Evaluation Report

## Steps

### Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
- **Pass**: The `App` component includes an input field with the class `new-todo`. The `handleNewTodoKeyDown` function handles the `Enter` key press, trims the input value, and dispatches the `addTodo` action to the store.

### Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
- **Pass**: The `App` component uses the `selectFilteredTodos` selector to get the filtered todos from the state and maps over them to display each `TodoItem`.

### Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
- **Pass**: The `App` component includes a checkbox with the id `toggle-all`. The `handleToggleAll` function dispatches the `toggleAll` action to the store when the checkbox is changed.

### Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItem` component includes functionality to toggle (`handleToggle`), edit (`handleEdit`, `handleSubmit`, `handleKeyDown`, `handleChange`), and delete (`handleDestroy`) a todo item. These functions dispatch the corresponding actions to the store.

### Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItem` component starts editing on double-click (`handleEdit`), submits the edit on Enter key press (`handleKeyDown`), and resets the edit on Esc key press (`handleKeyDown`).

### Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFooter` component displays the count of active items using the `count` prop, includes filter links that dispatch the `setNowShowing` action, and has a button to clear completed items that calls the `onClearCompleted` function.

### Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFooter` component includes a button with the class `clear-completed` that calls the `onClearCompleted` function, which is passed as a prop from the `App` component and dispatches the `clearCompleted` action.
