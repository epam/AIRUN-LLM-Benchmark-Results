### Step 1: Verify the application contains a button container with "Notes" and "Letters" buttons.

### Step 2: Verify the application renders piano keys for both natural and sharp notes.
- **Pass**: The application renders piano keys for both natural and sharp notes. The `keys` and `sharpKeys` arrays in `App.tsx` define the natural and sharp notes respectively.

### Step 3: Verify clicking on a piano key plays the correct sound and highlights the key.
- **Pass**: Clicking on a piano key plays the correct sound and highlights the key. This is handled by the `playSound` function and the `piano-key-active` class in `App.tsx`.

### Step 4: Verify releasing the mouse button or moving the cursor out of the key stops the sound and removes the highlight.
- **Pass**: Releasing the mouse button or moving the cursor out of the key stops the sound and removes the highlight. This is managed by the `stopSound` function and the `onMouseUp`, `onMouseLeave`, and `onMouseEnter` event handlers in `App.tsx`.

### Step 5: Verify pressing and releasing keyboard keys play and stop the corresponding piano notes.
- **Pass**: Pressing and releasing keyboard keys play and stop the corresponding piano notes. This is handled by the `handleKeyDown` and `handleKeyUp` functions in `App.tsx`.

### Step 6: Verify clicking the "Notes" button displays note names on the keys.
- **Pass**: Clicking the "Notes" button displays note names on the keys. This is managed by the `toggleDisplayMode` function and the `displayMode` state in `App.tsx`.

### Step 7: Verify clicking the "Letters" button displays letter names on the keys.
- **Pass**: Clicking the "Letters" button displays letter names on the keys. This is managed by the `toggleDisplayMode` function and the `displayMode` state in `App.tsx`.

### Step 8: Verify the fullscreen button toggles fullscreen mode for the application.
