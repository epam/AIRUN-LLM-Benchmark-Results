# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented
  
  The code provides comprehensive page management functionality. The `savePage` async thunk in pageSlice.ts handles both creation and updating based on the `duplicate` parameter. The `deletePage` async thunk handles page deletion. The PageForm component includes UI buttons and handlers for saving, duplicating, and deleting pages with corresponding functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present
  
  Page type selection functionality is implemented in the PageForm component with a select dropdown populated by the themePages array. The `handleTypeChange` function updates the selected page type in both local state and Redux store.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists
  
  URL auto-generation from the title is implemented in the `handleTitleChange` function. When `autoURL` is true, it converts the title to a URL-friendly format by replacing spaces with hyphens and removing special characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented
  
  Tag management is fully implemented with the `handleTagsChange` function that updates tags in the local and global state. The `fetchTagSuggestions` async thunk retrieves tag suggestions from the API. The UI renders tag suggestions and allows users to click on them to add tags.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available
  
  The code includes radio buttons for publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) with corresponding state management in the `handlePublishChange` function.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented
  
  Scheduled publishing date functionality is present with a datetime-local input that appears when the 'schedule' option is selected. The `handleScheduleDateChange` function updates the schedule date in both local and Redux state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present
  
  The code implements local storage versioning with comparison and restoration features. It checks for newer versions in local storage, provides UI for comparing or discarding them, and includes functions (`handleUseLocalVersion` and `handleDiscardNewerVersion`) to handle these actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented
  
  The code uses the `react-toastify` library for notifications. Success and error toast notifications are displayed for various actions such as saving, deleting, and error conditions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present
  
  Form validation is implemented in the `handleSave` function, which checks if the page type is selected and if the URL is present and not set to 'new'. If validation fails, error notifications are shown to the user.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled
  
  All API endpoints from api.ts are properly utilized throughout the application. The functions for content operations (getContentByUrl, createContent, updateContent, deleteContent), content revisions, content extras, content revisions extras, and content tags are all used in the appropriate contexts.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented
  
  Extras management is implemented in the `handleSave` function, which processes extras data from the page object and saves it using the createContentExtra and createContentRevisionsExtra API functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained
  
  Revision history functionality is implemented in the `handleSave` function, which creates a new revision when saving a page using the createContentRevision API function.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components
  
  The code follows a well-organized structure with feature folders. Business logic is primarily contained in the pageSlice.ts file, which includes Redux state management, actions, and async thunks. UI components are separated into React components like PageForm.tsx.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved
  
  Translation functionality is preserved using the react-i18next library. The `useTranslation` hook is used in the PageForm component to access translation functions, and translation keys are used throughout the code for UI text elements.

- **Pass** (95
