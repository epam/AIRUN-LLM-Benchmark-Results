# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props  
  All files use TypeScript and most variables, function parameters, and props are explicitly typed. There is room to further tighten typings in some API functions, but overall the implementation meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management  
  The code uses Redux Toolkit’s createSlice (in pageSlice.ts) to define reducers and actions for global state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components  
  Components such as PageForm are implemented as functional components using React.FC.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately  
  The component uses hooks like useState, useEffect, and useCallback appropriately. Although useMemo isn’t used, it does not appear necessary for the current implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource  
  The API functions use the browser’s fetch API to communicate with the backend, fulfilling this criterion.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components  
  The PageForm component manages form inputs with state (value and onChange), ensuring they are controlled components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation  
  React Router is used via BrowserRouter, useNavigate, and useParams in the code, which confirms proper setup for navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization  
  The implementation uses i18next (via react-i18next) for internationalization.

- **Fail** (90%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization  
  There is no evidence of code splitting or lazy loading (e.g., using React.lazy or dynamic imports) in the provided code. This might be addressed later, so the assessment is based on the current snippet.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations  
  The code does not demonstrate usage of React.memo to optimize expensive rendering operations. If there were components that would benefit from memoization, they are not wrapped with React.memo.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks  
  Most hooks include appropriate dependency arrays. There is a slight potential for improvement (e.g., ensuring that all referenced values in useCallback are present), but overall the usage is correct.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models  
  Interfaces for data models like Page and ContentTag are defined cleanly in the types files.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state  
  Selectors (e.g., selectPage, selectThemePages) are defined and appropriately used in the components.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations  
  Action creators are automatically generated within createSlice and are used for state mutations.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks  
  Local storage usage is implemented via helper functions inside the component. While it works correctly, it could be improved by encapsulating the logic in a custom hook for a cleaner separation of concerns.
