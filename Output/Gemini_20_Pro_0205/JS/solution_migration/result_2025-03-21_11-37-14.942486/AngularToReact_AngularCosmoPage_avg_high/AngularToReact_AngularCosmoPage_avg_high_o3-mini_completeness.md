# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
  The code implements asynchronous actions for fetching, saving (including duplicate functionality), and deleting pages via Redux Toolkit. It clearly covers all aspects of page management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
  A select element is provided in the PageForm component, with logic to set and update the page type using the state and reducers.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
  In the handleTitleChange callback, if the current URL is empty or if creating a new page, an auto-generated URL is produced from the title text.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
  The code includes an input for tags, fetching of tag suggestions from the API, and a clickable suggestion mechanism to replace or append tags accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
  The form provides radio buttons for the publish status, allowing the user to choose between publish, draft, and schedule, which is clearly reflected in the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
  When the publish status is set to "schedule", the component shows a datetime-local input for scheduling. The code handles conversion of the schedule date into the proper format for backend processing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
  The code checks localStorage for newer versions of page fields and provides options for discarding or using the local version, demonstrating proper local storage version management.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
  The integration with react-toastify is evident, with toasts displayed for success and error messages throughout the save, delete, and other operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
  The handleSave function checks for missing page type or invalid URL before proceeding, and appropriate error notifications are triggered.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
  The services file comprehensively covers the APIs for content retrieval, creation, updating, deletion, tag management, revisions, and extras. Each endpoint is correctly utilized in the async functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
  The code includes reducers and API calls (createContentExtra and createContentRevisionsExtra) that handle additional "extras" data, ensuring extras management is maintained.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
  A revision is created whenever the page is saved, and related extras are also stored via appropriate API calls, preserving revision history.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
  The project structure divides concerns into distinct folders (features, services, types, app) which keeps business logic separate from UI components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
  The integration with react-i18next is intact, with the use of the t function in various parts of the UI to support internationalization.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
  The code handles URL fetching, navigation, and dynamic routing via react-router-dom, ensuring that the URL structure is respected and maintained.
