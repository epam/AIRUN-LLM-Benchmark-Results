# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling
  
  The component clearly uses Angular's Reactive Forms as evidenced by the FormBuilder import, form group creation, and formControlName directives in the HTML template.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)
  
  The form control for name includes validators for required, minLength(3), and maxLength(60). The email has required and custom email format validation. The password validation includes a required validator and a custom validator that checks for minimum length of 6 characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use
  
  The code correctly implements asynchronous validators for both name and email that make API calls (via the validateName and validateEmail functions) to check if they are already in use.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched
  
  The HTML template includes appropriate CSS classes `has-error` and `has-success` that are conditionally applied based on the validation state and whether the field has been touched.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions
  
  The onSubmit method correctly dispatches the signup action with the form values when the form is valid and not already submitting. However, I cannot see the actual API service implementation, only the call to it in the effects file.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails
  
  The HTML template includes appropriate error messages using `*ngIf` directives that display specific messages based on different validation errors (required, minlength, maxlength, nameInUse, invalidEmail, emailInUse).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service
  
  The title is set correctly in the ngOnInit method using the Title service and a helper function getTitle.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management
  
  The component imports and uses Store from @ngrx/store and Actions from @ngrx/effects, and dispatches actions to handle the signup process.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress
  
  The submit button has the `[disabled]="isSubmitting || form.invalid"` attribute, which correctly disables it during submission or when the form is invalid.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses
  
  The effects file shows handling of both success and error responses from the API call, but we don't see the actual API implementation to fully verify.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management
  
  The component properly implements OnInit and OnDestroy interfaces, correctly manages subscriptions, and follows best practices for component structure.

- **Fail** (80%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises
  
  While the API calls are clearly using observables (as seen in the effects and validators), the actual API implementation is not visible in the provided code. However, based on the usage pattern and imports, it seems like the API might be using HttpClient but we cannot confirm this with 100% certainty.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements
  
  All required validation error messages are properly displayed in the HTML template, including messages for required fields, minimum/maximum length requirements, and already-in-use validations.
