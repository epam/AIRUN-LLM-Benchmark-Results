# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The component imports FormBuilder and creates a FormGroup using fb.group in the constructor, which confirms the use of Angular’s Reactive Forms.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The "name" field includes Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3), and Validators.maxLength(60); the "email" field includes Validators.required along with a synchronous validation through validateEmail (which checks for a valid email format via the validator library); and the "password" field includes Validators.required and validatePassword that enforces a minimum length of 6.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  The "name" and "email" form controls include asynchronous validators (validateName and the asynchronous part of validateEmail respectively) that check against the API (via api.isName and api.isEmail) to determine if the provided values are already in use.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  In the HTML template, the form groups apply dynamic CSS classes ([class.has-error] and [class.has-success]) based on the touched state and validity of the controls, ensuring proper feedback.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  The onSubmit() method dispatches authActions.signup with the required form data, which is then processed by the auth.effects to execute the API call and handle further actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The HTML template contains conditional span elements that display error messages (e.g., "Name is required", "Name must be at least 3 characters", etc.) when validation errors occur.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  In ngOnInit, the titleService.setTitle(getTitle('Signup')) is used, which correctly sets the page title.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The component injects the Store from @ngrx/store and dispatches authActions, and the separate auth.effects file shows the use of @ngrx/effects to manage side effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button in the HTML template uses the [disabled]="isSubmitting || form.invalid" binding, ensuring it is disabled during submission.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  The auth.effects.ts file makes an API call and maps the response to either authActions.signupComplete (on success) or authActions.signupFailure (on error), indicating robust handling of both outcomes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component implements OnInit and OnDestroy, and it unsubscribes from subscriptions, following recommended Angular practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  Although the implementation details of the API module are abstracted, the code consistently uses RxJS observables (via pipe, map, catchError) to handle API responses, which is in line with the usage of Angular’s HttpClient rather than direct promises.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The HTML template includes error messages for each form control that correspond to the requirements (e.g., for required fields, minimum length, invalid email format, and uniqueness checks), ensuring the appropriate messages are displayed.
