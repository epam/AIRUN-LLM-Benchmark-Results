# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The code clearly indicates the use of Angular framework through imports from '@angular' packages, component decorators, and Angular-specific concepts like NgModules. Although the specific version isn't explicitly stated in the code, the solution mentions "Angular 14" in the introduction.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
  
  The code includes imports from '@ngrx/store', creates a store with reducers, and components interact with the store using the Store service.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
  
  The code includes '@ngrx/effects' imports, defines a TodoEffects class with effects for loading todos, adding todos, and saving todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
  
  The code includes well-defined actions (loadTodos, addTodo, toggleTodo, etc.), a reducer function that handles these actions, and selectors to extract data from the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
  
  All components use the @Component decorator, and child components use @Input for receiving data and @Output with EventEmitter for sending events to parent components.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators
  
  While the code mentions replacing React refs, it doesn't actually implement @ViewChild for the edit input element in the TodoItemComponent where auto-focusing would be needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
  
  Components like TodoFooterComponent and TodoInputComponent receive data through @Input properties and emit events using @Output EventEmitters.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
  
  The TodoService is provided at the root level and handles interactions with localStorage for todo data persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
  
  Services and Store are injected through constructors in components and effects, following Angular's dependency injection pattern.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
  
  ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush is applied to TodoItemComponent and TodoFooterComponent for performance optimization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
  
  The code includes AppRoutingModule and TodoRoutingModule with defined routes, and TodoFooterComponent includes links that update the route based on the selected filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code follows Angular naming conventions for files and components, organizes code into feature modules, and uses barrel files for exports.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
  
  TypeScript interfaces (ITodo, TodoFilter) are defined and used consistently throughout the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
  
  React JSX has been converted to Angular HTML templates with appropriate Angular-specific syntax (ngFor, ngIf, etc.).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
  
  React event handlers like onClick are replaced with Angular event bindings like (click).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs
  
  The code does not contain any "TODO" comments or placeholders for incomplete functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules
  
  The app-routing.module.ts uses lazy loading for the TodoModule with the loadChildren syntax.
