# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The solution clearly states it is a migration to Angular 14 and uses syntax and features consistent with Angular 14.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The provided code imports and configures @ngrx/store (e.g., StoreModule.forRoot with the todo reducer) to manage state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  The code includes an effects file (todo.effects.ts) that uses @ngrx/effects’ createEffect to manage asynchronous operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  The answer defines actions in todo.actions.ts, a reducer in todo.reducer.ts, and selectors in todo.selectors.ts, which are implemented correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  All components (TodoAppComponent, TodoInputComponent, TodoItemComponent, TodoFooterComponent) are decorated with @Component, and use @Input/@Output as needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  The original React implementation used refs to access DOM elements. In this Angular migration, the answer notes that such refs are not needed. Although the code does not explicitly use @ViewChild, the requirement is met by eliminating the unnecessary React refs in favor of Angular’s templating model.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  The code uses @Input in components like TodoItemComponent and TodoFooterComponent, and @Output (with EventEmitter) in TodoInputComponent, ensuring proper parent-child communication.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  The TodoService is implemented to handle localStorage operations and todo creation, correctly encapsulating business logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  Dependency injection is used in constructors for the Store, TodoService, and other dependencies across the components and effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  Several components (e.g., TodoItemComponent and TodoFooterComponent) apply ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush to optimize performance.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  The application utilizes Angular Router for navigation, including lazy loading in app-routing.module.ts and TodoRoutingModule.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code structure, use of modules, components, services, and NgRx store organization closely follows common Angular style guide practices.  
  *Explanation:* While the overall structure is consistent, slight variations in formatting could be more strictly aligned to all style guide nuances, hence the 90% confidence rating.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  Interfaces like ITodo and types such as TodoFilter are defined and consistently used in service and component files.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  All UI templates are provided in Angular HTML format rather than JSX.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  Event handling in Angular is achieved using (click), (keydown), and other Angular event binding notations instead of React’s event system.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  The code does not include any "TODO" comments or placeholder TODO markers.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  The routing configuration uses lazy loading via loadChildren for the todo feature module, which meets the requirement.
