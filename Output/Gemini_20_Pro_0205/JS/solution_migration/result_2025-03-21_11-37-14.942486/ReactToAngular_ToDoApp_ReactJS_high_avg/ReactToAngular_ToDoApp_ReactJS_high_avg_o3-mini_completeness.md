# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The application displays the todo items through the TodoAppComponent, which uses the selectVisibleTodos selector to render the list via *ngFor in the template.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoInputComponent captures the Enter key event and emits the title. The TodoAppComponent’s onAddTodo method dispatches the addTodo action, which is then handled by the effect to add a new todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  In TodoItemComponent, the toggle method dispatches the toggleTodo action on checkbox change, which updates the state appropriately in the reducer.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent provides edit, save, and cancel methods for editing a todo item. The component manages an editing flag and uses an input bound to editText to update the title when the Enter key is pressed or when the input loses focus.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  The destroy method in TodoItemComponent dispatches the deleteTodo action, which removes the todo from the state as handled by the reducer.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  TodoAppComponent’s toggleAll method dispatches the toggleAllTodos action. The template includes a checkbox which, upon change, triggers this method to mark all todos as complete/incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  Filtering is implemented in the NgRx selectors—selectVisibleTodos applies the filtering logic based on the filter state. The footer component dispatches setVisibilityFilter actions when clicking the corresponding filter button.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The application uses an observable activeCount$ (provided via the selectActiveCount selector) and displays it inside the TodoFooterComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The TodoFooterComponent emits an event on clicking the Clear Completed button, which dispatches clearCompletedTodos, and the reducer filters out completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  The TodoService provides both getTodos and saveTodos methods for retrieving and persisting todos. The effect saveTodos$ uses a tap operator to persist the state changes to localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The routing is set up to support both a default redirect ('' to '/all') and a parameterized route (':filter'), preserving URL structure for navigation similar to the original React application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  The template of TodoAppComponent uses an *ngIf directive to conditionally show the main section only when there are visible todos, ensuring proper handling of the empty state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  The TodoInputComponent listens for the Enter key and, upon a valid trimmed input, emits an event to add the todo. This confirms that form submission is correctly managed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The application’s modular design divides the functionality into core, store, and feature modules with clearly defined component hierarchies (TodoAppComponent, TodoItemComponent, TodoFooterComponent, and TodoInputComponent), preserving organized component relationships.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  The migration retains the core functionalities (adding, editing, toggling, deleting, filtering, and persisting todos) present in the original React code, while leveraging NgRx for state management and Angular’s component structure.
