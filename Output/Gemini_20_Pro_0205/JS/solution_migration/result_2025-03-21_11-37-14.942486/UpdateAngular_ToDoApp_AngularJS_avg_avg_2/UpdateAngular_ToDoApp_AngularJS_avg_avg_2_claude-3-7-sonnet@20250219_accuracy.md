# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The code is clearly using Angular framework as evidenced by imports from '@angular/core' and the usage of Angular decorators like @Component, @Injectable, etc. While the exact version is not explicitly stated, the code structure and imports are consistent with Angular 14.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS
  
  The application consistently uses ES modules with import/export statements throughout all files, which is the modern approach. There is no sign of RequireJS usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management
  
  The application properly implements @ngrx/store as evidenced by imports from '@ngrx/store', use of Store in components, and the definition of actions, reducers, and selectors in dedicated files.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects
  
  The application correctly implements @ngrx/effects through the TodoEffects class in todo.effects.ts, with properly defined effects for handling asynchronous operations and side effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management
  
  The application has well-defined actions (in todo.actions.ts), reducers (in todo.reducer.ts), selectors (in todo.selectors.ts), and effects (in todo.effects.ts), covering all necessary operations for todo management including loading, adding, toggling, updating, removing, clearing completed, and marking all todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator
  
  The TodoService is properly decorated with @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }), making it injectable throughout the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service
  
  The TodoService appropriately uses localStorage for data persistence with methods to get, persist, and modify todos, using 'todos-angular' as the storage key.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators
  
  All components (AppComponent, HeaderComponent, MainComponent, TodoListComponent, TodoItemComponent, FooterComponent) use the proper @Component decorator with selector, template, and styles properties.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators
  
  Both TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective use the proper @Directive decorator with selector properties.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)
  
  The component templates properly use Angular template syntax, including *ngFor in TodoListComponent, *ngIf in MainComponent and FooterComponent, and other Angular template features.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))
  
  Event binding is implemented correctly with Angular syntax throughout the application, such as (click), (change), (submit), (blur), etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])
  
  Property binding is implemented correctly using Angular syntax, such as [class.completed], [checked], [routerLink], etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed
  
  Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed, including ngOnInit in MainComponent, ngOnChanges in TodoListComponent and TodoFocusDirective, and ngOnDestroy in TodoEscapeDirective.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models
  
  The Todo interface is properly defined in models/todo.model.ts with appropriate properties (id, title, completed).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services
  
  Dependency injection is properly implemented in all components and services, with dependencies declared in constructors (e.g., Store, Router, ActivatedRoute, TodoService).

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code generally follows Angular style guide conventions with appropriate naming, organization, and structure. There might be minor deviations,
