# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The explanation explicitly states that the refactored TodoMVC application is built with Angular 14 and NgRx.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
  The code uses standard ES modules with import/export syntax throughout, eliminating RequireJS.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
  The application imports and sets up StoreModule from @ngrx/store in the AppModule, with a clearly defined reducer.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
  The code includes an EffectsModule in the AppModule and defines side effects using createEffect in the TodoEffects class.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
  Detailed files for actions (todo.actions.ts), reducer (todo.reducer.ts), selectors (todo.selectors.ts), and effects (todo.effects.ts) are provided and properly structured.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
  The TodoService and TodoEffects are decorated with @Injectable, ensuring they are available for dependency injection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
  The TodoService implements methods that interact with localStorage (e.g., getTodos and persistTodos).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
  All components (AppComponent, HeaderComponent, MainComponent, TodoListComponent, TodoItemComponent, FooterComponent) employ the @Component decorator.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
  Both TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective correctly use the @Directive decorator.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
  The templates include directives such as *ngFor and *ngIf as well as the async pipe for Observables.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
  Event bindings like (click) and (submit) are used consistently throughout the components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
  Property bindings such as [class.completed] are properly employed in the component templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
  Lifecycle hooks, including ngOnInit and ngOnChanges, are implemented in components and directives as appropriate.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
  A TypeScript interface for Todo is defined in todo.model.ts, ensuring proper type definitions for the model.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
  Components and services inject dependencies (like Store, ActivatedRoute, and TodoService) via their constructors as per Angular standards.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The structure, naming, and separation of concerns in the code align well with common Angular style guide practices.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
  No obvious console error–prone patterns or deprecated usages are apparent in the code. However, without executing the code it's hard to be absolutely certain, so confidence is slightly less than 100%.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
  The application makes use of TypeScript’s type system, including interfaces and type annotations across components, actions, and services.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
  The provided code is clean with no leftover TODOs or commented-out lines.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows the single responsibility principle in component design  
  Each component, service, and directive has a well-defined responsibility, demonstrating adherence to the single responsibility principle.
