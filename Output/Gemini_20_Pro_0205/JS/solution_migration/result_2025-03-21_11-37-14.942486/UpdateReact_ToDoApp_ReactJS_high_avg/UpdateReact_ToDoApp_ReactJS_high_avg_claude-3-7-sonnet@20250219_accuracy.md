# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all React imports use React 18.x compatible syntax
  
  The imports are using the React 18 compatible syntax. For example, the entry point uses `createRoot` from 'react-dom/client' instead of the older `render` method:
  ```tsx
  import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all components use functional component syntax with hooks instead of class components
  
  All components are implemented as functional components using hooks like useState, useEffect, useCallback, and useRef instead of class components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Redux Toolkit's createSlice is used for state management
  
  Redux Toolkit is properly used with createSlice in the todoSlice.ts file:
  ```typescript
  const todoSlice = createSlice({
    name: 'todos',
    initialState,
    reducers: {
      // reducers defined here
    }
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for all props, state, and Redux store
  
  TypeScript interfaces are defined appropriately, including:
  ```typescript
  export interface Todo {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    completed: boolean;
  }

  interface TodoState {
    todos: Todo[];
    nowShowing: string;
  }

  interface TodoItemProps {
    id: string;
  }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses immutable state updates in reducers
  
  Redux Toolkit's createSlice uses Immer under the hood, allowing for "mutative" code that actually produces immutable updates:
  ```typescript
  toggleTodo: (state, action: PayloadAction<string>) => {
    const todo = state.todos.find((todo) => todo.id === action.payload);
    if (todo) {
      todo.completed = !todo.completed;
      localStorage.setItem('react-todos', JSON.stringify(state.todos));
    }
  }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that nanoid is used for ID generation instead of custom UUID implementation
  
  The application properly imports and uses nanoid for generating unique IDs:
  ```typescript
  import { nanoid } from 'nanoid';
  
  // In the prepare function
  prepare: (title: string) => ({
    payload: {
      id: nanoid(),
      title,
    },
  }),
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application uses React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate
  
  React.memo is used for the TodoItem component to prevent unnecessary re-renders:
  ```tsx
  export const TodoItem: React.FC<TodoItemProps> = React.memo(({ id }) => {
    // Component implementation
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that useCallback is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  
  useCallback is consistently used for event handlers throughout the application:
  ```tsx
  const handleToggle = useCallback(() => {
    if (todo) {
      dispatch(toggleTodo(todo.id));
    }
  }, [dispatch, todo]);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage handling is implemented in a modern way
  
  LocalStorage is handled directly with modern syntax:
  ```typescript
  // Load initial state
  const loadInitialState = (): Todo[] => {
    const storedTodos = localStorage.getItem('react-todos');
    return storedTodos ? JSON.parse(storedTodos) : [];
  };
  
  // Save state
  localStorage.setItem('react-todos', JSON.stringify(state.todos));
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows consistent naming conventions throughout the application
  
  The code follows consistent naming conventions with camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for components and interfaces, and lowercase with hyphens for CSS classes.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that proper error handling is implemented where necessary
  
  Basic error handling is present but could be more comprehensive:
  ```typescript
  if (!todo) {
    return null; // Or some placeholder/error handling
