# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed
  
  The code in the `Header.tsx` component clearly shows the implementation of this functionality in the `handleNewTodoKeyDown` function, which checks for the Enter key and dispatches the `addTodo` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter
  
  The `TodoList.tsx` component uses the `filteredTodosSelector` from the Redux store to display todos according to the current filter. The selector logic is well-implemented in `todoSlice.ts` to filter based on the `nowShowing` state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos
  
  The `MainSection.tsx` component includes an input checkbox with an `onChange` handler that dispatches the `toggleAllTodos` action, which is properly implemented in the Redux slice to toggle all todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted
  
  The `TodoItem.tsx` component includes functions for toggling (`handleToggle`), editing (`handleEdit`, `handleSubmit`), and deleting (`handleDestroy`) individual todos, with corresponding Redux actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode
  
  In the `TodoItem.tsx` component, the label has an `onDoubleClick` handler (`handleEdit`) that sets the component to editing mode by updating the local state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo
  
  The `handleKeyDown` function in `TodoItem.tsx` checks for the Enter key and calls `handleSubmit` to update the todo in the Redux store.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value
  
  The `handleKeyDown` function in `TodoItem.tsx` also checks for the Escape key, and when pressed, it exits editing mode and restores the original todo title.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The `Footer.tsx` component calculates and displays the count of active todos, with proper pluralization logic for the word "item".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The `Footer.tsx` component includes filter links for All, Active, and Completed todos, with proper CSS class application based on the current filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos
  
  The `Footer.tsx` component includes a "Clear completed" button that dispatches the `clearCompletedTodos` action when clicked, and it's only shown when there are completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence
  
  The `todoSlice.ts` file includes code to load initial todos from localStorage and updates localStorage after every state change in the reducers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state
  
  Various components (MainSection, Footer, TodoItem) include conditional rendering logic based on the state of todos, such as hiding the footer when there are no todos, or conditionally rendering the "Clear completed" button.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count
  
  The `Footer.tsx` component includes logic to pluralize the word "item" based on the count of active todos: `const itemCount = activeCount === 1 ? 'item' : 'items';`

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components
  
  The application is properly decomposed into smaller, focused components: App, Header, MainSection, TodoList, TodoItem, and Footer, each with a single responsibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality
  
  The code follows a logical organization with separate folders for components and store, and constants are separated into their own file, which is good practice for maintainability.
