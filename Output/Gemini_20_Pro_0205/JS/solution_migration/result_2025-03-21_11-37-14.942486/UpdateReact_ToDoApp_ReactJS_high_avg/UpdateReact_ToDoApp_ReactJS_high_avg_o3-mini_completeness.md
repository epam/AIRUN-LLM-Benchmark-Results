# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The Header component defines an input with an onKeyDown handler that checks for the 'Enter' key, dispatches the addTodo action, and clears the input afterward.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The TodoList component uses the filteredTodosSelector, which filters todos based on the current nowShowing value from Redux state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  The MainSection component includes a checkbox that calls the toggleAllTodos action with the checked state, effectively toggling all todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  The TodoItem component provides functionality for toggling (via a checkbox), editing (via double-click and subsequent input handling), and deletion (via a destroy button).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  In the TodoItem component, a double-click on the label triggers handleEdit, which sets the editing state to true.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  The TodoItem component’s input field listens for the 'Enter' key in the onKeyDown handler, triggering handleSubmit to update the todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  The onKeyDown handler in TodoItem checks for the 'Escape' key and, if detected, disables editing and resets the editText to the original todo title.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  The Footer component fetches activeCount from the state and displays it alongside appropriate text.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The Footer component renders filter links for All, Active, and Completed, and uses conditional styling to indicate the selected filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  The Footer component conditionally renders a “Clear completed” button when completed todos are present, which dispatches clearCompletedTodos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  The todoSlice reducers update localStorage whenever there is a change in the todos state, and the initial state is loaded from localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  Both MainSection and Footer components conditionally render their content (or return null) based on the count of todos and their state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  The Footer component correctly chooses between “item” and “items” based on whether activeCount is 1 or not.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The code is structured into distinct components such as Header, MainSection, TodoList, TodoItem, and Footer, each handling specific functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The project follows a clear structure with components in the /src/components folder, store logic in /src/store, and related utilities such as constants in separate files.
