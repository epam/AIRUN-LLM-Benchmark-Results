# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration
  
  The code shows proper use of Create React App with TypeScript template through the command `npx create-react-app virtual-piano-react --template typescript`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure

  The code defines and uses a proper TypeScript interface for audio mapping:
  ```typescript
  interface SoundMapper {
    [key: string]: HTMLAudioElement;
  }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks

  All components (App, PianoKey, FullscreenButton) are implemented as functional components using the React.FC type and leverage hooks like useState, useEffect, and useCallback.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)

  The application uses appropriate state management:
  - `useState` for activeNotes, showLetters, isMouseDown, and isFullscreen
  - `useEffect` for managing event listeners and cleanup
  - `useCallback` for memoizing event handlers

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels

  Keyboard event handlers are implemented at the App component level using useCallback and attached with useEffect, handling both keydown and keyup events.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events

  All mouse interactions are implemented using React synthetic events in the PianoKey component:
  - onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseLeave, and onMouseEnter handlers
  - Additional global mouseup handler in the App component

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment

  Audio resources are handled correctly with:
  - A SoundMapper object with proper typing
  - Playback with .play() and error handling
  - currentTime reset for repeated key presses

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility

  Fullscreen functionality is properly encapsulated in the FullscreenButton component:
  - Uses document.fullscreenElement to detect fullscreen state
  - Implements proper requestFullscreen/exitFullscreen with error handling
  - Listens for fullscreenchange events to update UI state

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns

  Conditional classes are implemented using template literals and conditional expressions:
  ```jsx
  className={`piano ${showLetters ? 'letters' : ''}`}
  className={`btn btn-notes ${!showLetters ? 'btn-active' : ''}`}
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate

  The PianoKey component is wrapped with React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders, and event handlers use useCallback to maintain referential equality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations

  Audio playback is handled with proper lifecycle considerations:
  - Sound objects are created once during component initialization
  - Play/stop functionality is memoized with useCallback
  - Error handling for audio playback is implemented

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application

  TypeScript is consistently used throughout the application:
  - Interface definitions for props and data structures
  - Type annotations for functions, state, and component props
  - Event types for event handlers (e.g., MouseEvent, KeyboardEvent)
