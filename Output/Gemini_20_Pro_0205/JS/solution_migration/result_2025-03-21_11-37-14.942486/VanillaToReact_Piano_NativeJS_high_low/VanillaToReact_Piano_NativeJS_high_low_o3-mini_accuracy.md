# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (95%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration  
  The answer demonstrates the use of Create React App with the TypeScript template (via the command “npx create-react-app virtual-piano-react --template typescript”). Although the React version isn’t explicitly stated, modern Create React App defaults to React 18, so this step is assumed to pass with a high degree of confidence.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure  
  The code defines an interface named SoundMapper for mapping strings to HTMLAudioElement objects, which confirms the use of proper TypeScript interfaces.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks  
  All provided components (App, PianoKey, FullscreenButton) are written as functional components and make extensive use of React hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useCallback.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)  
  The implementation employs useState to manage active notes, display toggling, and mouse state, along with useEffect to manage event listeners and lifecycle cleanup.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels  
  Global keyboard event listeners (keydown and keyup) are set up within the App component using useEffect, ensuring that keyboard interactions are handled appropriately for the piano functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events  
  Mouse events are handled using React’s synthetic events (onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseLeave, and onMouseEnter) within the PianoKey component, enabling correct behavior during mouse interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment  
  The soundMapper object is used to create and store HTMLAudioElement instances. The playNote function resets the currentTime and catches any playback errors, indicating proper handling of audio resources.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility  
  The FullscreenButton component implements fullscreen toggling using document.fullscreenElement, requestFullscreen, and exitFullscreen. It also includes a catch block for error handling and an event listener for fullscreen changes, aligning with React patterns and handling compatibility concerns.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns  
  Conditional classes are applied using template literals (for example, in the piano div and buttons) based on state, demonstrating the correct use of React patterns for conditional styling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate  
  The PianoKey component is wrapped in React.memo, which prevents unnecessary re-renders when props do not change, reflecting a performance optimization.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations  
  The management of audio playback occurs in response to state and event management in the App component, with appropriate useEffect hooks ensuring that event listeners are added and removed correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application  
  Throughout the code, interfaces and proper type annotations are applied (e.g., SoundMapper, PianoKeyProps, and functional component types), evidencing a strict adherence to TypeScript’s typing system.
