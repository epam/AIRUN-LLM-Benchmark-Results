# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'  
  The code includes a header section with `<h1 className="header-title">Virtual Piano</h1>`, ensuring that the title is rendered correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons  
  The application contains a `<div className="btn-container">` with two buttons labeled "Notes" and "Letters" that toggle display mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)  
  The code iterates over the `keys` and `sharpKeys` arrays to render natural keys (via the `PianoKey` component) and sharp keys (with a placeholder for `'fâ™¯'` to reflect the intended layout).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes  
  Each `PianoKey` renders a `<div>` with `data-letter` and `data-note` attributes attached, ensuring the keys are properly annotated for identification.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked  
  The `playNote` function utilizes a sound mapping object (`soundMapper`) to play the correct audio for the given note upon user interaction, including handling of errors via a `.catch()`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)  
  By conditionally adding the `piano-key-active` class when a key is active (via the state `activeNotes`), the application provides visual feedback for pressed keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes  
  Global keyboard event listeners (`keydown` and `keyup`) are attached that correctly match key presses with their corresponding piano notes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked  
  The state `showLetters` toggles the CSS class applied to the piano container, ensuring that the interface displays either notes or letters based on the button clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes  
  The `FullscreenButton` component implements fullscreen toggling via the Fullscreen API with proper event handling and error management.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly  
  The `activeNotes` state array is designed to track and manage multiple keys being pressed simultaneously, and the event handlers add and remove notes appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys  
  The implementation uses an `isMouseDown` state along with mouse event handlers (including `onMouseEnter` in `PianoKey`) to correctly handle dragging the mouse over keys while pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information  
  The application renders a `<footer>` with a container showing the text "2020", fulfilling the requirement for footer information.
