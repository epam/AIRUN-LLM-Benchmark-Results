# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos  
  The code implements a header in App.tsx containing an h1 element with the title “todos” and includes the TodoInput component, which provides an input field for new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos  
  The TodoList component defines a section with id "main" that conditionally displays based on the todo list length and contains a toggle-all checkbox as well as a list (ul) of todos rendered using the TodoItem component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button  
  In the TodoItem component, each todo is rendered with an input of type "checkbox" to toggle completion, a label displaying the title, and a button with class "destroy" to delete the todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode  
  The TodoItem component uses onDoubleClick on the label to trigger handleEdit, which sets editing state to true and renders an input field for editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  Filtering is implemented using Redux state for the filter. The Footer component provides Links to "/all", "/active", and "/completed", and the filtering logic is applied via selectors in todosSelectors.ts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization  
  The Footer component displays the active remaining count (using selectActiveTodoCount) and uses a pluralize helper function to adjust for singular or plural wording.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter  
  The Footer component conditionally applies the "selected" class to the Link corresponding to the current filter from Redux state, ensuring the active filter is visually highlighted.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist  
  In Footer, the button with the class "clear-completed" is only rendered when completedCount is greater than 0, enabling the user to clear completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter  
  The TodoInput component monitors the keyboard event and dispatches an addTodo action when Enter is pressed with a non-empty trimmed value.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos  
  The TodoItem includes an input checkbox that, on change, dispatches the toggleTodo action to switch the completion state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once  
  The TodoList component contains a toggle-all checkbox that dispatches toggleAllTodos, allowing all todos to be switched simultaneously.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management  
  In TodoItem, when editing mode is triggered (via double-click), an input field is rendered and focus is managed using useRef and useEffect, ensuring the cursor is placed at the end of the text.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos  
  The TodoItem component provides a delete button (with the class "destroy") that dispatches a deleteTodo action when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos  
  The Footer provides a 'Clear completed' button that dispatches clearCompletedTodos, effectively removing all todos that are marked completed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status  
  The selectors in todosSelectors.ts (especially selectFilteredTodos) ensure that the list of todos is correctly filtered according to the active filter ("all", "active", "completed").
