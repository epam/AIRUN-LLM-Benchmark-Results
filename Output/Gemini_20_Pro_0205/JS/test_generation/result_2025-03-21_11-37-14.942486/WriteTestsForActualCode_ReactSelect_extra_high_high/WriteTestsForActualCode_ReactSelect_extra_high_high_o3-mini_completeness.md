# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist  
  The test suite includes multiple tests under the "Rendering" section (e.g., renders with default props, renders with custom placeholder) that confirm the component renders correctly with its default properties.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present  
  Multiple tests exist for keyboard interactions: tests for arrow key navigation, selecting options with Enter and Tab, and closing the menu with the Escape key are present.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)  
  Although there are several tests involving clicking (e.g., opening the menu, selecting an option, clicking the clear indicator), no tests specifically simulate or verify hovering behavior.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior  
  The suite has a dedicated test ("behaves as a controlled component") showing controlled behavior. While uncontrolled behavior isn’t explicitly labeled, rendering without a value implicitly exercises it. The slight deduction is due to the absence of a dedicated uncontrolled behavior test.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values  
  The tests for selecting an option, clearing values (via the clear indicator), and removing values in multi-select mode adequately assess state changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented  
  The tests cover opening the menu by clicking and arrow key presses as well as closing it using the Escape key and tab navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality  
  There is a test ("filters options based on input") that verifies the filtering of options based on user input.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist  
  Multiple tests confirm multi-select functionality, such as removing a value in multi-select mode and verifying the rendering of hidden inputs for multi-select values.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility  
  The suite tests ARIA attributes (e.g., aria-label, aria-labelledby, aria-activedescendant) and includes an accessibility test for updating the aria-live region.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested  
  An edge case test exists for rendering with an empty options array, as well as tests for scenarios with no matching options.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states  
  The suite includes tests for a loading state (renders loading message when isLoading is true) and for the “no options” message, which covers the error/no-result scenarios.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states  
  There are clear tests for rendering the component as disabled and for ensuring a disabled option is not selectable.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance  
  The test suite does not include any specific tests involving large option sets to assess performance under heavy data conditions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested  
  Tests for focus management (e.g., blurring the input after selection, verifying focused option via arrow keys) demonstrate proper handling of focus during interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering  
  There are explicit tests checking both default and custom placeholder rendering, as well as the rendering of a selected value.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations  
  A dedicated test confirms that a custom formatOptionLabel function is called and that the formatted label appears in the document.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)  
  The suite includes tests verifying that onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, and onMenuClose are invoked with the expected parameters.

- **Pass** (95%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)  
  The tests cover the clear indicator (via clicking the clear button) and the loading indicator (by displaying a loading message). However, there is no specific test for the dropdown indicator. This small gap gives a slightly lower confidence (95%).
