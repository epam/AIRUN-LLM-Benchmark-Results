# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources  
  All tests for the REST factory verify that every defined resource (blocks, blocksRequirements, comments, content, contentExtras, contentRevisions, contentRevisionsExtras, contentTags, files, filesTags, menus, modules, sitemaps, themes, settings, and users) is present and has its HTTP calls tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly  
  The tests for the Page factory check all default properties (id, title, description, header, subheader, body, url, type, published, published_date, themePages, timestamp, extras, and misc) ensuring that they are set to their default values.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly  
  The Users factory tests validate that all expected properties (id, username, name, bio, email, facebook, twitter, photo, and role) have correct default values and that setting/getting properties works as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods  
  The pageCtrl tests include checks for controller initialization, methods such as localVersion, deleteNewerVersion, deletePage, updatePageType, titleChange, descriptionChange, urlChange, saveLocal, autocompleteTags, selectSuggestion, savePage (both new page creation and update), and event handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller  
  Tests check for proper initialization of page properties and default values (including scheduleDate and themePages) during the controllerâ€™s set-up phase.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation  
  The tests for titleChange confirm that the URL is automatically generated from the title when the page is new, and that it does not overwrite an existing custom URL.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction  
  The saveLocal functionality is well-tested by verifying that all relevant page properties are correctly stored in localStorage, ensuring proper persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality  
  The autocompleteTags tests cover both successful suggestion retrieval, handling no results (HTTP 404), and clearing suggestions when no tag is being typed, as well as the selection of suggestions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)  
  Multiple tests check all aspects of the savePage functionality, including saving a new page, updating an existing page, handling duplicate page URLs (which trigger error states), and error responses from HTTP calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types  
  Specific tests ensure that errors are raised when a page is saved with no type selected or with an empty URL, thereby handling these edge cases properly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly  
  The deletion of a page is thoroughly tested by verifying that all associated resources (content, revisions, extras, tags) are correctly deleted and that the navigation redirects appropriately after deletion.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions  
  Tests for handling page versions (e.g., checking for unsaved changes, reverting to a local version, and deleting newer versions) correctly verify that localStorage is used for managing page versions.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components  
  Based on the comprehensive nature of tests for the REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and pageCtrl controller, the overall coverage is expected to be well above 80%.  
  (Confidence is 95% because exact coverage metrics are not provided, but the thorough test scenarios suggest a high coverage level.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling  
  The tests include a case for broadcasting the 'contentGet' event and verifying that page properties are updated accordingly, ensuring that event handling works as designed.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality  
  Tests confirm that the scheduleDate is correctly set (e.g., to the current date for new pages) and that date-related properties are handled properly during page initialization and saving.
