# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering  
  The "app.test.tsx" file contains tests such as "renders without crashing" which confirms the component is rendered correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos  
  The test "adds a new todo" in "app.test.tsx" verifies that new todos are added correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos  
  The "toggles all todos" test in "app.test.tsx" ensures that the toggle-all functionality works as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos  
  Multiple tests such as "renders active todos", "renders completed todos", and "renders all todos" validate the filtering functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The "clears completed todos" test in "app.test.tsx" confirms that the clearing operation is triggered correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering  
  The "renders correctly" test in "todoItem.test.tsx" confirms that the TodoItem component renders as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos  
  Tests such as "toggles todo on checkbox click", "destroys todo on button click", and "enters edit mode on double click" comprehensively cover these actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events  
  The tests "saves changes on Enter key", "cancels edit on Escape key" and "saves changes on blur" ensure keyboard events are handled appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts  
  The "renders correctly with active todos" and "renders correctly with completed todos" tests in "footer.test.tsx" address different counter scenarios.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation  
  The tests "shows 'All' filter as selected", "shows 'Active' filter as selected", and "shows 'Completed' filter as selected" confirm the proper navigation highlighting.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The test "calls onClearCompleted when button is clicked" in "footer.test.tsx" validates the clear-completed functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos  
  The "todoModel.test.ts" file includes tests for adding a new todo, toggling todos (both all and single), saving a todo, and destroying a todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions  
  The "subscribes and informs subscribers" test properly verifies the subscription and notification mechanism.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The "clears completed todos" test in "todoModel.test.ts" confirms that the method for clearing completed items works correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation  
  The tests "generates a valid UUID" and "generates unique UUIDs" in "utils.test.ts" adequately confirm the UUID functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality  
  The "pluralize" tests check both singular and plural returns, ensuring this utility function works as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations  
  The store functionality is tested through storing data, retrieving it, and returning an empty array when no data exists.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function  
  The "extend" function is validated with tests for merging objects, handling empty objects, and properly overwriting properties.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx  
  Most tests for React components follow the ".test.tsx" naming convention (e.g., app.test.tsx, todoItem.test.tsx, footer.test.tsx). Non-React tests use ".test.ts", which is common for utility code. Although there is a minor deviation regarding file extensions, this is acceptable in practice.  
  Explanation: The naming convention is slightly mixed (React components vs. utility functions), but it is acceptable and commonly used in TypeScript projects.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data  
  Throughout the tests (e.g., in "todoItem.test.tsx" and "todoModel.test.ts"), sample todo objects and arrays are provided as fixtures.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented  
  The solution includes a dedicated router mock ("__mocks__/routerMock.ts") and tests in "app.test.tsx" verifying that the router is initialized correctly.
