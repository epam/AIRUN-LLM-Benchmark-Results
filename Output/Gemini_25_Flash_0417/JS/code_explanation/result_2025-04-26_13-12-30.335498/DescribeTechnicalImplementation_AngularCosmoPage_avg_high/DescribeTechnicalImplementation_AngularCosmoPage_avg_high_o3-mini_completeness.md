- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all major components (REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and Page controller) are documented  
  The documentation explicitly mentions and explains the roles of the REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and Page controller in detail.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure all significant features of the page management system are described

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all form inputs and their behavior are documented  
  The documentation details the form fields (e.g., title, description, URL, publish status, schedule date, tags) and explains how they bind to the model and react to user actions.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify the documentation explains the page versioning and revision system  
  The documentation explains that on both creation and updates the component saves revisions using the REST calls, though the explanation could be enhanced with more explicit details on managing historical page versions.  
  (Slightly lower confidence due to minimal detail on version history management.)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation covers the tag system and autocomplete functionality
