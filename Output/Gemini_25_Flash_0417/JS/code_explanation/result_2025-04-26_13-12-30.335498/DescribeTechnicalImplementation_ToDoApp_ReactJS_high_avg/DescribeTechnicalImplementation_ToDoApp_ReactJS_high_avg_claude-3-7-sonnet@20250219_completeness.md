- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that best practices for implementation are noted in the documentation
  
  Best practices are noted throughout the documentation, particularly in sections 5 (Implementation Details) and 6 (Summary Information), mentioning practices like immutability, component separation, and performance optimization with `shouldComponentUpdate`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that typical usage patterns and configurations are demonstrated
  
  Section 3 (Usage Instructions) provides a detailed explanation of typical usage flow, including initialization, rendering, and various user interactions, with code examples and step-by-step descriptions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation explains how to integrate the components within a React application
  
  Section 3 explains integration with code examples showing how to initialize the TodoModel, render the TodoApp component, and subscribe to model changes, demonstrating the integration process.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation includes information about all key features and capabilities of each component
  
  The documentation thoroughly details the features and capabilities of each component in section 2 (Component Structure and Interface), covering props, state, and functionality for TodoApp, TodoItem, and TodoFooter.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation maintains a professional, technical writing style throughout
  
  The documentation consistently uses a professional and technical writing style with clear structure, appropriate terminology, and formal language throughout all sections.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation includes information about todo creation functionality
  
  Todo creation functionality is covered in section 3 under "User Interaction (e.g., Adding a Todo)" which describes the process flow when a user adds a new todo item.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation covers todo editing capabilities
  
  Todo editing capabilities are covered in section 2.2 (TodoItem Component) explaining the edit mode props and state, and in section 3 where the editing flow is described, as well as in section 5 discussing component lifecycle related to editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation explains todo completion toggling functionality
  
  Todo completion toggling is explained in section 3 under "User Interaction (e.g., Toggling a Todo)" which details the complete process flow when a user toggles a todo's completion status.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation describes filtering capabilities (All, Active, Completed)
  
  Filtering capabilities are described in multiple sections: in 2.1 and 2.3 regarding the `nowShowing` state property, and in section 3 under "User Interaction (e.g., Filtering)" which details the filtering process flow.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation covers the bulk actions (toggle all, clear completed)
  
  The documentation covers bulk actions: the "Mark all as complete" checkbox is mentioned in section 4 (Accessibility Features), and the "Clear completed" button is described in sections 2.3 (TodoFooter Component) and throughout other sections.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm that the documentation includes information about local storage persistence
  
  Local storage persistence is mentioned in sections 5 (Implementation Details) stating that the TodoModel manages "persistence (using `localStorage` via `Utils.store`)" and in section 3 mentioning loading data from localStorage during initialization. While covered, a dedicated subsection on persistence implementation details could have made this more comprehensive.
