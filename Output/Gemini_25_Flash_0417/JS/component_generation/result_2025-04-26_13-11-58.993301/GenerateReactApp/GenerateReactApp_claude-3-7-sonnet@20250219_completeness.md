# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
    
    The application fetches Star Wars characters from the SWAPI API (`https://swapi.dev/api/people/`) using Axios and displays them in an unordered list, with each character's name shown as a list item.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
    
    The application has a loading state that displays "Loading characters..." message while the API call is in progress. The loading state is properly managed with the `loading` state variable.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
    
    The application maps through all characters in the response data and displays them in the UI:
    ```jsx
    {characters.map((character) => (
      <li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>
    ))}
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
    
    The implementation doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields; it simply displays the fetched characters without any filtering or search options.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
    
    Each character is displayed as a list item showing the character's name:
    ```jsx
    <li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>
    ```

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
    
    The code indicates the application was created using Create React App with TypeScript template, as shown in the setup commands and the package.json structure. The only minor issue is that the index.tsx file has a typo with `import ReactDOM from 'client';` which should be `import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';` in a standard CRA setup.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
    
    The application properly manages three states:
    - `characters` state for storing fetched character data
    - `loading` state to track when data is being fetched
    - `error` state to track if an error occurred during API call

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
    
    Each list item has a unique key derived from the character's URL:
    ```jsx
    <li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>
    ```
    This is appropriate as the SWAPI API guarantees unique URLs for each resource.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
    
    The application handles the case when no characters are found:
    ```jsx
    {characters.length > 0 ? (
      <ul>
        {characters.map((character) => (
          <li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    ) : (
      <p>No characters found.</p>
    )}
    ```
