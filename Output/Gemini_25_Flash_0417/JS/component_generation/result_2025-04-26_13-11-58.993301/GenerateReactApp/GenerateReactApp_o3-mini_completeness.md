# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The application fetches data from "https://swapi.dev/api/people/" using Axios and maps through the returned characters to display them as a list. This meets the requirement that the list of characters is displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The code uses a "loading" state and, while true, renders "Loading characters..." to inform the user that data is being fetched.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  The component maps over the "characters" state array and renders a list item for each character, ensuring all fetched characters are displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  The provided code does not include any search input or other forms for user input, adhering to the specification.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each list item renders the "name" property of the character, ensuring that the character name is properly displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The instructions include using "npx create-react-app" with the TypeScript template, and the file structure (including package.json and src/App.tsx) adheres to the structure generated by Create React App.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The application utilizes React's useState hook for managing "characters", "loading", and "error" states, along with useEffect for data fetching, which meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  The characters are mapped with each <li> using "character.url" as a unique key, which is an appropriate and unique identifier.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  The code includes a conditional check to display "No characters found." if the fetched characters array is empty, properly handling an empty data state.
