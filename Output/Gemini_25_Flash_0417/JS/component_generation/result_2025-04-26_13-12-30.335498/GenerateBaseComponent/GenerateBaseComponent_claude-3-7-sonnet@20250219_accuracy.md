# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x
  
  The code uses modern React features compatible with React 18.x, including hooks like `useState`, `useRef`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`. The component is implemented as a functional component with the `React.FC` type.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
  
  The code properly uses TypeScript throughout. It includes a separate `types.ts` file defining the `Option` interface, and the component itself has well-defined props interface (`SearchableSelectProps`). Types are used consistently for state variables, refs, and function parameters.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling
  
  The answer includes a comprehensive CSS file with styles for all component states (default, hover, focus, highlighted, selected) and properly imports it in the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments
  
  The code is clean, well-structured, and has no TODO comments. All functions and variables have meaningful names, and the code includes appropriate comments explaining the purpose of different sections.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility
  
  The component uses appropriate React state hooks for managing:
  - Dropdown visibility (`isOpen`)
  - Search term (`searchTerm`) 
  - Highlighted index (`highlightedIndex`)
  - The selected value is properly managed via props

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props
  
  The component accepts several customizable props:
  - `options`: Array of selectable options
  - `value`: Currently selected value
  - `onSelect`: Callback for selection changes
  - `placeholder`: Customizable placeholder text
  - `label`: Optional accessibility label

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection
  
  The component has robust keyboard support:
  - Arrow keys for navigation through options
  - Enter/Space for selecting options
  - Escape for closing the dropdown
  - Character keys to focus the search input
  - Prevents default browser behavior where appropriate

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions
  
  The component uses refs correctly:
  - `rootRef` for outside click detection
  - `triggerRef` for focus management
  - `searchInputRef` for focusing the search input
  - `optionsListRef` for the dropdown
  - A Map of `optionRefs` for scrolling highlighted options into view

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques
  
  The component handles focus management well:
  - Automatically focuses the search input when the dropdown opens
  - Returns focus to the trigger button when the dropdown closes
  - Uses appropriate tabIndex attributes
  - Manages aria-activedescendant for keyboard navigation without moving focus

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
  
  The component implements ARIA correctly:
  - `role="combobox"` on the container
  - `aria-haspopup="listbox"` and `aria-expanded` on the container
  - `role="button"` on the trigger
  - `role="listbox"` on the dropdown
  - `role="option"` and `aria-selected` on each option
  - `aria-activedescendant` for indicating the highlighted option
  - `aria-label` for labeling elements
  - `aria-controls` for associating controls with their targets

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  The code doesn't contain any obvious sources of console errors or warnings. Dependencies in hooks are properly managed, and there are no missing keys in the rendered lists.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component
  
  The component optimizes for performance using:
  - `useMemo` for expensive calculations like filtering options
  - `useCallback` for event handlers to maintain referential stability
  - Dependencies arrays are properly specified in hooks
  - State updates are logical and don't cause infinite loops
