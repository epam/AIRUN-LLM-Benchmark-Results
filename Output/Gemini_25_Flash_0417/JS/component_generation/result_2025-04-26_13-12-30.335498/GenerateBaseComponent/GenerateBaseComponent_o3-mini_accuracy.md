# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  Although the code does not explicitly mention React 18.x, it uses modern React features (hooks, functional components) that are fully supported in React 18. There is slight uncertainty because the code does not specify React 18.x explicitly, but overall the implementation is consistent with React 18 practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  The code is written in TypeScript (.tsx files) and includes a separate file (types.ts) defining interfaces used throughout the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  The provided answer includes an index.css file that applies styling to the component elements.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  The implementation is clean, well-structured, and production-ready with no leftover TODO comments or placeholder code.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  The component properly manages state using useState for parameters like isOpen, searchTerm, and highlightedIndex, and works with a controlled prop for selected value.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  The component accepts props such as options, value, onSelect, placeholder, and label, enabling flexible reuse.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  The handleKeyDown callback supports arrow keys, Enter, Space, and Escape for navigation and selection, ensuring robust keyboard interaction.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  The implementation uses multiple refs (rootRef, triggerRef, searchInputRef, optionRefs) appropriately to manage DOM interactions and outside click detection.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  Focus is correctly managedâ€”for example, the search input is focused when the dropdown opens and focus is returned to the trigger when the dropdown closes.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  The component includes proper ARIA attributes (e.g., role="combobox", aria-expanded, aria-controls, role="listbox", aria-activedescendant) ensuring excellent accessibility.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  Based on the code review, there are no obvious errors or warnings. This evaluation is based solely on static analysis, so while everything appears correct, runtime behavior is not verified.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  With the strategic use of useMemo and useCallback to memoize computed values and event handlers, the component minimizes unnecessary re-renders. This conclusion is drawn from code inspection and best practices, so there is high but not absolute certainty.
