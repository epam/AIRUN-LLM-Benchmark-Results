# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component conditionally renders a list (`<ul>`) with role "listbox" when `isOpen` is true, fulfilling the dropdown UI element requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  The dropdown contains an `<input>` element placed as the first `<li>` in the list, which serves as the search input.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The component manages a single selected value via the `value` prop and updates selection using the `onSelect` callback when an option is clicked or selected via keyboard.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The event handler (`handleKeyDown`) properly manages `ArrowDown` and `ArrowUp` keys to update the `highlightedIndex` within the filtered options list.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  When an option is highlighted, pressing Enter triggers `handleOptionSelect` to select that option, as defined in the keyboard navigation logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  The component listens for Enter or Space key presses when it is closed, opening the dropdown accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  Both on Escape key press and after a selection (via mouse or keyboard), the code calls `triggerRef.current?.focus()`, ensuring focus returns to the select trigger element.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  The `onClick` event on each `<li>` for an option calls `handleOptionSelect`, which sets the dropdown's open state to false.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  Pressing Enter or Space (while an option is highlighted) invokes `handleOptionSelect`, resulting in the dropdown closing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  The `handleKeyDown` function checks for the Escape key and calls `setIsOpen(false)` to close the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  A `mousedown` event listener is attached to the document that detects clicks outside the component's root reference, closing the dropdown as required.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  When the componentâ€™s container is focused and the Enter key is pressed, the dropdown state is toggled open, allowing the component to display the options.
