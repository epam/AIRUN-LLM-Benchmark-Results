# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The application fetches character data from the SWAPI endpoint `https://swapi.dev/api/people/` using Axios and displays the results in an unordered list.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The application implements a loading state that displays "Loading characters..." while the API request is in progress:
  ```typescript
  if (loading) {
    return <div className="App">Loading characters...</div>;
  }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The application maps over the entire `characters` array to render each character:
  ```typescript
  {characters.map((character) => (
    <li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>
  ))}
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  The code doesn't implement any search functionality or user input fields. It only displays the list of characters fetched from the API.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character is displayed in a list item showing the character's name:
  ```typescript
  <li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The implementation clearly states that Create React App with TypeScript template is used:
  ```bash
  npx create-react-app swapi-character-list --template typescript
  ```
  Additionally, the structure of the files and the presence of typical CRA files like `reportWebVitals` confirm this.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The application implements three state variables for proper state management:
  ```typescript
  const [characters, setCharacters] = useState<Character[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<boolean>(false);
  ```
  These states are properly updated during the data fetching process.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each list item uses the character's URL as a unique key:
  ```typescript
  <li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>
  ```
  The code even includes a comment explaining that the URL is guaranteed to be unique per resource.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  The application includes conditional rendering for an empty character list:
  ```typescript
  {characters.length > 0 ? (
    <ul>
      {characters.map((character) => (
        <li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  ) : (
    <p>No characters found.</p>
  )}
  ```
  I'm 90% confident because while this handles the empty array case, it doesn't specifically handle cases where the API might return a successful response with an empty results array (though this is unlikely for the specific SWAPI endpoint).
