# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The application correctly fetches and maps the characters from SWAPI, displaying them in a list.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The code conditionally renders a loading message ("Loading characters...") during API fetching.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  All fetched character data (contained in the response's results) is rendered as list items in the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  The provided code does not implement any search functionality or input field; it only displays the fetched list.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each list item correctly displays the character's name from the API and uses the character's URL as a unique key.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The project setup, as described and shown in the package.json snippet, confirms the usage of Create React App with a TypeScript template.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  State management is handled appropriately with separate state variables for characters, loading, and error.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  Unique keys are provided by using the unique "url" attribute from each character, ensuring optimal list rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  The code includes logic to display a message ("No characters found.") if the character array is empty.
