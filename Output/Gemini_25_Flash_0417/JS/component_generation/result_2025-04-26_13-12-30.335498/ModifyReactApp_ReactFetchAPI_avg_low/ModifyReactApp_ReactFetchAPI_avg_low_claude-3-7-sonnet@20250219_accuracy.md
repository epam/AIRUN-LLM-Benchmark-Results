# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type
  
  The code correctly implements a search input field with the `onChange` handler updating the `searchQuery` state:
  ```tsx
  <input
      type="text"
      placeholder="Search characters by name..."
      value={searchQuery}
      onChange={(e) => setSearchQuery(e.target.value)}
      style={{...}}
  />
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls
  
  The code implements a debouncing pattern with a 500ms delay using `useEffect` and `setTimeout`:
  ```tsx
  useEffect(() => {
      const handler = setTimeout(() => {
          setDebouncedSearchQuery(searchQuery);
      }, 500); // 500ms debounce delay
      
      return () => {
          clearTimeout(handler);
      };
  }, [searchQuery]);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured
  
  The code uses axios for API requests in the `fetchCharacters` function:
  ```tsx
  const response = await axios.get<SwapiPeopleResponse>(apiUrl);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses
  
  The code includes proper TypeScript typing throughout:
  - Interface definitions for `Character` and `SwapiPeopleResponse`
  - Type annotations for state variables (`useState<string>`, `useState<Character[]>`, etc.)
  - Component typing (`React.FC`)
  - API response typing (`axios.get<SwapiPeopleResponse>`)

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters
  
  The API endpoint is correctly constructed with the search parameter:
  ```tsx
  const apiUrl = `https://swapi.dev/api/people/?search=${encodeURIComponent(query)}`;
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate
  
  The code implements `useCallback` for the `fetchCharacters` function:
  ```tsx
  const fetchCharacters = useCallback(async (query: string) => {
      // implementation
  }, []);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback
  
  Error handling is implemented with try/catch and appropriate user feedback:
  ```tsx
  try {
      // API call
  } catch (err) {
      console.error('Failed to fetch characters:', err);
      if (axios.isAxiosError(err)) {
           setError(err.message || 'An error occurred while fetching data.');
      } else {
           setError('An unexpected error occurred.');
      }
      setCharacters([]);
  }
  ```
  
  And the error is displayed to the user:
  ```tsx
  {error && <div style={{ color: 'red', marginBottom: '20px' }}>Error: {error}</div>}
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing
  
  API calls are triggered only after the debounced search query changes, which happens after the user stops typing for 500ms:
  ```tsx
  useEffect(() => {
      fetchCharacters(debouncedSearchQuery);
  }, [debouncedSearchQuery, fetchCharacters]);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices
  
  The state management follows React best practices:
  - Separate states for user input (`searchQuery`) and debounced value (`debouncedSearchQuery`)
  - Clear separation of concerns with loading, error, and data states
  - Appropriate use of `useEffect` for side effects
  - Proper dependencies in `useEffect` dependency arrays

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code
  
  The code is free of console errors and unused imports. There are some commented-out lines, but they serve as documentation rather than unused code:
  ```tsx
  // SWAPI response also includes count, next, previous, but we only need results for this task
  // count: number;
  // next: string | null;
  // previous: string | null;
  ```
  These comments explain the full API response structure but clarify that only the used parts are included in the interface.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests
  
  Loading state is properly managed:
  ```tsx
  // Set loading state before API call
  setLoading(true);
  
  // Clear loading state after API call (in finally block)
  finally {
      setLoading(false);
  }
  ```
  
  And displayed to the user:
  ```tsx
  {loading && <div>Loading...</div>}
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns
  
  The component follows React 18.x patterns with functional components, hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`), and proper state management.
