# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type  
  The input field is bound to the state variable "searchQuery" and correctly updates via the onChange handler.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls  
  A useEffect is configured with a 500ms delay before updating the debounced search state, fulfilling the debouncing requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured  
  The code utilizes axios.get with proper TypeScript generics and error handling, indicating correct configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses  
  The component, its state variables, and API response are well-typed using TypeScript interfaces and explicit useState typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters  
  The API URL is constructed using template literals with encodeURIComponent to safely include the search parameter.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate  
  The fetchCharacters function is wrapped with useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-creations when dependencies have not changed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback  
  The try/catch block captures API errors, and the error message is displayed to the user in the UI, ensuring clear feedback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing  
  The separation of searchQuery and debouncedSearchQuery states with a 500ms delay ensures that API calls occur only after the user stops typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices  
  The code cleanly separates immediate input state from debounced state and properly manages side effects, adhering to React best practices.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code  
  There are minor commented-out lines within the interface (e.g., additional SWAPI response properties) for explanatory purposes. Although not strictly "clean" in an ideal production setup, these comments are informative and do not affect functionality. The rest of the code is clean and free from unused imports or console errors.  
  (Confidence is 90% because some might prefer removal of commented-out boilerplate code.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests  
  The loading state is correctly set before fetching the data and is reliably reset in the finally block, ensuring proper UI feedback during network operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns  
  The component fully utilizes functional components, hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback), and follows modern practices consistent with React 18.x.
