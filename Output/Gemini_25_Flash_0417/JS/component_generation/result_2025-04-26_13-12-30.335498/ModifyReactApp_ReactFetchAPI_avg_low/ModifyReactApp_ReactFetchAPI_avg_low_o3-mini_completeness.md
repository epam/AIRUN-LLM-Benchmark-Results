# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The code includes an <input> element with the placeholder "Search characters by name...", and its value is tied to the state variable "searchQuery". This confirms that the search input field is present and intended to filter the character list.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  The component conditionally renders a "Loading..." message when the state variable "loading" is true. This ensures that users receive a visual indication during API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  On mount, the state "debouncedSearchQuery" is initialized as an empty string, triggering the useEffect that calls "fetchCharacters('')" to load all characters initially. This meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  As the user types, "searchQuery" is updated immediately and then debounced (after 500ms) before triggering the API call. This debouncing mechanism ensures that search results update dynamically without overwhelming API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  The rendering logic displays a "No results found." message when there are no characters to show (and when not in loading or error states), providing clear feedback when a search yields no matches.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The inline styling for the input field uses "width: 100%" with a "maxWidth: 400px" and "boxSizing: border-box", ensuring that the component adjusts responsively based on the container's width.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  The code correctly maps over the "characters" state array to display each characterâ€™s name after the API response without altering the intended functionality.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  The code includes a try-catch block within the API call function "fetchCharacters", setting an "error" state and rendering an error message when an exception occurs. While this handles API errors effectively, it does not use a dedicated React Error Boundary component. However, given the context, the error handling implemented is appropriate.  
  (Reduced confidence to 90% due to the nuance between error state handling and full React error boundaries.)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The component defines the "Character" and "SwapiPeopleResponse" interfaces for API responses, and the component itself is properly typed as a React functional component (React.FC). This meets the TypeScript requirements.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The implementation preserves the original behavior (e.g., fetching all characters when the search query is empty) and adds the search functionality without breaking the existing logic.
