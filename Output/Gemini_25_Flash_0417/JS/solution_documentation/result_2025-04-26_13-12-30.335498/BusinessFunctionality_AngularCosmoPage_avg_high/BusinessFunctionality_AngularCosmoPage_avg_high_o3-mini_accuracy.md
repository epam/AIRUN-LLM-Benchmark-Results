- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately describes the REST factory for backend communication  
  The explanation details how the REST factory uses Angular’s $resource to map to multiple backend API endpoints and defines methods for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation correctly explains the Page factory for storing global page variables  
  The documentation correctly outlines that the Page factory holds the state and data of the current page, and shows how it is used across controllers for data sharing and updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately describes the Users factory for storing current user data  
  The Users factory is described as maintaining data about the currently logged-in user, which aligns with its usage in the code for identifying the author when saving pages.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation correctly explains the page controller functionality  
  The explanation covers how the page controller binds data from the Page factory to the view, handles user interactions, performs validation, makes API calls via the REST factory, and manages both saving and deleting operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation accurately explains the page creation and editing process  
  The documentation provides a clear, step-by-step description of both creating a new page and editing an existing page, including auto-generation of URLs, form input handling, and redirection after saving.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately describes the local storage recovery mechanism for unsaved changes  
  The explanation details how unsaved changes are saved to localStorage, detected upon revisiting the page, and how the user can choose to discard, compare, or restore them.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation correctly explains the version comparison and management features  
  The documentation mentions the presence of unsaved version warnings, the ability to compare revisions (via the “Compare” button), and the process for updating local data, which covers version comparison and management.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation accurately describes the page deletion workflow  
  The deletion process is detailed step by step—from clicking the delete button to confirming the deletion, triggering API calls to delete the page and associated data, and redirecting the user.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately explains the auto-URL generation from title functionality  
  It is noted that the application automatically generates a URL from the title when creating or editing a page, which aligns with the code behavior described.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation correctly describes the tag autocompletion and suggestion system
