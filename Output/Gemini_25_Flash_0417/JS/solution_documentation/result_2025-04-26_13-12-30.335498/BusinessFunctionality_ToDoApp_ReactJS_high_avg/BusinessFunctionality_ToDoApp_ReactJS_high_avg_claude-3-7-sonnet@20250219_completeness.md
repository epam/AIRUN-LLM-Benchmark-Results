    The document does mention pluralization, but only briefly in the "Utils" section where it states: "providing utility functions: generating unique IDs (`uuid`), pluralizing words (`pluralize`), interacting with `localStorage` (`store`), and shallow object merging (`extend`)." It also mentions that the TodoFooter component "Displays summary information (number of active items)." While pluralization is mentioned, the document doesn't explicitly explain how the pluralization function works to change "item" to "items" based on count. However, it does indicate that pluralization is handled, so I'm rating this as a pass with 90% confidence.
