# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document identifies the application as a Todo list management application  
  The document clearly states that the application implements the TodoMVC pattern using React, describing its functionality as a standard task management (Todo list) interface.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the component structure (TodoApp, TodoItem, TodoFooter)  
  The report provides detailed descriptions of the core components, including the roles and interrelationships of TodoApp, TodoItem, and TodoFooter.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of local storage for data persistence  
  The explanation explicitly mentions that the application leverages the browser's localStorage to persist the todos, outlining how data is saved and loaded.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the state management approach using the TodoModel  
  The document details the use of a separate TodoModel for managing the todos array and explains the observer pattern used to trigger re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the routing mechanism for filtering todos  
  The report discusses the use of a hash-based routing solution via an external Router, which changes the application state based on URL hash changes.
