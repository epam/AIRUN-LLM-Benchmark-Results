# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented

    The answer includes comprehensive implementation of all page management functionality:
    - Create: Through the `savePage` thunk that handles new page creation
    - Update: Using the same `savePage` thunk with logic to update existing pages
    - Delete: Implemented in the `deletePage` thunk
    - Duplicate: Handled in the `savePage` thunk with a `duplicate` parameter

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present

    Page type selection is implemented with a dropdown select element that displays theme page options. The code includes:
    - A select element that binds to `currentPage.type` 
    - Logic to populate the dropdown from `themePages` array
    - Event handling to update the Redux state when selection changes

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists

    The URL auto-generation logic is fully implemented:
    - `autoURL` state maintains whether auto-URL is enabled
    - When the title changes and `autoURL` is true, the URL is automatically generated
    - Logic to format the title by replacing spaces with hyphens and removing special characters

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented

    Tag management with autocomplete is thoroughly implemented:
    - Input field for tags with comma-separated values
    - Conversion between string input and array storage
    - `fetchTagSuggestions` thunk to retrieve tag suggestions
    - UI to display suggestions and logic to select them
    - Event handlers to manage tag input, suggestions, and selection

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are present

    The solution implements all three publish status options:
    - Radio buttons for "Publish" (Y), "Draft" (N), and "Schedule" options
    - Handlers to update the `currentPage.publish` value
    - Logic to handle different publish statuses when saving

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented

    Scheduled publishing functionality is properly implemented:
    - Conditional rendering of datetime-local input when "Schedule" is selected
    - Logic to validate the schedule date
    - Conversion between ISO string format and timestamp
    - Proper handling of past dates by automatically publishing instead of scheduling

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present

    Local storage comparison and restoration are well-implemented:
    - Checking for newer versions in local storage on component mount
    - UI to show when a newer version exists with options to use, compare, or discard
    - Functions to handle restoring or discarding local storage data
    - Debounced saving of form data to local storage

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented

    The notification system is completely implemented:
    - A dedicated notifications slice in Redux
    - The `NotificationDisplay` component to show notifications
    - Actions to show, hide, and clear notifications
    - Automatic removal of notifications after a specified duration
    - Notification dispatching throughout the code for various success/error scenarios

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present

    Form validation for required fields is implemented:
    - Validation for URL (checking for empty or "new" URL)
    - Validation for page type selection
    - Error notifications displayed for validation failures
    - Prevention of save/update when validation fails

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled

    All API endpoints from the original code are handled:
    - Content endpoints for CRUD operations
    - Tag endpoints for managing content tags
    - Extras endpoints for handling page extras
    - Revision endpoints for managing page revisions
    - Appropriate error handling for all API calls

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented

    The extras management functionality is properly implemented:
    - Data structures to store extras in the page state
    - API service methods to save, update, and delete extras
    - Logic in the save thunk to handle extras for both new and existing pages
    - Handling of extras in both content and revisions

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained

    Revision history functionality is maintained:
    - Creation of new revisions when saving pages
    - Saving extras to revisions
    - API methods for managing revisions and revision extras
    - Proper cleanup of revisions when deleting pages

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components

    The code is well-organized into feature folders with clear separation:
    - `api/` folder for API service
    - `components/` folder for UI components
    - `features/` folder for Redux slices and business logic
    - `hooks/` folder for custom React hooks
    - `store/` folder for Redux store configuration
    - `types/` folder for TypeScript interfaces
    - `i18n/` folder for internationalization
    - Clear separation between UI components and business logic in Redux slices

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved

    All translation functionality is preserved:
    - Implementation of i18n configuration
    - Use of translation keys throughout the UI
    - Translation hook for component usage
    - Translation for all UI elements and messages

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters

    The application maintains the same URL structure:
    - `/pages/new` for creating new pages
    - `/pages/:url` for editing existing pages
    - React Router configuration that matches the original URL structure
    - Handling of URL parameters to fetch and display the correct page data
