# Evaluation Report

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
  The answer includes Redux thunks for creating (savePage with duplicate flag handling), updating, and deleting pages. Duplicate logic is handled via a flag in the savePage thunk.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
  The PageEditor component provides a select element for page types using the list from the Redux state.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
  The reducer’s updatePageField action (when handling the title) includes logic to auto-generate a URL (by converting to lowercase, replacing spaces with hyphens, and removing punctuation) if autoURL is enabled.

- **Pass (100%)**: Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
  The implementation includes an input for tags with ng‑list–like behavior, a debounce mechanism to fetch autocomplete suggestions via a thunk, and a handler to select a suggestion.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
  The component uses radio buttons to allow choosing between “Y” (publish), “N” (draft), and “schedule”.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
  There is conditional rendering of a datetime‑local input for scheduled publishing, and the savePage thunk converts the schedule date appropriately to a timestamp.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
  The code uses local storage keys (with a URL‑based prefix) to store and compare form fields, and provides handlers to restore or discard the locally stored version.

- **Pass (100%)**: Validate that the notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
  The answer implements a notificationSlice with actions for showing and hiding notifications, as well as a NotificationDisplay component that shows these messages.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
  The savePage thunk performs validations, checking that a page type is selected and that a valid URL is provided, dispatching error notifications as needed.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
  The API service includes endpoints for content (get, post, put, delete), tags, extras, revisions, and revision extras, matching the original REST API design.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
  The Redux slice and savePage thunk include logic to manage extras (and revision extras) through the corresponding API calls, and actions exist to update extras in the state.

- **Pass (100%)**: Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
  Thunks call saveContentRevision and saveContentRevisionExtra methods to handle revision history, mirroring the Angular implementation.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
  The provided structure clearly separates API services, Redux slices (features), hooks, types, components, and store configuration.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
  The answer sets up internationalization with react‑i18next, loads translation JSON files, and uses the t() function in both components and thunks.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
  The React Router configuration defines routes matching the original structure (e.g., /pages/new and /pages/:url) so that URL parameters are maintained.
