# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The SignupComponent imports and uses FormBuilder to create a reactive FormGroup, and the app module imports ReactiveFormsModule.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The form setup enforces Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3) and Validators.maxLength(60) for the name, Validators.required and Validators.email for the email, and Validators.required along with Validators.minLength(6) for the password.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  Custom async validators (nameAsyncValidator and emailAsyncValidator) query the API via the injected ApiService to check for name and email availability.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The FormGroupComponent template applies Bootstrap classes based on control states (touched, valid, invalid, pending) and conditionally displays error messages.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  In the onSubmit() method, if the form is valid, it dispatches the signup action with the form values, triggering the NgRx effects that call the ApiService.signup method.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The FormGroupComponentâ€™s template includes markup to show specific error messages when the control is touched and invalid.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  The SignupComponent uses titleService.setTitle(getTitle('Signup')) in ngOnInit to set the browser tab title appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The code integrates NgRx by dispatching actions from the component, selecting state via selectors, and handling side-effects in AuthEffects.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button is disabled when the form is invalid or while submitting (using the (submitting$ | async) observable).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  The ApiService.signup method correctly calls the HTTP POST endpoint and uses catchError to handle API errors, re-throwing the error in a proper format.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  Components use constructor injection, implement OnInit and OnDestroy (with proper unsubscription), and are organized in a modular way following Angular conventions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The ApiService employs HttpClient from @angular/common/http along with RxJS operators instead of using promises.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  Error messages for required fields, min/max length violations, invalid email format, and custom errors for name/email already taken are defined and displayed as expected.
