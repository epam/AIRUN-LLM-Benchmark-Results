# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The solution explicitly uses Angular 14, as evidenced by the installation commands:
  ```bash
  ng add @ngrx/store@14
  ng add @ngrx/effects@14
  ng add @ngrx/store-devtools@14
  ng add @ngrx/router-store@14
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
  
  The solution implements NgRx store throughout the application. It includes proper store setup in the AppModule:
  ```typescript
  StoreModule.forRoot({}, {})
  ```
  And in the TodosModule:
  ```typescript
  StoreModule.forFeature('todos', todosReducer)
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
  
  The solution includes @ngrx/effects for handling side effects like loading todos from localStorage, persisting todos, and synchronizing with the router. Effects are registered in AppModule and TodosModule:
  ```typescript
  EffectsModule.forRoot([])
  EffectsModule.forFeature([TodosEffects])
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
  
  The solution includes comprehensive implementation of:
  - Actions in todos-actions.ts (loadTodos, addTodo, toggleTodo, etc.)
  - Reducer in todos-reducer.ts with proper state management
  - Selectors in todos.selectors.ts (selectAllTodos, selectFilteredTodos, etc.)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
  
  All components use the @Component decorator with proper configuration. @Input and @Output decorators are used for component communication, such as in the TodoItemComponent:
  ```typescript
  @Input() todo!: ITodo;
  @Input() editing!: boolean;
  @Output() toggle = new EventEmitter<void>();
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators
  
  React refs are replaced with @ViewChild. For example:
  ```typescript
  @ViewChild('newField') newFieldInput!: ElementRef<HTMLInputElement>;
  @ViewChild('editField') editFieldInput!: ElementRef<HTMLInputElement>;
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
  
  The solution uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() with EventEmitter for event handling. This is properly implemented in the TodoItemComponent and TodoFooterComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
  
  The solution uses UtilsService to encapsulate helper methods like uuid generation and localStorage interactions:
  ```typescript
  @Injectable({
    providedIn: 'root'
  })
  export class UtilsService {
    uuid(): string { ... }
    pluralize(count: number, word: string): string { ... }
    store(namespace: string, data?: ITodo[]): ITodo[] | null { ... }
  }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
  
  Dependency injection is correctly implemented throughout the application, with services and store being injected into components and effects:
  ```typescript
  constructor(
    private actions$: Actions,
    private utilsService: UtilsService,
    private store: Store<TodosState>,
    private router: Router
  ) {}
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
  
  ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush is applied to all components for performance optimization:
  ```typescript
  @Component({
    selector: 'app-todos-container',
    templateUrl: './todos-container.component.html',
    styleUrls: ['./todos-container.component.css'],
    changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
  })
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
  
  Angular Router is properly implemented with hash-based routing, and integrated with NgRx through @ngrx/router-store:
  ```typescript
  RouterModule.forRoot(routes, { useHash: true })
  StoreRouterConnectingModule.forRoot()
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code follows Angular style guide conventions including:
  - Proper file and folder structure
  - Feature modules
  - Consistent naming conventions
  - Component selectors with app prefix
  - Clear separation of concerns

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
  
  TypeScript interfaces and types are well-maintained throughout the application, such as:
  ```typescript
  export interface ITodo {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    completed: boolean;
  }
  export type TodoFilter = 'all' | 'active' | 'completed';
  export interface TodosState { ... }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
  
  All JSX templates are correctly converted to Angular HTML templates using Angular's template syntax, directives, and binding:
  ```html
  <li [ngClass]="{ completed: todo.completed, editing: editing }">
    <div class="view">
      <input
        class="toggle"
        type="checkbox"
        [checked]="todo.completed"
        (change)="toggle.emit()"
      />
      <!-- ... -->
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
  
  React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings:
  ```html
  <input
    #newField
    class="new-todo"
    placeholder="What needs to be done?"
    (keydown)="handleNewTodoKeyDown($event)"
    autofocus
  />
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs
  
  The code does not contain any TODOs. All functionality has been fully implemented.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules
  
  The solution does not implement lazy loading for feature modules. The TodosModule is directly imported in the AppModule:
  ```typescript
  imports: [
    // ...
    TodosModule // Import the feature module
  ]
  ```
  
  For lazy loading, it should use the loadChildren syntax in the routing module instead of directly importing the module.
