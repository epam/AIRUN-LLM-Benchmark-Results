# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items
  
  The solution implements a proper display of todo items in the `TodosContainerComponent`. The component subscribes to `filteredTodos$` observable and uses `*ngFor` to iterate through the items in the template. The todo items are loaded from localStorage on component initialization.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented
  
  The solution implements the add functionality in the `handleNewTodoKeyDown` method of the `TodosContainerComponent`. It dispatches the `addTodo` action when a user enters text and presses the Enter key. The effect `addTodo$` handles generating the UUID and adds the item to the store via the `addTodoSuccess` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works
  
  The solution handles toggling individual todo items through the `onToggleTodo` method which dispatches the `toggleTodo` action. The reducer properly updates the state by mapping through todos and toggling the completed status of the matching item.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented
  
  The solution implements editing functionality through:
  1. Storing the editing todo ID in state
  2. Dispatching the `setEditingTodoId` action when double-clicking a todo
  3. The `TodoItemComponent` handling input changes with local state tracking
  4. Dispatching the `saveTodo` action on blur or Enter key press

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented
  
  The solution implements the delete functionality through the `onDestroyTodo` method which dispatches the `destroyTodo` action. The reducer properly removes the todo by filtering out the matching ID.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented
  
  The solution implements the "Mark all as complete" functionality through the `toggleAll` method in `TodosContainerComponent`. It dispatches the `toggleAllTodos` action with the selected state. The reducer properly updates all todos by mapping through them and setting their completed status.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works
  
  The solution implements filtering through:
  1. Router configuration that maps URL paths to filters
  2. The `syncFilterWithRoute$` effect that dispatches the `setFilter` action when routes change
  3. The `selectFilteredTodos` selector that properly filters todos based on the current filter value
  4. The `TodoFooterComponent` rendering links that navigate to the appropriate routes

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The solution displays the active item count in the footer by:
  1. Creating a `selectActiveTodoCount` selector that counts non-completed todos
  2. Passing this count to the `TodoFooterComponent` via the `count` input property
  3. Rendering the count with appropriate pluralization in the template

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items
  
  The solution implements clearing completed todos through the `clearCompleted` method in `TodosContainerComponent`. It dispatches the `clearCompletedTodos` action which triggers the reducer to filter out completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage
  
  The solution implements persistence through the `persistTodos$` effect. This effect listens for all actions that modify the todos array, retrieves the current todos using `withLatestFrom`, and saves them to localStorage using the `UtilsService`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation
  
  The solution maintains the URL structure by:
  1. Configuring the Angular Router with `useHash: true` to match the original hash-based routing
  2. Setting up routes that match the original paths (`/`, `/active`, `/completed`)
  3. The `syncFilterWithRoute$` effect translates routes to filter states

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states
  
  The solution handles empty states by using `*ngIf` directives in the template. The main section is only shown when there are todos (`*ngIf="(filteredTodos$ | async)?.length > 0"`). The footer is only shown when there are active or completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly
  
  The solution properly handles form submissions with appropriate key event handling:
  1. `handleNewTodoKeyDown` in `TodosContainerComponent` processes Enter key presses (ENTER_KEY)
  2. `handleKeyDown` in `TodoItemComponent` processes both Enter and Escape keys
  3. Blur events trigger form submission in editing mode
  4. Empty submissions are handled correctly (destroying the todo when the edited title is empty)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships
  
  The solution maintains proper component relationships by:
  1. Using a container/presentational component pattern
  2. Properly passing data down via `@Input()` decorators
  3. Emitting events up via `@Output()` EventEmitters
  4. Maintaining separation of concerns between components, state management, and effects

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved
  
  The solution preserves all business logic from the original application through:
  1. Converting the `TodoModel` to NgRx state, actions, reducers and effects
  2. Converting `Utils` to an Angular service
  3. Preserving all CRUD operations, filtering, persistence, and UI interactions
  4. Maintaining the same validation logic (e.g., handling empty submissions)
