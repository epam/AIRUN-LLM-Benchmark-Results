# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The answer clearly instructs creating the project with Angular CLI and makes use of NgRx packages with version “@14”. This confirms the Angular 14.x usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The solution imports and configures @ngrx/store appropriately via StoreModule.forRoot and StoreModule.forFeature, showing state management is handled using NgRx.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  The provided code includes a full implementation of NgRx Effects (TodosEffects) and registers them through EffectsModule.forFeature and EffectsModule.forRoot.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  The answer includes clearly defined actions, reducers in the todos-reducer.ts file, as well as selectors in todos.selectors.ts making the NgRx store complete and well structured.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  Every component (e.g., TodosContainerComponent, TodoItemComponent, TodoFooterComponent) is implemented using @Component and properly employs @Input and @Output decorators.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  The code uses @ViewChild (e.g., for the new todo input and in TodoItemComponent) to reference DOM elements instead of React refs.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  The solution clearly demonstrates the usage of @Input for passing properties and @Output with EventEmitter for sending events upward, following standard Angular communication practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  A dedicated UtilsService is implemented to encapsulate utility methods such as generating UUIDs, pluralization, and localStorage persistence, which follows Angular service practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  Angular’s dependency injection is used effectively throughout the code (e.g., injecting UtilsService, Store, Router in constructors).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  Components like TodosContainerComponent and TodoItemComponent utilize ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush to optimize performance.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  The application uses Angular Router in app-routing.module.ts with hash-based routing and employs routerLink in templates to manage navigation.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The overall structure, naming conventions, and file organization follow common Angular best practices. Minor variations may exist based on individual style interpretations, but overall the conventions are properly maintained.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  The code consistently uses TypeScript interfaces (e.g., ITodo, TodosState) and types, ensuring type safety across the project.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  All UI components have been successfully converted to Angular HTML templates using directives such as *ngIf and *ngFor.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  The event handling is suitably implemented using Angular event binding syntax (e.g., (click), (keydown), (change)), replacing the original React event system.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  The provided answer includes comments for clarification but does not contain any unresolved TODOs that remain in the final code.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  Although the Angular CLI command to generate a feature module with a route was mentioned initially, the final configuration in app.module.ts explicitly imports the TodosModule. This inclusion prevents the module from being lazy-loaded via the router. For true lazy loading, the feature module should be loaded via the loadChildren property in the routing configuration rather than direct import.
