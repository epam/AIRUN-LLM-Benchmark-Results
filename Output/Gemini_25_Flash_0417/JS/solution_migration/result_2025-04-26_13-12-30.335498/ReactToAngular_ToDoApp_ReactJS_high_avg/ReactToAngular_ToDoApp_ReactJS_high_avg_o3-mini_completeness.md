# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The TodosContainerComponent uses an *ngFor loop on the filtered todos observable, ensuring that all todos are rendered.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The new todo input in the main container dispatches the addTodo action on ENTER keydown, and an effect generates the todo with a unique ID.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  The TodoItemComponent emits a toggle event when its checkbox is changed, and the container dispatches the toggleTodo action accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent supports editing through a double-click handler that triggers the edit, and saves are processed via form submission events.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  The destroy action is emitted from the TodoItemComponent and handled by the store to remove the todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  The main container includes a checkbox that, when toggled, dispatches the toggleAllTodos action to mark all todos complete/incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  The router configuration and the syncFilterWithRoute effect work together to update the filter state, and selectors filter the todos accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooterComponent displays the active todos count using data from the store’s selector.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The footer includes a "Clear completed" button, which dispatches the clearCompletedTodos action to remove completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  An NgRx effect listens to state-changing actions and uses the UtilsService to save the current todos to localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The routing configuration (with hash-based URLs and parameterized routes) ensures that navigation (all, active, completed) follows the expected URL structure.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  The main section’s *ngIf and footer components are conditionally displayed based on the availability of active or completed todos.  
  Explanation: While the UI changes based on todo counts, an explicit empty state message is not provided; however, the conditional logic effectively handles the empty state scenario.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  The new todo input captures key events properly and prevents default behavior, ensuring that valid submissions dispatch their corresponding action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The application is well-structured into feature modules and components (container, item, and footer), maintaining a clear separation of concerns and hierarchy.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  All core functionalities such as adding, toggling, editing, deleting, filtering, and persisting are maintained via NgRx actions, reducers, effects, and the shared UtilsService.
