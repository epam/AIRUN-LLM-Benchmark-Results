# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The application explicitly specifies Angular 14.x through the NgRx package installation command: `ng add @ngrx/store@14 @ngrx/effects@14 @ngrx/store-devtools@14`. The code also follows Angular 14.x patterns and syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS
  
  The code exclusively uses ES modules with TypeScript import/export syntax throughout all files, replacing the original RequireJS dependency system.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management
  
  NgRx Store is properly implemented with the store configuration in the CoreModule, proper import of StoreModule.forRoot(), and store injection in components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects
  
  NgRx Effects is properly implemented with EffectsModule.forRoot([TodoEffects]) in CoreModule and TodoEffects class with properly defined effects for loading and saving todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management
  
  The implementation includes comprehensive todo actions (load, add, remove, update, toggle, clear), a well-structured reducer handling all actions, multiple selectors for different data needs, and effects for loading from and saving to localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator
  
  The TodoStorageService is properly decorated with `@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })` making it available throughout the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service
  
  TodoStorageService properly implements localStorage for persistence with get() and put() methods that handle JSON serialization/deserialization and includes error handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators
  
  All components (TodoAppContainerComponent, TodoHeaderComponent, TodoListComponent, TodoItemComponent, TodoFooterComponent) properly use the @Component decorator with appropriate selector, templateUrl, and styleUrls properties.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators
  
  Both custom directives (TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective) properly use the @Directive decorator with appropriate selector.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)
  
  Component templates correctly use Angular template syntax including *ngFor with trackBy in TodoListComponent, *ngIf for conditional rendering, the async pipe for observables, and Angular's binding syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))
  
  All event bindings use proper Angular syntax with parentheses, such as (click), (change), (submit), (blur), (dblclick), and custom events like (todoEscape).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])
  
  The code correctly uses property binding syntax with square brackets, including [ngClass], [checked], [todoFocus], and attribute binding syntax [class.selected].

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed
  
  The code properly implements lifecycle hooks including ngOnInit in TodoAppContainerComponent for initialization and route parameter subscription, ngOnDestroy for cleanup, and ngOnChanges in TodoItemComponent and TodoFocusDirective.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models
  
  TypeScript interfaces are properly defined and used, including Todo interface, TodoFilter type, TodoState interface, and AppState interface for strong typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services
  
  The code properly uses dependency injection in component constructors for Store, ActivatedRoute, and TodoStorageService. Service dependencies are also properly injected in the TodoEffects class.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code follows Angular style guide conventions including proper naming (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for classes), feature modules, component organization, and one class per file.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings
  
  The code includes proper error handling in services and effects, and there are no apparent issues that would cause console errors or warnings during normal operation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)
  
  TypeScript features are used appropriately throughout the codebase, including interfaces for models and state, type annotations for variables and function parameters/returns, generics with observables, and strict null checking with the non-null assertion operator (!) where appropriate.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code
  
  The submitted code does not contain any TODO comments or commented-out blocks that would indicate incomplete work or debugging remnants.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design
  
  The application follows the single responsibility principle with:
  - A clear separation between the "smart" container component (TodoAppContainerComponent) and "presentational" components
  - Well-defined components for each UI section (header, list, item, footer)
  - Separate services for data storage
  - Clean separation of concerns between components, services, and state management
