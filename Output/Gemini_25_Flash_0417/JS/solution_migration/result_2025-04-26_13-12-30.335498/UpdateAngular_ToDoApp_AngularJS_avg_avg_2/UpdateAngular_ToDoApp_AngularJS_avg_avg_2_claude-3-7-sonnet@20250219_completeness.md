# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list

    The application includes the `TodoListComponent` which is responsible for displaying the list of todos. This component is defined in `src/app/todo/components/todo-list/todo-list.component.ts` and has a corresponding HTML template that renders the todos using `*ngFor` directive.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos

    The application includes the `TodoHeaderComponent` which provides functionality for adding new todos. This component is defined in `src/app/todo/components/todo-header/todo-header.component.ts` and includes an input field and form submission handling to add new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos

    The application includes the `TodoItemComponent` which handles editing of existing todos. This component is defined in `src/app/todo/components/todo-item/todo-item.component.ts` and provides functionality to edit a todo when double-clicking on it.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos

    The application includes the `TodoFooterComponent` which provides navigation links for filtering todos. This component is defined in `src/app/todo/components/todo-footer/todo-footer.component.ts` and includes links for filtering todos by 'All', 'Active', and 'Completed' states.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics

    The `TodoFooterComponent` also displays count statistics. It shows the number of remaining items ("X items left") and conditionally shows a button to clear completed todos when completed todos exist.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos

    The implementation includes functionality to add new todos through the `onAddTodo` method in `TodoAppContainerComponent` which dispatches the `addTodo` action to the NgRx store. The input is handled by the `TodoHeaderComponent`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos

    The application implements functionality to edit existing todos through the `onUpdateTodo` method in `TodoAppContainerComponent` which dispatches the `updateTodo` action to the NgRx store. The editing UI is handled by the `TodoItemComponent`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos

    The implementation includes functionality to delete todos through the `onRemoveTodo` method in `TodoAppContainerComponent` which dispatches the `removeTodo` action to the NgRx store. The delete button UI is provided in the `TodoItemComponent`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed

    The application implements functionality to mark todos as completed through the `onToggleComplete` method in `TodoAppContainerComponent` which dispatches the `updateTodo` action with a changes object that toggles the completed state. The checkbox UI is provided in the `TodoItemComponent`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)

    The implementation includes functionality to filter todos through route parameters. The `TodoFooterComponent` includes navigation links, and the `TodoAppContainerComponent` listens to route changes to dispatch the `setFilter` action. The NgRx selector `selectFilteredTodos` applies the filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete

    The application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete through the `onToggleAllComplete` method in `TodoAppContainerComponent` which dispatches the `toggleAllComplete` action. The toggle-all checkbox UI is provided in the container template.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos

    The implementation includes functionality to clear completed todos through the `onClearCompleted` method in `TodoAppContainerComponent` which dispatches the `clearCompleted` action. The clear button UI is provided in the `TodoFooterComponent`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos

    The application displays the count of remaining todos in the `TodoFooterComponent` using the `remainingCount` input which is bound to the `selectRemainingCount` selector from the NgRx store.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage

    The application persists todos in localStorage through the `TodoStorageService` which provides `get` and `put` methods to interact with localStorage. The `saveTodos$` effect in `TodoEffects` calls the `put` method when todos are modified.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization

    The application loads persisted todos on initialization through the `loadTodos` action which is dispatched in `ngOnInit` of the `TodoAppContainerComponent`. The `loadTodos$` effect in `TodoEffects` calls the `get` method of `TodoStorageService`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing

    The application handles escape key press to cancel editing through the `TodoEscapeDirective` which listens for the ESC key and emits an event. The `TodoItemComponent` binds to this event with `(todoEscape)="onEscape()"` and implements the `revertEditing` method to cancel editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo

    The application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo through the `TodoFocusDirective` which sets focus on the element when its input value becomes true. The `TodoItemComponent` uses this directive with `[todoFocus]="isEditing"`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original

    The application maintains the same visual appearance as the original by including the original TodoMVC CSS files. The CSS imports are specified in the `angular.json` file, importing both `todomvc-common/base.css` and `todomvc-app-css/index.css`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately

    The application handles empty todo titles appropriately in multiple places:
    1. In the `TodoHeaderComponent`, it trims the input and only emits the `addTodo` event if the trimmed title is not empty.
    2. In the `TodoItemComponent`, it removes the todo if the trimmed title is empty after editing.
    3. The `addTodo` action in the reducer also trims the title.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter

    The application updates the URL based on the selected filter through the Angular Router. The `TodoFooterComponent` includes links with `routerLink` directives pointing to `/all`, `/active`, and `/completed`, which update the URL. The `TodoRoutingModule` defines these routes.
