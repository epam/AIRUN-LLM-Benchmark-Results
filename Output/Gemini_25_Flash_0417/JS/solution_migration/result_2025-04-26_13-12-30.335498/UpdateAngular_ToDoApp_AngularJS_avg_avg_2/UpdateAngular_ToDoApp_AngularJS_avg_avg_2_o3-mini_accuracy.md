# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The code is set up for Angular 14.x, as evidenced by the project's creation with Angular CLI and the use of Angular-specific decorators and modules.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
  The migration removed RequireJS and now relies on standard ES modules with proper Angular module imports.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
  NgRx Store is set up in the Core module via StoreModule.forRoot with a defined reducer for the todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
  NgRx Effects has been implemented to manage the asynchronous loading and saving of todos via localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
  The actions, reducers, selectors, and effects for todo management are well defined and correctly organized to handle CRUD operations, filtering, and persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
  The TodoStorageService is decorated with @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }), ensuring correct dependency injection throughout the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
  The TodoStorageService directly interacts with localStorage, providing get and put methods for persisting todo data.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
  All components (e.g., TodoAppContainerComponent, TodoHeaderComponent, etc.) are decorated with @Component, and templates/styles are properly linked.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
  Both custom directives (todoFocus and todoEscape) are implemented with the @Directive decorator and use Angular binding mechanisms.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
  The templates use Angularâ€™s structural directives such as *ngFor, *ngIf, and the async pipe appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
  Event bindings such as (click), (submit), (blur), and (dblclick) are correctly utilized within the component templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
  The property bindings (e.g., [ngClass], [checked]) are correctly applied in the component templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
  Components use lifecycle hooks such as ngOnInit, ngOnDestroy, and ngOnChanges where appropriate to manage initialization and cleanup.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
  The Todo interface and TodoFilter type are clearly defined and used throughout the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
  The application injects needed services and the store via constructor parameters in the components and effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code adheres to Angular style guides with well-separated modules, clearly named components/directives, and usage of OnPush change detection where appropriate.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
  Based on the provided code and structure, no issues (console errors or warnings) are expected when compiled and run.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
  The code utilizes proper TypeScript features such as explicit types, interfaces, and strict type checking, ensuring clarity and maintainability.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
  The provided code is clean and does not include leftover TODOs or commented-out sections.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design  
  Each component, service, and module has a well-defined, single responsibility, improving maintainability and testability.
