# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list  
  The solution includes a dedicated presentational component, "TodoListComponent" (selector: app-todo-list), which is responsible for displaying the list of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos  
  The solution defines a "TodoHeaderComponent" (selector: app-todo-header) which contains the input field and form submission logic for adding new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos  
  The "TodoItemComponent" is provided for each individual todo, and it includes the logic for entering an editing state (with methods onEdit, doneEditing, and handling blur/escape events).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos  
  The "TodoFooterComponent" (selector: app-todo-footer) includes router links for "All", "Active", and "Completed" filters. Additionally, the container component reads the filter from the URL.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics  
  The "TodoFooterComponent" displays the count of remaining todos and uses helper logic to display the count (via remainingCount and remainingText).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos  
  New todos are added via the form in the TodoHeaderComponent and processed by the container component dispatching the addTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos  
  Editing is implemented in the TodoItemComponent where double-clicking enters edit mode and pressing Enter (or on blur) finishes editing, dispatching an updateTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos  
  The TodoItemComponent includes a button (class "destroy") that triggers removal via the removeTodo event.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed  
  A checkbox in the TodoItemComponent toggles the "completed" state and dispatches an updateTodo action to mark the todo as completed/incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)  
  Filter links in the TodoFooterComponent use routerLink directives to update the URL. The container component listens to route parameters and dispatches the setFilter action accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete  
  The container component includes an input with id "toggle-all" that, on change, dispatches the toggleAllComplete action based on its checked state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos  
  The TodoFooterComponent provides a “Clear completed” button that dispatches the clearCompleted action when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos  
  The remaining count is calculated via selectors and displayed in the TodoFooterComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage  
  A TodoStorageService is implemented and used by an NgRx Effect (saveTodos$) ensuring that any modifications to the todos are saved in localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization  
  The loadTodos effect retrieves todos from localStorage at application startup and dispatches a loadTodosSuccess action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing  
  The TodoItemComponent listens for the custom "todoEscape" event (provided by the TodoEscapeDirective) and calls onEscape() to revert editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo  
  The custom TodoFocusDirective is used in the TodoItemComponent’s edit input. When the editing state is active (isEditing = true), the directive sets focus on the element.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original  
  The solution includes the TodoMVC CSS files via angular.json, ensuring that the visual styling closely matches the original application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately  
  In both addTodo and doneEditing methods, the code trims the input. An empty title results in no new todo being added or, in editing, the removal of the todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter  
  The feature routing in TodoRoutingModule and the use of routerLink in the footer allow the URL to reflect the current filter ("all", "active", "completed").
