# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed
  
  The code in `Header.tsx` component correctly implements the functionality to create new todos when the Enter key is pressed. The component includes proper event handling with `handleNewTodoKeyDown` function that checks for the ENTER_KEY, prevents default behavior, trims the input value, and calls the `onNewTodo` callback if the value is not empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter
  
  The application correctly displays todos based on the current filter. In the `MainSection.tsx` component, there's a `useMemo` hook that filters todos according to the current filter state ('all', 'active', or 'completed'). The filtered todos are then passed to the `TodoList` component for rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos
  
  The toggle all functionality is correctly implemented. In the `MainSection.tsx`, there's an input with className "toggle-all" that, when changed, calls `handleToggleAll` which dispatches the `toggleAll` action. The Redux slice has a corresponding reducer that sets the completed status of all todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted
  
  The `TodoItem.tsx` component implements all required functionality:
  - Toggle: Through an input checkbox that calls `onToggle` when changed
  - Edit: Through double-clicking the label which calls `handleEdit`
  - Delete: Through a button with className "destroy" that calls `onDestroy`
  
  These actions are properly connected to Redux actions in the `App.tsx` component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode
  
  In the `TodoItem.tsx` component, the label has an `onDoubleClick` handler that calls `handleEdit`, which in turn calls the `onEdit` prop. This prop is connected to a handler in `App.tsx` that dispatches the `setEditingId` action to enable editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo
  
  The `TodoItem.tsx` component includes a `handleKeyDown` function that checks for the ENTER_KEY and calls `handleSubmit` when detected. `handleSubmit` then calls the `onSave` prop with the trimmed edit text.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value
  
  The `handleKeyDown` function in `TodoItem.tsx` also checks for the ESCAPE_KEY. When detected, it resets the edit text to the original todo title and calls the `onCancel` prop, which is connected to a handler that clears the editing state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The `Footer.tsx` component receives a `count` prop representing active todos and displays it with proper pluralization: `<strong>{count}</strong> {activeTodoWord} left`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The `Footer.tsx` component includes a `renderFilterLink` function that creates filter links for All, Active, and Completed filters. These links have proper styling based on the current filter and dispatch actions to change the filter when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos
  
  The `Footer.tsx` component conditionally renders a "Clear completed" button when there are completed todos. This button calls the `onClearCompleted` handler which dispatches the `clearCompleted` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence
  
  The Redux store includes a `localStorageMiddleware` that saves todos to localStorage whenever a todos-related action is dispatched. Additionally, the initial state is loaded from localStorage in the `loadState` function in the todos slice.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state
  
  The application conditionally renders several elements:
  - `MainSection` returns null if there are no todos
  - `Footer` returns null if there are no todos
  - The "Clear completed" button only appears when there are completed todos
  - The todo list only shows todos that match the current filter

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count
  
  The `pluralize` utility function is used in `Footer.tsx` to correctly pluralize 'item' based on the count: `const activeTodoWord = pluralize(count, 'item');`

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components
  
  The application is well-structured with focused components:
  - `App`: Main application container
  - `Header`: Input for new todos
  - `MainSection`: Toggle all checkbox and todo list
  - `TodoList`: Renders the list of todo items
  - `TodoItem`: Individual todo item with toggle, edit, delete functionality
  - `Footer`: Filters, item count, and clear completed button
  
  This structure follows the single responsibility principle and makes the code maintainable.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality
  
  The files are well-organized by functionality:
  - `components/`: UI components
  - `redux/`: State management with store and slice
  - `types/`: TypeScript interfaces and types
  - `utils/`: Utility functions
  - `constants.ts`: Application constants
  
  This organization makes it easy to navigate and maintain the codebase.
