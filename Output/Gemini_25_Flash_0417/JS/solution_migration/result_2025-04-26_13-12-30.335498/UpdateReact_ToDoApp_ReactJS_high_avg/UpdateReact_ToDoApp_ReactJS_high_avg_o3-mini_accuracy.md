# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all React imports use React 18.x compatible syntax  
  All components use the React 18 API (e.g., createRoot) and proper React 18 import conventions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all components use functional component syntax with hooks instead of class components  
  Every component (Header, MainSection, TodoItem, etc.) is implemented as a functional component using hooks like useState, useEffect, useCallback, and useMemo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Redux Toolkit's createSlice is used for state management  
  The Redux slice is defined using createSlice in the file todosSlice.ts, ensuring a modern Redux implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for all props, state, and Redux store  
  Interfaces and types are provided in src/types, covering props, state, action payloads, and Redux store types.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses immutable state updates in reducers  
  The reducers use Immer (provided by Redux Toolkit) for safe mutable-looking but immutable state updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that nanoid is used for ID generation instead of custom UUID implementation  
  The code imports and uses nanoid from 'nanoid' to generate todo IDs.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application uses React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate  
  Several components (e.g., Header, TodoItem, TodoList, MainSection, Footer) are wrapped in React.memo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that useCallback is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders  
  In the main App component, event handlers are memoized using useCallback to maintain referential stability.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage handling is implemented in a modern way  
  LocalStorage persistence is implemented via a Redux middleware in the store configuration, ensuring state is saved after actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows consistent naming conventions throughout the application  
  Variable and function names are consistent and descriptive across all files and modules.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that proper error handling is implemented where necessary  
  Minimal error handling is present (e.g., error logging in localStorage loading and validating the container in index.tsx).  
  Although basic error handling is included, additional error handling could be added in production scenarios. Hence, not a full 100%.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware  
  The Redux store is configured with a custom middleware that persists state to localStorage whenever a todos action is dispatched.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that React.lazy is used for code splitting where appropriate  
  The current implementation does not utilize React.lazy for dynamic imports or code splitting.  
  Although the application is well modularized, React.lazy is not used even where it could improve load performance, which does not meet this evaluation step.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the codebase has no TODOs remaining  
  The code is free of any TODO comments or unfinished markers.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux Provider wraps the application entry point  
  In index.tsx, the application is wrapped with the Provider component from react-redux for proper state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure strict TypeScript type checking is implemented throughout the application  
  The tsconfig.json is set up to enforce strict type checking, and TypeScript interfaces/types are used consistently.
