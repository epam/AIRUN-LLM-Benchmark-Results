# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The Header component’s input correctly checks for the Enter key (using ENTER_KEY) and calls onNewTodo with trimmed input.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The MainSection component filters todos based on the filter prop using useMemo and passes the filtered todos to TodoList.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  The MainSection component includes a checkbox for toggling all todos via the onToggleAll handler which dispatches the toggleAll action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  In the TodoItem component, the onToggle, onEdit, onDestroy, onSave, and onCancel callbacks are implemented properly to manage individual todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  A double-click on the label in TodoItem triggers the onEdit callback, entering editing mode as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  The TodoItem component listens for the ENTER_KEY during editing and calls the submit handler to save changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  The TodoItem component listens for the ESCAPE_KEY during editing, resets the editText to the original title, and calls onCancel.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  The Footer component receives the active todo count and displays it correctly in the todo-count element.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  Filter links for All, Active, and Completed are present in the Footer component with appropriate onClick handlers and classes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  The Footer component conditionally renders a “Clear completed” button when completedCount is greater than 0.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  A middleware in the Redux store configuration saves the todos array to localStorage after every todos-related action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  MainSection and Footer components conditionally render (or hide) based on the number of todos or their completion status.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  The Footer component utilizes the pluralize utility function to display "item" or "items" based on the count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The migration splits the TodoMVC app into focused components (Header, MainSection, TodoList, TodoItem, Footer, App), enhancing the separation of concerns.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The provided project structure organizes components, redux logic, types, utils, and configuration files into separate folders by functionality.
