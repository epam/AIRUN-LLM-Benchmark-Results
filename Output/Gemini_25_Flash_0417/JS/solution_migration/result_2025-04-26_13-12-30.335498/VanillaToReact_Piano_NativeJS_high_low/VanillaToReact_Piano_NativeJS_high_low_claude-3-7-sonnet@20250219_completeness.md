# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'
  
  The provided code includes a `Header.tsx` component that renders a header with the class "header" containing an h1 element with the class "header-title" and text "Virtual Piano". This component is correctly imported and used in the main `App.tsx` component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons
  
  The `ToggleButtonGroup.tsx` component renders a div with class "btn-container" containing two buttons: one with text "Notes" and one with text "Letters". This component is properly integrated in the `App.tsx` component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)
  
  The `Piano.tsx` component correctly renders all piano keys by mapping over two arrays: `pianoKeysData` (for natural keys - C, D, E, F, G, A, B) and `sharpKeysData` (for sharp keys - C♯, D♯, F♯, G♯, A♯, including a placeholder for the missing sharp). These are rendered using the `PianoKey` component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes
  
  In the `PianoKey.tsx` component, data attributes are correctly implemented:
  ```typescript
  const dataAttributes: { [key: string]: string } = {
    'data-note': note,
  };
  if (letter) {
    dataAttributes['data-letter'] = letter;
  }
  ```
  These attributes are spread onto the div element that represents each piano key.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked
  
  The `Piano.tsx` component initializes audio objects for each note in a `useRef` object called `soundMapper`. The `handlePlay` function correctly plays the corresponding audio when a key is clicked by accessing the appropriate audio element from `soundMapper.current[note]`, resetting its position with `currentTime = 0`, and calling `play()`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)
  
  The `PianoKey` component applies a CSS class "piano-key-active" when the key is active based on the `isActive` prop. The active state is tracked in the `Piano` component using the `playedNotes` state array.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes
  
  The `Piano` component includes a `useEffect` hook that adds keyboard event listeners for `keydown` and `keyup` events. These handlers correctly map keyboard keys to piano notes using the `letterToNoteMap` object and call the appropriate functions to play or stop notes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked
  
  The `App` component maintains a `showLetters` state variable that is toggled by the `handleToggle` function when buttons are clicked. This state is passed to the `Piano` component, which then passes it to each `PianoKey` component to determine whether to display notes or letters.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes
  
  The `FullscreenButton` component correctly implements the Fullscreen API, toggling between fullscreen and normal modes when clicked. It includes proper error handling for both entering and exiting fullscreen mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly
  
  The `Piano` component uses a state array `playedNotes` to track multiple active notes simultaneously. The `handlePlay` function adds notes to this array, and `handleResetActive` removes them. This approach correctly supports multiple simultaneous key presses.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys
  
  The `PianoKey` component includes an `onMouseMove` handler that checks if the mouse button is pressed (`event.buttons === 1`) and if the key is not already active, then triggers the `onPlay` function. This correctly implements the drag-to-play functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information
  
  The `Footer.tsx` component renders a footer with a div containing the year "2020", and this component is correctly integrated in the `App.tsx` component.
