# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration  
  The answer shows the creation of the project using Create React App with the TypeScript template and uses React 18’s createRoot API.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure  
  The answer defines a TypeScript interface in the file "types.ts" (i.e. KeyData) and uses a typed Record for the audio mapping (Record<string, HTMLAudioElement>), ensuring type safety.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks  
  All components (Header, Footer, ToggleButtonGroup, FullscreenButton, PianoKey, Piano, App) are built as functional components, and React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useRef) are used throughout.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)  
  The App component manages UI state (e.g., showLetters) using useState, and the Piano component maintains the playedNotes state while using useEffect for lifecycle events such as setting up keyboard listeners.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels  
  Keyboard events are handled in the Piano component via a useEffect that attaches document-level keydown and keyup listeners and properly cleans them up on unmount.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events  
  Mouse event handlers for piano keys are implemented in the PianoKey component using React’s synthetic event system, handling mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, and mousemove events.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment  
  The answer uses a useRef hook to store and initialize Audio objects once in a useEffect hook, ensuring that audio resources are managed correctly and cleaned up on component unmount.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility  
  The FullscreenButton component encapsulates the fullscreen logic with an onClick handler that checks for fullscreen support and handles errors, following React event handling patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns  
  Conditional CSS classes are applied via template literals and array filtering within components such as PianoKey and ToggleButtonGroup, ensuring dynamic styling based on state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate  
  The PianoKey component is wrapped with React.memo to avoid unnecessary re-renders, and useCallback is used to memoize play and reset functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations  
  Audio playback is managed by resetting the currentTime property and calling play() within proper React lifecycle hooks (useEffect), along with cleanup of audio resources on unmount.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application  
  Interfaces and strict type annotations are used throughout components and utility files (e.g., types.ts, component props, event handlers), ensuring type safety across the application.
