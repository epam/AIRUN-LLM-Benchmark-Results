# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'.  
  The provided implementation includes a Header component that returns an h1 element with the text "Virtual Piano", fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons.  
  The ToggleButtonGroup component creates two buttons ("Notes" and "Letters") inside a container with the class "btn-container", which meets the criteria.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys).  
  The Piano component maps over two arrays (pianoKeysData for natural keys and sharpKeysData for sharp keys) and renders them appropriately. This indicates that both types of keys are rendered in the interface.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes.  
  The PianoKey component uses the spread operator to pass a data attributes object (including "data-note" and, when applicable, "data-letter") to the DOM element, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked.  
  The Piano component initializes a soundMapper using useRef to create new Audio objects for all defined notes using the proper file paths. The onMouseDown event in PianoKey calls a handler that plays the appropriate note, ensuring that the correct audio is played when a key is clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed).  
  PianoKey assigns the "piano-key-active" class to the key element when the key is active (as indicated by the isActive prop), allowing for visual highlighting when a key is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes.  
  The Piano component sets up global keyboard event listeners (keydown and keyup) that map keyboard characters to specific notes via the letterToNoteMap, ensuring that pressing the appropriate keys triggers the corresponding note play and reset actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked.  
  The App component maintains a showLetters state that is passed down to both the ToggleButtonGroup and the Piano component; toggling the state updates the display between showing notes or letters accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes.  
  The FullscreenButton component handles the fullscreen toggle using the Fullscreen API with both requestFullscreen and exitFullscreen calls, as well as error handling, to properly switch between fullscreen and normal modes.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly.  
  The Piano component manages active notes in the playedNotes state array, allowing multiple keys to be active at once. While the code is designed for handling multiple simultaneous key presses, the concurrency behavior depends on browser audio handling and the userâ€™s interaction. Confidence is slightly less than 100% because simultaneous sound playback may depend on environmental factors outside of the code itself.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys.  
  The PianoKey component includes an onMouseMove handler that checks if the left mouse button is pressed (event.buttons === 1) and triggers the play action accordingly. This fulfills the requirement of handling mouse drag across keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information.  
  The Footer component renders a footer element containing the year "2020", thereby fulfilling this requirement.
