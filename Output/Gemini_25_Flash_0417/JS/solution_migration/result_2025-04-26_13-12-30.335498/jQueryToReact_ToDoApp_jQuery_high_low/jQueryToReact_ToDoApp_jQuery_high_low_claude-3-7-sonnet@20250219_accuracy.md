# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18.x
  
  The code explicitly references React 18 features, including using `ReactDOM.createRoot` which is specific to React 18.x in `src/index.tsx`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript for type safety
  
  TypeScript is used throughout the codebase with explicit type definitions in files like `src/types/index.ts` and type annotations in all components and functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for state management
  
  Redux Toolkit is properly implemented with `createSlice` in the `src/redux/todosSlice.ts` file, including action creators and reducers.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm nanoid is used for generating unique IDs
  
  The code imports nanoid from 'nanoid' and uses it to generate unique IDs for new todos in the addTodo reducer.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code uses functional components with hooks instead of class components
  
  All components are implemented as functional components using React hooks such as useState, useEffect, useRef, useSelector, and useDispatch.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains the same routing functionality with proper route handling
  
  The application implements React Router with proper routes for '/all', '/active', and '/completed', including a FilterHandler component to handle filter changes based on URL parameters.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Redux store is properly configured with appropriate slices
  
  The Redux store is properly configured in `src/redux/store.ts` with the todos reducer, and the slice is well-structured with all necessary actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the Redux provider is set up in the application entry point
  
  The Redux Provider is correctly set up in `src/index.tsx`, wrapping the App component to provide access to the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for all data structures
  
  Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces are defined in `src/types/index.ts` including Todo, TodoFilter, and TodosState, with proper usage throughout the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows React best practices for component composition
  
  The application follows React best practices with a well-structured component hierarchy and clear separation of concerns between components like TodoApp, Header, Main, TodoList, TodoItem, and Footer.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles keyboard events properly (Enter key for creating/updating todos, Escape key for canceling edits)
  
  Keyboard event handling is properly implemented in the TodoItem and Header components, with Enter for submission and Escape for cancellation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application maintains local storage persistence if implemented
  
  Local storage persistence is well-implemented with loadState and saveState functions in `src/utils/localStorage.ts` and proper integration with the Redux store in `src/index.tsx`.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  The code appears generally free of errors, though there is explicit error logging with console.error in the localStorage utility, which is appropriate for error handling rather than indicating issues with the code itself.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application implements proper error handling
  
  Error handling is implemented throughout the application, particularly in the localStorage utilities where try/catch blocks are used to handle potential errors when parsing or storing data.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm the code is optimized with no unnecessary re-renders
  
  The code follows React best practices to avoid unnecessary re-renders, such as using useSelector to access only the needed parts of the state and implementing effect dependencies properly in useEffect hooks.
