# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos

    The application has a `Header` component that includes an `<h1>todos</h1>` title and an input field with the "new-todo" class for creating new todos. The input includes proper event handling for adding new todos when Enter is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos

    The `Main` component includes a toggle-all checkbox with proper labeling and event handling. It also renders the `TodoList` component which displays the list of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button

    The `TodoItem` component correctly implements all required elements: a toggle checkbox to mark completion status, the todo title display, and a destroy button to delete the todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode

    The `TodoItem` component implements the `handleDoubleClickLabel` function that sets the editing state to true when a user double-clicks the todo label, and includes proper input field for editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)

    The application implements filtering functionality through React Router with routes for "/all", "/active", and "/completed". The `FilterHandler` component dispatches the appropriate filter action based on the URL.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization

    The `Footer` component displays the count of active todos with proper pluralization using the `pluralize` helper function that handles singular vs plural form.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter

    The `Footer` component includes NavLink components for All, Active, and Completed filters that apply a "selected" class to highlight the current filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist

    The `Footer` component conditionally renders a "Clear completed" button when there are completed todos (`completedCount > 0`), with proper event handling to dispatch the `clearCompleted` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter

    The `Header` component handles the `handleNewTodoKeyDown` event which checks for the Enter key and dispatches the `addTodo` action with the trimmed input value.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos

    The `TodoItem` component implements the `handleToggle` function that dispatches the `toggleTodo` action with the todo's ID when the checkbox is clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once

    The `Main` component includes the toggle-all checkbox and implements the `handleToggleAll` function that dispatches the `toggleAll` action with the checked state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management

    The `TodoItem` component uses `useRef` and `useEffect` to properly focus the edit input when entering edit mode, and positions the cursor at the end of the text. It also handles enter, escape, and blur events properly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos

    The `TodoItem` component includes a destroy button with the `handleDelete` function that dispatches the `deleteTodo` action with the todo's ID.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos

    The `Footer` component includes a "Clear completed" button with the `handleClearCompleted` function that dispatches the `clearCompleted` action when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status

    The `TodoList` component uses the `selectFilteredTodos` selector function to filter todos based on the current filter state ('all', 'active', or 'completed').
