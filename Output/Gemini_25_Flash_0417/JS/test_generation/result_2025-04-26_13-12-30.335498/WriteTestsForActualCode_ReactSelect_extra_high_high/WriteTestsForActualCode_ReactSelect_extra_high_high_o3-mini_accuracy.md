# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up in the test file.  
  The test file imports from "@testing-library/react", "@testing-library/user-event", and "@testing-library/jest-dom", and the configuration for jsdom is correctly set up via mocks and Jest configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test cases are properly isolated and do not have interdependencies.  
  Each suite uses proper beforeEach/afterEach cleanup with jest.clearAllMocks() and resets for document event listeners and mocks, ensuring isolation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that DOM events are simulated using proper React Testing Library methods.  
  The tests consistently use userEvent and fireEvent to simulate clicks, keyboard events, touch events, and composition events.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that accessibility attributes are being tested appropriately.  
  The tests check ARIA attributes on the input and menu components (e.g., aria-expanded, aria-activedescendant, role, aria-controls) ensuring accessibility requirements are met.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure mocks are used for external dependencies where appropriate.  
  Extensive mocks are provided for modules (e.g., Menu, LiveRegion, filters, internal components, and utilities), isolating the Select component's logic from external dependencies.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of async/await for asynchronous testing where needed.  
  The tests use waitFor to wait for asynchronous UI updates from state changes and event handling appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all assertions use appropriate Jest matchers.  
  The assertions use matchers like toHaveBeenCalledWith, toHaveFocus, toBeVisible, toBeInTheDocument, and style-based assertions, all of which are appropriate and standard in Jest.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that tests include proper cleanup after each test case.  
  The use of beforeEach/reset of mocks and clearing of document event listeners provides proper cleanup after each test case.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test descriptions clearly indicate what functionality is being tested.  
  The use of descriptive describe and it blocks makes it clear which aspect (e.g., rendering, user interactions, state management, accessibility, edge cases) of the Select component is being tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the test file follows best practices for organizing test cases (describe/it blocks).  
  The test file is well-organized into logical sections with nested describe blocks corresponding to different functionality areas.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that all event handlers are tested using appropriate simulation methods.  
  The tests simulate mouse, keyboard, focus/blur, and touch events using appropriate methods, ensuring event handlers are properly exercised.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the test environment correctly simulates both mouse and keyboard interactions.  
  Mouse events (click, mouseDown) and keyboard events (via userEvent.keyboard and fireEvent.keyDown) are simulated, covering interactive behavior appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for touch events properly simulate mobile interactions.  
  The tests explicitly check for touch events by using fireEvent.touchEnd and by mocking isTouchCapable to simulate a mobile environment.
