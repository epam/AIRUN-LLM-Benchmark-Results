# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist  
  The tests include scenarios for rendering with default props, placeholders, and proper DOM elements (e.g., SelectContainer, Control, Input, Placeholder) ensuring the component renders as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (Arrow keys, Tab, Enter, Escape) are present  
  Multiple tests cover keyboard events such as ArrowDown, ArrowUp, Enter, Escape, Space, Tab, PageUp/PageDown, Home/End and verify that the correct option is focused or selected.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)  
  The test suite includes tests for mouse clicks on the control, dropdown indicator, clear indicator, and option hover events, which confirm that mouse interactions work as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior  
  Tests verify state updates by simulating onChange events, providing value props (controlled), handling null/undefined values, and checking the rendered output accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values  
  The tests include cases for single- and multi-select behavior, removal of multi-values via backspace or clicking on the remove icon, and clearing values with the clear indicator.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented  
  There are dedicated tests that simulate opening the menu (e.g., on control click, dropdown indicator click, keyboard interactions) and closing it (e.g., clicking again, Escape key, blur events, document scroll events).

- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality  
  Tests verify that options are filtered based on user input, that a custom filter function can be provided, and that the menu reflects the filtered options correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist  
  The test suite includes rendering multiple selected values, testing multi-selection state changes, and verifying proper handling of value removals and focus transitions in multi-select mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility  
  Accessibility tests confirm that appropriate ARIA roles, states, properties (e.g., aria-expanded, aria-activedescendant, aria-haspopup) and live region announcements are correctly set.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested  
  Edge cases such as empty options arrays, rendering a custom noOptionsMessage, and handling null/undefined value props are all covered by the tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states  
  There are tests for handling the isLoading property, rendering a loading indicator, and displaying custom loading messages.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states  
  Several tests check that when the component is disabled, the input is disabled, proper CSS classes are applied, and disabled options cannot be selected.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance  
  The test suite includes a scenario with 20 options and tests for page navigation (PageUp/PageDown) to simulate and verify behavior on larger sets.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested  
  Multiple tests verify focus transitions on input, control, options, and even multi-select value focus management (hiding/showing the input when values are focused).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering  
  Dedicated tests ensure that when values are selected the placeholder is removed and that the selected options are rendered correctly for both single and multiple selections.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations  
  There is a test verifying that a custom formatOptionLabel prop function is called correctly with both 'menu' and 'value' contexts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)  
  The tests employ mock functions for onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose, and similar callbacks to ensure they are called with the correct arguments during interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)  
  The tests verify that indicator components such as DropdownIndicator, ClearIndicator, and LoadingIndicator are rendered (or not rendered) appropriately depending on the props and the interaction state.
