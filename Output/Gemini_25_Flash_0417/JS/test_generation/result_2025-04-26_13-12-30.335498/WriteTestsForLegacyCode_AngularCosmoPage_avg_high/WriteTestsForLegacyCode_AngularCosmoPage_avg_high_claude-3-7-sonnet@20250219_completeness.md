# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources
  
  The submitted test suite includes comprehensive tests for the REST factory in the `rest.spec.js` file. The tests verify that all 16 resources are properly defined and configured with the correct URLs, parameters, and actions. There's a specific test to check that `$resource` is called with the correct parameters for each endpoint.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly
  
  The `page.spec.js` test file thoroughly verifies that all properties of the Page factory initialize with the correct default values. The test specifically checks that `id`, `title`, `description`, `header`, `subheader`, `body`, `url`, `type`, `published`, `published_date`, `themePages`, `timestamp`, `extras`, and `misc` properties are all initialized with their expected values.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly
  
  The `users.spec.js` test file verifies that all properties of the Users factory initialize correctly. The test checks that `id`, `username`, `name`, `bio`, `email`, `facebook`, `twitter`, `photo`, and `role` properties are all initialized with their expected default values.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods
  
  The `pageCtrl.spec.js` file includes comprehensive tests for all public methods of the controller, including `localVersion()`, `deleteNewerVersion()`, `saveLocal()`, `deletePage()`, `updatePageType()`, `titleChange()`, `descriptionChange()`, `urlChange()`, `autocompleteTags()`, `selectSuggestion()`, and `savePage()`. Each method's functionality is thoroughly tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller
  
  The test suite contains a dedicated "Initialization" section that thoroughly tests all aspects of page initialization in the controller, including setting properties from the Page factory, handling schedule dates, handling page types based on available theme pages, and checking localStorage for newer versions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation
  
  The test suite includes specific tests for the `titleChange()` function that verify URL auto-generation logic. It tests various conditions: when URL is "/new", when URL is "new", when URL is empty, when autoURL is true, and when autoURL is false. It also verifies that punctuation and spaces are handled correctly in the auto-generated URL.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction
  
  The test suite includes tests for the `saveLocal()` function that verify it properly updates Page factory properties from the scope and correctly saves specific properties to localStorage. The tests use a mock localStorage implementation with spies to verify the correct interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality
  
  The test suite includes a dedicated section for "Tag Autocomplete" that tests the `autocompleteTags()` function. It verifies that the function queries the REST API with the last tag, sets suggestions on a successful query, handles query errors, and properly handles cases where the tags array is empty or the last tag is empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)
  
  The test suite has extensive tests for the `savePage()` function covering all conditional branches. It is divided into sections for validation, new page/duplicate flow, and update existing page flow. The tests cover error cases (duplicate URLs, missing types, empty URLs), title fallbacks, schedule date logic, featured image handling, and all API interactions for creating, updating, and saving related data.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types
  
  The test suite includes specific tests for edge cases like empty URLs, invalid URLs (e.g., "new"), missing page types, and handling of localStorage data. It verifies that appropriate error messages are broadcast when these conditions occur.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly
  
  The "Delete Page Tests" section thoroughly tests the `deletePage()` function, verifying that it calls the correct REST delete methods for content, revisions, extras, and tags. It also tests success notifications, redirection after deletion, and error handling when content delete fails.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions
  
  The test suite includes a dedicated "Local Storage / Version Management" section that tests the `localVersion()`, `deleteNewerVersion()`, and `saveLocal()` functions. It verifies that these functions correctly handle localStorage interactions, restore data from localStorage, clear items from localStorage, and set the newerVersion flag appropriately.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components
  
  The test suite appears to be extremely comprehensive, covering all components and functions thoroughly. While the actual coverage metrics aren't provided in the submission, the test cases are detailed enough to suggest very high coverage, likely well above 80%. The tests cover initialization paths, error paths, success paths, and edge cases for all components. The only minor uncertainty is around some of the more complex nested conditions in the `savePage()` function, but extensive test cases are provided for various branches.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling
  
  The test suite verifies proper event broadcasting and handling throughout. It checks that events like "contentGet", "settingsGet", "notify", "saved", "page_created", and "page_updated" are broadcast at the appropriate times and with the correct parameters. It also tests that the controller properly responds to events like "contentGet".

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality
  
  The test suite includes specific tests for date handling and scheduling functionality. It verifies that scheduled dates are correctly processed, timestamps are properly handled, and the publish status is updated based on whether the scheduled date is in the past or future. The tests cover all the different scenarios for date handling in the `savePage()` function.
