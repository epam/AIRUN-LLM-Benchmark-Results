# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering  
  The tests in app.test.tsx contain several cases (e.g., checking the header, new todo input, and overall layout) that confirm the component is rendered correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos  
  There is a test ("should call model.addTodo and clear input on Enter keydown in new todo input with value") that verifies adding a new todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos  
  The test ("should call model.toggleAll when toggle-all checkbox is clicked") checks that the toggle-all functionality is triggered correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos  
  Tests are provided that examine the filtering behavior by asserting the correct props are passed to TodoItem components under different filtering states.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The test verifies that when the clear completed button is clicked, the modelâ€™s clearCompleted method is called.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering  
  Multiple tests check the default, completed, and editing states, ensuring that the component renders as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos  
  The tests simulate toggling (using onToggle), destroying (using onDestroy), and editing (using onEdit) via double-click and button clicks.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events  
  There are tests for Enter and Escape key events in the edit input, confirming correct propagation of onSave, onDestroy, and onCancel callbacks.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts  
  Tests check that the footer displays correct text based on the count (both singular and plural forms).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation  
  Tests confirm that filter links receive the "selected" class appropriately based on the nowShowing prop.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The "Clear completed" button is rendered under the right conditions and clicking it triggers the onClearCompleted callback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos  
  The provided tests cover addTodo, toggle, save, destroy and toggleAll functionalities of the model.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions  
  There is a dedicated test which subscribes and then verifies that inform calls the subscriber as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  Tests ensure that clearCompleted functions correctly, removing completed todos while keeping active ones.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation  
  Multiple tests exist to check that uuid returns a string, matches the typical UUID format, and provides distinct values on subsequent calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality  
  The pluralize function is tested with multiple scenarios (count equal to 1 vs. counts other than 1).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations  
  The tests cover storing data into localStorage, retrieving data, handling missing or invalid JSON, which confirms correct store behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function  
  Tests show that extend merges multiple objects as expected, handling property conflicts and empty objects appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx  
  The tests for components (app, footer, todoItem) use the .test.tsx suffix, and tests for utilities and models use .test.ts, which is an accepted convention in TypeScript projects for non-JSX modules.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data  
  Sample todo objects are defined in multiple test files and used consistently across tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented  
  The app.test.tsx file includes tests that verify Router initialization, its route callbacks, and proper setState usage when routes are activated.
