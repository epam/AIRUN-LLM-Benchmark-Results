  - Issue 7.1 and 7.2 cover form submission error handling
  - Issue 9.1 and 9.2 specifically focus on API error handling
  - The analysis recommends using SubmissionError from redux-form for proper error propagation

- **Pass** (100%): Verify state management for form data is properly analyzed
  
  The review properly analyzes form state management:
  - Issue 2.2 addresses the transition from class components to functional components with hooks
  - Issue 5.1 covers the outdated redux-form API and recommends using the Field component
  - The review recognizes the app is using older redux-form versions and suggests modernization

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm component structure and responsibilities are evaluated
  
  Component structure is thoroughly evaluated:
  - Issue 2.3 analyzes the tight coupling between FormGroup and redux-form
  - Issue 8.1 specifically addresses the Signup component mixing multiple concerns
  - Issue 8.2 evaluates FormGroup as a generic wrapper
  - The analysis recommends modern functional component architecture with proper separation of concerns

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure prop usage and component interfaces are reviewed
  
  Prop usage and component interfaces are well-reviewed:
  - Issue 2.1 addresses outdated PropTypes usage
  - Issue 2.3 discusses better interface design for FormGroup
  - Issue 4.1 covers accessibility props like aria-label and htmlFor
  - The analysis provides specific recommendations for prop interfaces in multiple components

- **Pass** (100%): Verify component lifecycle management is analyzed
  
  Component lifecycle management is analyzed:
  - Issue 2.2 addresses the transition from class component lifecycle to hooks
  - Issue 3.1 discusses function binding in render vs. constructor or using useCallback
  - The analysis recommends useCallback for event handlers in functional components

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm API call patterns and error handling are evaluated
  
  API call patterns are thoroughly evaluated:
  - Issue 7.1 addresses manual Promise wrapping in handleSubmit
  - Issue 9.1 and 9.2 specifically focus on API integration and error handling
  - The analysis recommends modern async/await patterns and proper error handling for API calls

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure promise handling and asynchronous operations are assessed
  
  Promise handling is comprehensively assessed:
  - Issue 1.2 addresses Promise chaining in asyncValidate
  - Issue 7.1 covers Promise management in form submission
  - Issue 9.1 and 9.2 discuss Promise handling for API calls
  - The analysis provides specific improvements for each asynchronous operation

- **Pass** (100%): Verify specific code examples are provided for suggested improvements
  
  The review provides specific code examples for every suggested improvement:
  - Each issue includes a "Corrected Implementation" section with detailed code examples
  - The examples show both the problematic code and the corrected version
  - The code examples are comprehensive and include comments explaining the changes

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm issues are properly categorized by technical aspect
  
  Issues are clearly categorized by technical aspect:
  - The review is organized into 9 main categories (Readability, Maintainability, Performance, etc.)
  - Each category contains specific issues that are numbered (e.g., Issue 2.1, Issue 2.2)
  - The categorization is logical and helps organize the feedback effectively

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure before/after code examples demonstrate clear improvements
  
  The before/after code examples clearly demonstrate improvements:
  - Each issue presents the problematic code first, followed by a detailed explanation
  - The corrected implementation demonstrates clear improvements with modern patterns
  - Many examples include comments explaining why the new code is better
  - The review provides both incremental improvements and larger architectural changes
