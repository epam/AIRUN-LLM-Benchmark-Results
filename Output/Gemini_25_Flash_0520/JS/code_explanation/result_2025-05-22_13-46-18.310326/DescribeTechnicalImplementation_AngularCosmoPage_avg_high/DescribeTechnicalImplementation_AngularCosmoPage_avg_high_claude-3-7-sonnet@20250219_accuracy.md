# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies Angular.js as the framework used
  
  The documentation consistently and correctly identifies Angular.js as the framework throughout the document. It accurately refers to Angular.js-specific concepts like factories, controllers, and services.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all factories (REST, Page, Users) are accurately documented with their purposes
  
  All three factories are thoroughly documented with their purposes clearly explained:
  - REST Factory: Described as "a foundational service responsible for abstracting interactions with the backend RESTful API"
  - Page Factory: Described as "a data factory acting as a global singleton to store and manage the state of the currently edited page"
  - Users Factory: Described as a service that "holds global information about the currently authenticated user"

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of the Page controller and its functionality is technically accurate
  
  The documentation accurately describes pageCtrl as "the central logic unit that orchestrates the page editing process." The detailed explanation of its functionality, including binding data, handling interactions, validation, and API communication, is technically accurate.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the RESTful API endpoints are correctly documented
  
  The document provides a comprehensive list of all RESTful API endpoints in section 3.1, including their URL patterns, default parameters, and custom methods. All endpoints like blocks, comments, content, contentExtras, etc. are correctly documented.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of Angular module dependencies ($resource, $location, etc.) is correct
  
  The document correctly explains Angular dependencies throughout, especially in sections detailing technical implementations. It accurately describes how $resource is used for API interactions, $location for routing, $routeParams for URL parameters, and $rootScope for broadcasts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the page management features (creating, editing, deleting) are accurately described
  
  The document thoroughly and accurately describes all page management features in sections 2.4 and 4.3, including detailed explanations of creating new pages, editing existing ones, duplicating pages, and deleting pages.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately explains how the local storage mechanism works
  
  The documentation accurately explains the local storage mechanism in section 2.4.2 "Unsaved Changes Detection and Recovery," detailing how the controller checks localStorage for specific page properties, how data is stored and retrieved, and the user options to recover or discard changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of form validation logic is technically accurate
  
  The form validation logic is accurately described, particularly in section 4.4.1 where it explains how the savePage function validates inputs before submission, and how validation errors are handled and displayed to the user.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of publish/schedule date handling is correct
  
  The publish/schedule date handling is correctly explained in section 2.4.8, including the radio button options ('Y', 'N', 'schedule'), the conditional datetime input, and how published_date is calculated differently based on the selected publish option.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the tag management and autocomplete feature explanation is technically accurate
  
  The tag management and autocomplete feature is accurately described in section 2.4.6, including how the autocompleteTags() function queries the backend, how suggestions are populated and displayed, and how selectSuggestion(tag) handles user selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the relationship between controllers, factories, and templates is accurately explained
  
  The document clearly explains how controllers, factories, and templates interact. It details how the pageCtrl controller injects and uses the Page, Users, and REST factories, how data binds between the controller and template, and how events are broadcast between components.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation correctly identifies and explains the purpose of broadcast events
  
  The documentation correctly identifies and explains broadcast events throughout, particularly in sections 2.4.1 and 2.4.7, detailing how $scope.$on('contentGet', ...) listens for events and how events like 'notify' and 'settingsGet' are broadcast to communicate between components.
