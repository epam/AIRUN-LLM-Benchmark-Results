# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies Angular.js as the framework used  
  The documentation clearly refers to Angular.js components such as controllers, factories, and the usage of directives like ng-controller, ng-model, and ng-show, which are specific to Angular.js.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all factories (REST, Page, Users) are accurately documented with their purposes  
  The report thoroughly explains that the REST factory handles API interactions, the Page factory serves as a singleton for page data, and the Users factory manages user-specific data.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of the Page controller and its functionality is technically accurate  
  The document provides a detailed explanation of pageCtrlâ€™s responsibilities, including data binding, local storage management, unsaved changes detection, and CRUD operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the RESTful API endpoints are correctly documented  
  All endpoints (e.g., api/blocks/:blockID, api/content/:contentID, etc.) and their configurations are listed accurately, including their custom methods such as the PUT update.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of Angular module dependencies ($resource, $location, etc.) is correct  
  The explanation properly notes the use of dependencies such as ngResource for $resource, $location for routing, $translate for internationalization, and others.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the page management features (creating, editing, deleting) are accurately described  
  The documentation outlines all operations related to page creation, editing, duplication, and deletion clearly, with appropriate technical details and workflow.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately explains how the local storage mechanism works  
  The description of how unsaved changes are detected, stored, and recovered using localStorage is detailed and in line with common Angular.js practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of form validation logic is technically accurate  
  The steps mention validations for duplicate URLs, checking for required fields such as page type and URL, and indicate proper error handling using $rootScope.$broadcast events.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of publish/schedule date handling is correct  
  The report correctly details the logic for setting published dates based on the selected publish status, including the use of immediate or scheduled timestamps.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the tag management and autocomplete feature explanation is technically accurate  
  The documentation explains the use of ng-list, the autocomplete function querying the backend via REST.contentTags.query, and the dynamic replacement of tag fragments clearly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the relationship between controllers, factories, and templates is accurately explained  
  The connection between pageCtrl, the various factories (Page, Users, REST), and the view (page.html) is well described, showing how data flows and how components interact.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation correctly identifies and explains the purpose of broadcast events  
  The report accurately covers the use of $rootScope.$broadcast for notifications, live updates, and inter-component communication, which is essential for an Angular.js application.
