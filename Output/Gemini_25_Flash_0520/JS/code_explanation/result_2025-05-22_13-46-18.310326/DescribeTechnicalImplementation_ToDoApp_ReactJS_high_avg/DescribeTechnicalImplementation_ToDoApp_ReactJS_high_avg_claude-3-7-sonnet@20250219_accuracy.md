- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component's state management approach is accurately documented
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that sample code snippets demonstrate proper implementation of the components
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation explains all ARIA roles and attributes implemented in the components
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation describes how the components support assistive technologies
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that keyboard navigation support and focus management are explained in the documentation
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that performance optimizations like shouldComponentUpdate are documented with explanations
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that component lifecycle methods are explained with their purposes
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that any dependencies or requirements are noted in the documentation
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation uses clear section headings and consistent formatting
  
- **Fail** (100%): Verify that tables are used for structured data like props

    The documentation presents props and their details in a well-structured format with clear headings, types, and descriptions, but doesn't use actual HTML or Markdown tables to organize this information. Instead, it uses nested lists with bold formatting. While this approach is readable and organized, it doesn't strictly follow the requirement to use tables for structured data like props.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all technical terms are used accurately throughout the documentation
