# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x
  
  The code clearly uses React 18.x features, as evidenced by the import statements and the use of modern React hooks like `useState`, `useRef`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, and `useMemo`. The component is implemented as a functional component with the React.FC type from TypeScript, which is consistent with React 18.x patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
  
  The code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions. The component has a dedicated `types.ts` file that defines interfaces for `Option` and `SearchableSelectProps`. All functions and variables have appropriate type annotations, including event handlers and refs.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling
  
  The solution includes a comprehensive `index.css` file that contains all the styling rules for the component. This file is properly imported into the component using `import './index.css'`.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments
  
  The code is clean, well-organized, and free of TODO comments. It follows a logical structure with proper separation of concerns. All functionality is implemented without placeholders or incomplete sections.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility
  
  The component properly uses React's state management hooks for tracking:
  - `isOpen` state for dropdown visibility
  - `searchTerm` for the current search input
  - `activeOption` for the currently highlighted option during keyboard navigation
  All state updates are handled correctly with appropriate callbacks and effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props
  
  The component accepts customizable props through the `SearchableSelectProps` interface, including:
  - `options`: Array of selectable options
  - `value`: Currently selected option
  - `onChange`: Callback for selection changes
  - `placeholder`: Customizable placeholder text (with default value)
  This design makes the component highly reusable across different contexts.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection
  
  The component has comprehensive keyboard support implemented in the `handleKeyDown` function, including:
  - Enter for selection/opening
  - Escape for closing
  - Arrow Up/Down for navigation
  - Tab for focus management
  - Character keys for opening and searching
  The implementation handles all edge cases and follows accessibility best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions
  
  The component uses React's `useRef` appropriately for:
  - `containerRef` for tracking the component container
  - `inputRef` for managing focus on the input element
  - `listboxRef` for scrolling active options into view
  DOM interactions are properly isolated, and direct DOM manipulation is minimized and used only when necessary.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques
  
  The component handles focus correctly by:
  - Returning focus to the input after selection
  - Using `aria-activedescendant` for indicating active options
  - Properly scrolling active options into view
  - Handling focus when clicking outside the component
  Focus is managed in a way that creates a smooth, accessible user experience.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
  
  The component uses comprehensive ARIA attributes:
  - `role="combobox"`, `aria-haspopup="listbox"`, `aria-expanded` on the container
  - `aria-controls`, `aria-activedescendant` for relationship management
  - `role="listbox"` on the dropdown
  - `role="option"`, `aria-selected`, unique IDs on the options
  This implementation follows WAI-ARIA authoring practices for combobox components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  The provided code doesn't contain any patterns that would generate console errors or warnings. It properly handles all edge cases, prevents memory leaks by cleaning up event listeners, and uses React hooks according to the rules of hooks.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component
  
  The component optimizes rendering by:
  - Using `useMemo` for filtering options and computing display values
  - Using `useCallback` for event handlers
  - Structuring dependencies arrays properly in hooks
  - Only updating state when necessary
  These optimizations prevent unnecessary re-renders and maintain good performance.
