The solution provides a comprehensive implementation of a searchable select component with all the required functionality:

1. It renders a dropdown select UI with proper styling and accessibility attributes
2. It includes a search input that filters options as users type
3. It supports single-item selection through both mouse clicks and keyboard navigation
4. It implements complete keyboard navigation using arrow keys with visual indication of the currently focused option
5. It properly handles Enter key for both opening the dropdown and selecting items
6. It manages focus correctly, returning focus to the input when the dropdown closes
7. It closes the dropdown appropriately in all required scenarios (item selection, Escape key, outside clicks)
8. It correctly toggles dropdown visibility with Enter when the component is focused

The implementation includes proper TypeScript typing, ARIA attributes for accessibility, and comprehensive event handling for all required interactions.
