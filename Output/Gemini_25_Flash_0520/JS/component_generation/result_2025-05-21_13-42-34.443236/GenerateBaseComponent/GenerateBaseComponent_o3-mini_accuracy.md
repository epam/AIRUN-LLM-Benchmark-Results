# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  The component uses functional components and React Hooks typical of React 18.x implementations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  All files have .ts/.tsx extensions, and the code defines type interfaces (e.g., Option, SearchableSelectProps) correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  The project structure includes an "index.css" file within the component directory that provides all the styling.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  The code is well-organized, commented, and there are no leftover TODO comments, which indicates production-readiness.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  The component manages state (such as isOpen, searchTerm, activeOption) with Reactâ€™s useState and optimizes performance with useMemo and useCallback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  The component accepts a set of customizable props (options, value, onChange, placeholder), ensuring its reusability in different contexts.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  The implementation handles Enter, Escape, ArrowUp, ArrowDown, and Tab keys to allow intuitive keyboard navigation and selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  The use of refs (containerRef, inputRef, listboxRef) to handle focus and event detection follows React best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  Focus is managed effectively: the input field regains focus after interactions (e.g., selection and closing the dropdown), ensuring a smooth user experience.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  The component includes proper ARIA attributes such as role="combobox", aria-haspopup, aria-expanded, aria-controls, aria-activedescendant, and role="option" to ensure accessibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  The code is clean and well-structured, and there are no obvious red flags that would trigger console errors or warnings under normal use.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  The use of useMemo and useCallback, along with proper dependency management, minimizes unnecessary re-renders, ensuring efficient performance.
