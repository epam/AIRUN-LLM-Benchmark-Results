# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component renders a container with an input field and conditionally a list element (dropdown) when open.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  The component consistently renders an input element that both displays the selected value and allows for search filtering.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The implementation uses a single value state (value: Option | null) and handles selection accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The code supports ArrowUp and ArrowDown keys to navigate through the filtered options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  The Enter key is handled to select the currently active option or the first filtered option if none is active.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  Pressing Enter toggles the dropdown (opening it if closed and vice versa), as seen in the keydown handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  The implementation explicitly invokes inputRef.current?.focus() after closing the dropdown, ensuring focus returns.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  The onClick event on each list item calls the selectOption function, which closes the dropdown and resets the search term.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  When an option is selected with the Enter key, the dropdown is closed (setIsOpen(false)) by the selectOption function.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  The keydown handler listens for the Escape key and properly closes the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  An effect adds an event listener to detect clicks outside the component which closes the dropdown accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  When the component is focused and the dropdown is closed, pressing Enter opens it and sets the search term for further interaction.
