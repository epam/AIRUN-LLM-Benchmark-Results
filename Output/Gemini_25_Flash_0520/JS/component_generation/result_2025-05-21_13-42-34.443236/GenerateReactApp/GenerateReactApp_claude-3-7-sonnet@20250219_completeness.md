# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
    
    The application fetches character data from the SWAPI API using axios in the `fetchCharacters` function and displays the results in a list. The component uses `useEffect` to trigger the API call on mount and stores the results in the `characters` state variable.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
    
    The application properly implements a loading state with the `loading` state variable that is set to `true` before the API call and `false` after it completes. During loading, it displays a "Loading characters..." message with the `loading-message` CSS class for styling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
    
    The application maps over the entire `characters` array in the JSX and renders each character's name in a list item. The mapping function doesn't filter or exclude any characters from the results.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
    
    The solution does not implement any search functionality or input fields. It only fetches and displays a static list of characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
    
    Each character is displayed in a list item that shows the character's name. The code maps over the `characters` array and uses `character.name` to display the name.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
    
    The implementation begins with instructions to create the project using Create React App with TypeScript template: `npx create-react-app swapi-characters-app --template typescript`. The file structure and configuration (`package.json`) are consistent with Create React App.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
    
    The application uses React's `useState` hook to manage three state variables:
    - `characters`: Stores the array of characters fetched from the API
    - `loading`: Tracks whether the data is being fetched
    - `error`: Captures any error messages during fetching
    
    These states are properly maintained throughout the component lifecycle and used to conditionally render UI elements.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
    
    Each character list item uses `character.url` as a unique key:
    ```jsx
    <li key={character.url} className="character-item">
    ```
    The code even includes a comment explaining that the URL is chosen because it's guaranteed to be unique for each character.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
    
    The application has conditional rendering for empty states:
    ```jsx
    {!loading && !error && characters.length === 0 && (
      <p>No characters found.</p>
    )}
    ```
    This ensures users see appropriate feedback when no data is available.
