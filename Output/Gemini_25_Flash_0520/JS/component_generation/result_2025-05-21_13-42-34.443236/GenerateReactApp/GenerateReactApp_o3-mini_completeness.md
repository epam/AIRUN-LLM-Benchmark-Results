# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The App component calls fetchCharacters from the API service and uses the returned data to display a list of characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The code conditionally renders a "Loading characters..." message when the loading state is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  The UI iterates over the characters array and displays each character's name, ensuring all fetched characters are shown.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  The provided implementation focuses solely on fetching and displaying data, with no search bar or input elements included.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each list item in the character list displays the character's name, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The instructions indicate that the project is initialized with Create React App using the TypeScript template.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The App component uses Reactâ€™s useState and useEffect hooks to manage loading, error, and characters data states.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  The code displays each character list item with a unique key using character.url, which ensures optimal rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  The UI accounts for an empty data state by displaying a "No characters found." message when characters.length is 0 and no error exists.
