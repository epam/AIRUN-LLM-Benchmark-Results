# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name

    The solution includes an input field with the appropriate placeholder "Search characters by name..." and the necessary state management with `searchTerm` state variable and `handleSearchChange` event handler.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests

    The solution properly implements a loading indicator using the `loading` state variable that displays "Loading..." text while fetching data from the API. This is shown both during initial load and subsequent searches.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query

    The component loads data on mount through the useEffect hook with the debounced search function. When the component first mounts, `searchTerm` is an empty string, which will trigger the initial data load with an empty search query.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type

    The solution implements a debounced search mechanism using `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout` within a `useEffect` hook that depends on `searchTerm`. This ensures that search results update dynamically after the user pauses typing (500ms debounce delay).

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found

    There is appropriate visual feedback when no results are found with the conditional rendering: `{!loading && !error && characters.length === 0 && (<div style={{ textAlign: 'center', color: '#777' }}>No characters found.</div>)}`

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design

    The solution implements responsive design with appropriate styling, including:
    - Using relative units and percentages
    - Setting max-width and centering elements
    - Using box-sizing: border-box for the input field
    - Styling that adapts to different screen sizes

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response

    The solution correctly displays the character list after receiving the API response. It maps through the characters array and displays each character's name in a styled list item.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed

    The solution implements error handling using try-catch blocks in the API request function. It sets an error state that displays a user-friendly error message when API requests fail, and clears previous errors before new requests.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props

    The solution defines appropriate TypeScript interfaces, including:
    - `Character` interface for character data
    - `SwapiPeopleResponse` interface for the API response structure
    - Proper type annotations for all state variables, references, and function parameters

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities

    The solution maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities. It still displays the list of characters, but now includes the search functionality with proper debouncing, error handling, and user feedback.
