# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type  
  The input field uses an onChange handler (handleSearchChange) that correctly updates the searchTerm state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls  
  The code uses setTimeout with a 500ms delay in a useEffect hook and clears previous timeouts, ensuring debounced API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured  
  Axios is appropriately imported and used with axios.get to fetch data from SWAPI's people endpoint.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses  
  Interfaces (Character and SwapiPeopleResponse), state declarations, and useRef are properly typed.  
  (Note: The use of NodeJS.Timeout in a browser environment might sometimes require a different type, such as number, but this pattern is acceptable in many TS setups.)

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters  
  The endpoint dynamically includes the query parameter when a search term is provided, ensuring correct URL formation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate  
  The fetchCharacters function is wrapped in useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-creations, which is a correct optimization approach.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback  
  A try-catch block is implemented with error state updates and user feedback via an error message in the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing  
  The debouncing pattern ensures that the API call (via fetchCharacters) is executed only after the user pauses typing for 500ms.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices  
  The component uses the useState hook for managing search input, loading state, error messages, and fetched results, which is in line with React conventions.

- **Pass** (95%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code  
  The code is clean with all imports utilized, and there is no extraneous or commented-out code.  
  (Note: A console.error is used for error logging, which is acceptable and expected for error troubleshooting.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests  
  The loading state is set to true before an API request and reset to false in the finally block, ensuring correct UI feedback.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns  
  The component is designed as a functional component using hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, useCallback), which is consistent with current React best practices.
