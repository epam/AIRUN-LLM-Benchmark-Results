# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The component includes an <input type="text" /> element with a value bound to the state variable "searchTerm" and an onChange handler ("handleSearchChange"). This allows users to input their search term, which is later used to filter the characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  The code uses a "loading" state variable and conditionally renders a "Loading..." message when true, ensuring that users are informed while data is being fetched.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  The "searchTerm" state variable is initialized as an empty string, and the effect defined in useEffect triggers the fetchCharacters function with an empty query on component mount, resulting in the initial fetch of all characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  Since the searchTerm state is monitored via a useEffect hook with debouncing, any change in the input field triggers a new API request after 500ms, thus dynamically updating the displayed character results.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  The component conditionally renders a "No characters found." message (when not loading, no error, and the characters array is empty), thereby informing the user when no matching results exist.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  Inline styles (e.g., a max-width, margin, padding, and box-sizing) are applied to the container, suggesting that the component is designed to be responsive. Although these styles provide good basic responsiveness, a more robust responsive design might involve additional media queries or CSS frameworks.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  When characters are successfully fetched (and the loading and error states are false), the component maps over the characters array and displays them in an unordered list, ensuring that search results are shown to the user.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  The asynchronous function (fetchCharacters) includes a try-catch block to handle API errors, setting an error state and displaying an error message to the user when necessary.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The provided code defines TypeScript interfaces for "Character" and "SwapiPeopleResponse". The component is typed as a React.FC, which adequately covers the componentâ€™s props and state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The implementation incorporates additional search functionality, debouncing, and error handling while still fetching and displaying the list of characters as per the original logic, thus maintaining baseline functionality.
