# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies the application as an Angular.js application for web content management
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately describes the REST factory for backend communication
  
- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation correctly explains the Page factory for storing global page variables
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately describes the Users factory for storing current user data
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation correctly explains the page controller functionality
  
- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation accurately explains the page creation and editing process
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately describes the local storage recovery mechanism for unsaved changes
  
- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the documentation correctly explains the version comparison and management features
  
  The documentation mentions "version comparison" features and notes that there's a "compare" button for the newer version banner, but also acknowledges that "compare" and "use" both call the same `localVersion()` function. The documentation correctly identifies that the application supports versioning through revisions but notes that the UI for comparison isn't shown in the code provided. This assessment is accurate but slightly uncertain without seeing the full implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation accurately describes the page deletion workflow
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately explains the auto-URL generation from title functionality
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation correctly describes the tag autocompletion and suggestion system
  
- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation accurately explains the publication scheduling system
  
- **Pass** (95%): Verify that the documentation accurately describes the handling of page revisions and extras
  
  The documentation thoroughly describes how page revisions and extras are created, updated, and deleted. It correctly identifies that new revisions are always created rather than updating existing ones. However, without seeing the complete implementation of how page revisions are used beyond storage (e.g., for rollbacks or comparisons), there's a small uncertainty about whether all aspects of revision handling are captured.
