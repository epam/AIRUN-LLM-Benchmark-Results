# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props

    The code uses TypeScript throughout with proper type definitions. All components have properly typed props interfaces (like `PageEditorProps`, `ButtonProps`, etc.). Functions have parameter and return type annotations, and state variables are properly typed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management

    Redux Toolkit is properly implemented using `createSlice` for state management. The code includes several slices (`pageSlice.ts`, `userSlice.ts`, `notificationSlice.ts`) that define initial state, reducers, and actions using the modern Redux Toolkit approach.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components

    All components in the solution are implemented as functional components. For example, `PageEditor`, `NewVersionWarning`, and UI components like `Button`, `Input`, etc. are all implemented using the functional component pattern with React hooks.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately

    React hooks are used properly throughout the code. For example, in `PageEditor.tsx`, `useEffect` is used for side effects like fetching data and local storage interaction, `useCallback` is used to memoize handlers, and `useMemo` is used to derive computed values.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource

    The code uses axios for API communication in `restService.ts`, replacing Angular's $resource pattern with a more React-appropriate approach.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components

    All form elements are implemented as controlled components where the value is tied to state and updated via handlers. For example, in `PageEditor.tsx`, form inputs have `value` props connected to Redux state and `onChange` handlers that dispatch actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation

    React Router is properly implemented. The code imports and uses `useNavigate`, `useParams`, and `useLocation` from `react-router-dom`. The `App.tsx` file defines routes using the `Routes` and `Route` components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization

    The code uses `react-i18next` for internationalization, with proper setup in `src/i18n/index.ts`. The `useTranslation` hook is used in components to access translations.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization

    While explicit `React.lazy` code splitting isn't shown in the provided snippets, the project structure is organized in a way that would support code splitting (components are in separate files, organized by feature). The explanation also mentions that code splitting would be implemented at the `App.tsx` level for route-based splitting in a larger application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations

    `React.memo` is used appropriately for UI components like `Button`, `Input`, `Select`, `RadioGroup`, and `TagInput` to prevent unnecessary renders when props haven't changed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks

    Dependency arrays are properly specified in `useEffect`, `useCallback`, and `useMemo` hooks throughout the code. For example, in `PageEditor.tsx`, the dependency arrays for various hooks correctly list the dependencies needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models

    TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models, including `PageState`, `UserState`, API types like `ContentPayload` and `ContentResponse`, and component props interfaces.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state

    Redux selectors using `useSelector` are implemented throughout the code to access state from the Redux store. For example, in `PageEditor.tsx`, `useSelector` is used to access the page state and current user state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations

    Action creators are properly implemented using Redux Toolkit's `createSlice`. Actions like `setPage`, `resetPage`, `updatePageField`, etc. are exported from the slices and used with `dispatch` throughout the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks

    Local storage functionality is implemented appropriately. While direct `localStorage` calls are used in `PageEditor.tsx` to maintain exact original behavior for unsaved versions, a generic `useLocalStorage` hook is also provided for other use cases.
