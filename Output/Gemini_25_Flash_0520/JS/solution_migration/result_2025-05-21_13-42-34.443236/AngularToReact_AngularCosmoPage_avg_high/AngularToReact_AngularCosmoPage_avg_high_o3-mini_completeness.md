# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
  All key operations are handled via Redux thunks. The code includes logic for creating a new page in savePage (via content.save), updating an existing page through content.update, duplicating a page, as well as deleting a page with deletePage. This confirms that the core page management functionalities are present.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
  The <Select> component in PageEditor is used for choosing the page type. The available options are constructed from the page.themePages array, ensuring that the user can select a page type.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
  The handleTitleChange function checks if the current URL is "new" or if autoURL is enabled. It generates a slug from the title using the slugify utility and dispatches an update to the URL field accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
  The TagInput component includes logic to parse comma-separated tags and dispatches an autocompleteTags action based on the last partial tag input. Autocomplete suggestions are displayed, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
  A RadioGroup component is used to offer three publish status options ("Y" for publish, "N" for draft, and "schedule"). This meets the requirement for managing various publish states.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
  When the "schedule" option is chosen, a <input type="datetime-local"> is rendered, using the formatted schedule date. The implementation within the savePage thunk correctly interprets the scheduled date for future publishing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
  The PageEditor component implements useEffect hooks that store specific fields (like title, description, etc.) in localStorage along with restoration logic via handleLocalVersion. The code compares local storage items with the current state to detect a newer version.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
  The code includes a Notification component along with a notificationSlice to show success and error messages. Redux thunks call showNotification in response to various outcomes, ensuring the notification system is fully implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
  Before saving a page, the savePage thunk checks for required values (e.g., the presence of page.url and page.type). If these validations fail, appropriate error notifications using i18n.t messages are triggered.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
  The restService file defines endpoints for content, content revisions, extras, and tags. The thunks make use of these endpoints to replicate the behavior of the original Angular REST calls, indicating that all necessary API endpoints are correctly handled.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
  In the savePage thunk, the code processes page.extras by deleting old extras and saving new ones through the contentExtras endpoints. Additionally, for each extra, corresponding revision extras are handled, fulfilling the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
  Revision management is integrated in the savePage thunk via calls to contentRevisions.save and contentRevisionsExtras.save. This approach preserves revision history similar to the original implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
  The project structure is well-organized into distinct folders (e.g., api, components, hooks, store, types, utils, i18n). Business logic resides primarily in Redux slices and thunks, while UI components are separated, ensuring maintainability and scalability.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
  The integration of react-i18next with the useTranslation hook, as well as translation keys defined in the locales file, confirms that internationalization and translation functionality are maintained.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
  The routing is managed with react-router-dom in App.tsx, providing consistent URL paths such as "/new" for new pages and "/:url" for existing pages. This preserves the URL structure intended in the original migration.
