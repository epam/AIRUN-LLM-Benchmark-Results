# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling
  
  The SignupComponent clearly uses Angular's Reactive Forms approach. This is evident from the import of FormBuilder, FormGroup, and Validators from '@angular/forms', the initialization of a FormGroup in the initForm() method, and the use of formControlName directives in the template.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)
  
  The form validation includes all required synchronous validations:
  - Name field has Validators.minLength(3) and Validators.maxLength(60)
  - Email field uses a custom AuthValidators.emailFormat validator
  - Password field has Validators.minLength(6)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use
  
  The component properly implements asynchronous validation for both name and email fields:
  - The name field uses AuthValidators.nameExists(this.apiService) which checks if the name already exists
  - The email field uses AuthValidators.emailExists(this.apiService) which checks if the email already exists
  - Both validators make API calls and return appropriate validation errors when the name or email is already taken

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched
  
  The FormGroupComponent is responsible for displaying validation feedback and properly implements:
  - Bootstrap validation styling classes ('has-error', 'has-success')
  - Feedback icons that appear when fields are touched or dirty
  - Logic to determine validation status through the bsStyle and hasFeedback getters

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions
  
  The onSubmit() method in the SignupComponent properly:
  - Checks if the form is valid before submitting
  - Extracts name, email, and password values from the form
  - Dispatches the AuthActions.signup action with the form values
  - Marks all fields as touched when the form is invalid to show validation errors

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails
  
  The FormGroupComponent template includes a span with class "help-block" that conditionally displays appropriate error messages based on the specific validation error that occurred, including:
  - Name already taken
  - Email already taken
  - Minimum/maximum length requirements
  - Required field messages
  - Invalid email format
  - Server errors

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service
  
  The SignupComponent sets the page title using Angular's Title service:
  - Imports the Title service from '@angular/platform-browser'
  - Injects it in the constructor
  - Calls this.titleService.setTitle(getTitle('Signup')) in ngOnInit()
  - Uses the getTitle utility function that appends " | PodBaby" to the title

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management
  
  The application correctly implements NgRx for state management:
  - Store and actions are imported and used in the SignupComponent
  - Auth reducers, actions, effects, and selectors are defined in separate files
  - The AuthModule imports StoreModule.forFeature and EffectsModule.forFeature
  - The SignupComponent dispatches actions and subscribes to selectors

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress
  
  The submit button in the template has the [disabled] attribute bound to:
  - submitting$ observable (which tracks the loading state)
  - signupForm.invalid (disables when form validation fails)
  - signupForm.pending (disables during async validation)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses
  
  The AuthEffects class properly handles both success and error scenarios:
  - Maps successful responses to the signupSuccess action
  - Maps specific form validation errors to the signupFormError action
  - Maps general errors to the signupFailure action
  - Includes a separate effect to navigate to the dashboard on successful signup

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management
  
  The SignupComponent follows best practices:
  - Implements OnInit and OnDestroy interfaces
  - Properly manages subscriptions with takeUntil and a destroy$ Subject
  - Cleans up resources in ngOnDestroy()
  - Uses OnPush change detection strategy for performance in sub-components
  - Separates concerns with proper component structure

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises
  
  The ApiService correctly uses Angular's HttpClient for API calls:
  - HttpClient is imported and injected in the constructor
  - API methods return Observables rather than Promises
  - The code includes commented examples of the actual HTTP calls using this.http.get and this.http.post
  - The current implementation uses mock data with of() and delay() to simulate HTTP requests

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements
  
  The FormGroupComponent template includes all the required error messages:
  - "This name is already in use" for nameTaken error
  - "This email is already in use" for emailTaken error
  - "Name must be between 3 and 60 characters in length" for minlength/maxlength errors
  - "Password must be at least 6 characters" for password minlength error
  - "This field is required" for required errors
  - "A valid email address is required" for email format errors
  - Dynamic server errors display the actual error message from the server
