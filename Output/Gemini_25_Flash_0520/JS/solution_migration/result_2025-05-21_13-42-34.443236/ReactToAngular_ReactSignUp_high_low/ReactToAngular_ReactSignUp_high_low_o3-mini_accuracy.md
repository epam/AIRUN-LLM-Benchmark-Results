# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The SignupComponent initializes the form using FormBuilder.group, which is part of Angular’s Reactive Forms module.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The component defines the validators for the "name" control (required, minLength(3), maxLength(60)), the "email" control (required and a custom email format validator), and the "password" control (required, minLength(6)).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  The "name" and "email" controls include asynchronous validators (AuthValidators.nameExists and AuthValidators.emailExists) that call the API service to check for existing users.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The reusable FormGroupComponent applies Bootstrap classes for error and success states based on the control’s touched/dirty and valid/invalid status, and displays corresponding feedback icons and error messages.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  On form submission, if valid, the SignupComponent dispatches the signup action through the NgRx store, which is handled by an effect that calls the API service’s signup method.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The FormGroupComponent’s template provides error message containers with conditions for various error types (e.g., required, minlength, email, serverError), ensuring that errors are shown when validation fails.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  The SignupComponent calls TitleService.setTitle with a title generated by getTitle('Signup'), ensuring the document title is updated appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The component dispatches actions to the NgRx store, selectors are used to observe authentication state, and the AuthModule registers both the reducer and effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button in the template uses a [disabled] binding that checks for (submitting$ | async), form validity, and pending state, thereby disabling submission appropriately during processing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  In the AuthEffects, the signup effect processes the API service signup call, mapping successful responses to signupSuccess and catching errors to dispatch either signupFailure or signupFormError based on the error content.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component implements OnInit and OnDestroy, uses a Subject for managing subscriptions, and follows a clear separation of concerns between presentation and logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The ApiService injects HttpClient to handle API interactions; even though the code uses mock responses with rxjs ‘of’ and ‘delay’, the structure is set up to seamlessly switch to real HttpClient calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The error messages in FormGroupComponent match the specified criteria, including messages for nameTaken, emailTaken, minlength/maxlength validations, required fields, email format, and server errors.
