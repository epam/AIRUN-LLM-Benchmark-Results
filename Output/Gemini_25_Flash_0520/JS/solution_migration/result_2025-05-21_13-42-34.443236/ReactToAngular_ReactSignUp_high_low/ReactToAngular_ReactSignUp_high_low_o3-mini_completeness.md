- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component includes all three required form fields: name, email, and password  
  The SignupComponent’s form initialization defines controls for "name", "email", and "password" and the template contains matching input fields.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page includes a heading 'Join PodBaby today.'  
  The template contains an <h2> element with the text "Join PodBaby today."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a lead paragraph about membership benefits  
  The presence of a <p> element with the CSS class "lead" and an explanatory message confirms this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form includes a submit button with appropriate styling and icon  
  The form includes a styled button (with "btn btn-primary form-control" classes) containing an <app-icon> component with the correct icon attribute.

  A link is provided in the template via a routerLink="/login/" with the text "Already a member? Log in here."

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the FormGroup component or equivalent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display  
  The SharedModule includes a FormGroupComponent that encapsulates form-group styling, error classes, and displays error messages appropriately.

  An IconComponent is implemented in the SharedModule. It accepts an icon input and is used in the signup button.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all validation rules are implemented (name length, email format, password length)  
  The form uses Angular validators:  
  • For the name field: required, minlength(3), maxlength(60)  
  • For the email field: required and a custom email format validator (AuthValidators.emailFormat)  
  • For the password field: required and minlength(6)  
  These meet the specified validation rules.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure asynchronous validation for both name and email uniqueness is implemented  
  Asynchronous validators (AuthValidators.nameExists and AuthValidators.emailExists) are attached to the name and email controls respectively, ensuring uniqueness via simulated API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API integration is complete with proper error handling  
  The ApiService provides a signup method simulating API calls, and NgRx effects in AuthEffects handle the success, general failure, and form-specific error cases, ensuring proper error handling and state management.

  The signup form uses the class "form-horizontal" and the structure renders form groups with input fields, consistent with a horizontal layout style.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page has proper document title setting functionality
