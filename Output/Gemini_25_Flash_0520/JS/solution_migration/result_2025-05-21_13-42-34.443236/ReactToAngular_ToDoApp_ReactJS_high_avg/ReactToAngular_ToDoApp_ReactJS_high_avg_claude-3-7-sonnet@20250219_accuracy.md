# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The code clearly shows the use of Angular 14.x framework, as evidenced by the installation command `ng add @ngrx/store@14 @ngrx/effects@14 @ngrx/store-devtools@14` and the import statements referencing Angular core features throughout the codebase.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
  
  The code extensively implements NgRx store for state management, with proper store setup in app.module.ts and dedicated store files in the todos module including todos.actions.ts, todos.reducer.ts, todos.selectors.ts, and todos.state.ts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
  
  The code includes a properly implemented TodosEffects class with effects for loading todos from localStorage and saving todos to localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
  
  The code contains comprehensive actions (addTodo, toggleTodo, etc.), a well-structured reducer with immutable state updates, and detailed selectors for querying different aspects of the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
  
  All components correctly use the @Component decorator and where appropriate, @Input and @Output decorators for component communication.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators
  
  React refs have been correctly replaced with Angular's @ViewChild, as seen in the TodosPageComponent with `@ViewChild('newField') newFieldInput!: ElementRef<HTMLInputElement>;`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
  
  Components like TodoItemComponent and TodoFooterComponent correctly use @Input() to receive data and @Output() with EventEmitter for sending events to parent components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
  
  The code properly implements Angular services like LocalStorageService and UtilsService for handling business logic and data operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
  
  Dependency injection is correctly implemented throughout the application, with services provided in the appropriate modules and injected into components and effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
  
  The code applies ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush to presentational components like TodoItemComponent and TodoFooterComponent for optimized rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
  
  Angular Router is properly implemented with router modules at both app and feature module levels, with appropriate route configurations for all required paths.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The application follows Angular style guide conventions with proper naming (kebab-case for files, PascalCase for classes), feature modules, appropriate file structure, and separation of concerns.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
  
  TypeScript interfaces and types are consistently used throughout the application, with clear definitions for ITodo, TodoFilter, and proper typing for all methods and properties.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
  
  All JSX templates have been properly converted to Angular HTML templates with appropriate Angular directives like *ngFor, *ngIf, and [ngClass].

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
  
  React event handlers have been correctly replaced with Angular event bindings using parentheses syntax like (click), (change), (keydown), etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs
  
  The code does not contain any TODO comments, indicating a complete migration.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules
  
  Lazy loading is properly implemented in the AppRoutingModule with `loadChildren: () => import('./todos/todos.module').then(m => m.TodosModule)`.
