# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items

    The solution properly implements displaying todo items through the `TodoListComponent` which renders a list of `TodoItemComponent` instances. The todos are retrieved from the store using the `filteredTodos$` observable in `TodosPageComponent` and passed to the list component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented

    Adding new todos is implemented in the `TodosPageComponent` through the `handleNewTodoKeyDown` method, which dispatches the `addTodo` action when the Enter key is pressed and the input contains a non-empty value.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works

    The toggle functionality is properly implemented with the `toggleTodo` action in the store and the `onToggle` method in `TodoItemComponent`, allowing users to mark items as complete or incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented

    Editing is fully implemented with double-click to enter edit mode, escape to cancel, and enter/blur to save changes. The implementation uses the `setEditingTodoId` action to track which item is being edited and the `updateTodo` action to save changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented

    Deletion is implemented through the `destroyTodo` action which is dispatched when the user clicks the destroy button in the `TodoItemComponent`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented

    The 'Mark all as complete' checkbox is implemented in the `TodoListComponent` and triggers the `toggleAllTodos` action which updates all todo items' completed status based on the checkbox state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works

    Filtering is implemented through Angular Router with routes for '/all', '/active', and '/completed'. The `TodosPageComponent` subscribes to route changes and updates the filter state accordingly. The `selectFilteredTodos` selector then applies the filter to display the appropriate todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items

    The footer correctly displays the count of active items through the `activeTodoCount$` observable passed to the `TodoFooterComponent`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items

    The 'Clear completed' button in the `TodoFooterComponent` dispatches the `clearCompletedTodos` action which filters out completed todos from the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage

    Persistence is implemented using NgRx Effects. The `saveTodos$` effect responds to actions that modify todos by saving the current state to localStorage through the `LocalStorageService`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation

    The solution maintains the original URL structure with hash-based routing enabled via `useHash: true` in the `AppRoutingModule`, and routes for '/all', '/active', and '/completed'.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states

    Empty states are handled with `*ngIf="hasTodos"` conditional rendering in the `TodosPageComponent` template, ensuring appropriate UI is shown when there are no todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly

    Form submissions (adding new todos and editing existing ones) are properly handled with key event listeners and validation to ensure empty values are not saved. The ENTER_KEY and ESCAPE_KEY constants are used consistently.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships

    The solution implements a clean component hierarchy with container components (`TodosPageComponent`) and presentational components (`TodoListComponent`, `TodoItemComponent`, `TodoFooterComponent`), following Angular best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved

    All business logic from the original React application has been successfully migrated to Angular with NgRx. The application maintains functionality for creating, reading, updating, and deleting todos, filtering, toggling all, clearing completed, and persistence to localStorage.
