# Evaluation Report

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The migration clearly shows use of Angular 14 with the project setup command “ng new angular-todo-app --routing --style=scss --strict” and module configurations that conform to Angular 14 conventions.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The application integrates the NgRx store by importing StoreModule and defining a feature store for todos. The configuration and use of NgRx are evident in the implementation.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  The provided code includes a dedicated file for effects (todos.effects.ts) that handles side effects such as loading from and saving to localStorage, confirming the proper use of NgRx effects.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  The migration includes clear implementations for actions (todos.actions.ts), reducers (todos.reducer.ts), and selectors (todos.selectors.ts) which meet standard NgRx practices.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  All components (for example, TodoFooterComponent, TodoItemComponent, TodoListComponent, and TodosPageComponent) are decorated with @Component and make proper use of @Input and @Output where necessary.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  The migration replaces React’s refs mechanism with Angular’s @ViewChild (e.g., in TodoItemComponent and TodosPageComponent), ensuring proper access to DOM elements.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  The communication between components through property binding and event emitters (e.g., handling toggling, editing, and clearing todos) has been correctly implemented using @Input and @Output decorators.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  Services such as UtilsService and LocalStorageService have been created and injected properly to handle business logic and data operations like generating UUIDs and interacting with localStorage.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  The migration leverages Angular’s dependency injection throughout the application (e.g., injecting services in components and effects), following recommended Angular practices.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush is applied in several components (e.g., TodoFooterComponent, TodoItemComponent, and TodoListComponent) to optimize performance.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  Angular Router is properly integrated via the AppRoutingModule and feature routing in TodosRoutingModule. Routes for “all”, “active”, and “completed” are clearly defined.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code structure, file naming, and module separation adhere to Angular’s style guide conventions.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  Interfaces (e.g., ITodo, TodoFilter) and types are consistently used across services, actions, and components to enforce strong typing.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  All JSX templates from the React application have been replaced with Angular HTML templates, as evident in the component template files.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  The transition from React event handlers to Angular event bindings is complete (e.g., using (click), (keydown), and (change) directives).

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  A review of the code shows no “TODO” comments, indicating that the migration is clean in this respect.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  The TodosModule is lazy-loaded via the AppRoutingModule, which follows Angular best practices for code splitting and lazy initialization.
