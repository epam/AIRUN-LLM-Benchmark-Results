# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The implementation uses the TodoListComponent and binds the list via an observable ("filteredTodos$") from the NgRx store. This ensures that all todos are displayed as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodosPageComponent captures input via the "new-todo" input field and dispatches the addTodo action when the ENTER key is pressed, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  In the TodoItemComponent, the checkbox input triggers the handleToggle() method, which dispatches a toggleTodo action. This implementation correctly toggles the state of each todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent supports entering editing mode (on double-click) and handles editing, saving (on blur or pressing ENTER), and cancelling edits, ensuring this functionality is in place.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  The "destroy" button in TodoItemComponent triggers the handleDestroy() method which dispatches a destroyTodo action, allowing todos to be deleted.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  The TodoListComponent includes a "toggle-all" checkbox. Its change event emits the toggleAll action with the correct boolean value, enabling the mark-all-complete functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  The routing configuration and NgRx selectors (selectTodoFilter and selectFilteredTodos) correctly process URL segments and filter the displayed todos accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooterComponent accepts "activeTodoCount" as an input and displays it along with the correct pluralized word, satisfying this step.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The TodoFooterComponent renders a "Clear completed" button when there are completed todos, and clicking it dispatches the clearCompletedTodos action, which removes completed items from the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  The TodosEffects includes an effect that listens to todo-related actions and calls the LocalStorageService methods to load and save todos, ensuring persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The routing in both the TodosRoutingModule and AppRoutingModule set up routes for "all", "active", and "completed" (using useHash: true) to mimic the original application's URL structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  The Todo-footer and Todo-list templates include conditional displays (using *ngIf) which ensure that the UI reacts appropriately when there are no todos (e.g., hiding the main section or footer when empty).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  The new-todo input in the TodosPageComponent listens for keydown events and processes form submissions correctly (preventing default actions, trimming input, and dispatching the addTodo action).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The application cleanly separates container (TodosPageComponent) and presentational components (TodoListComponent, TodoItemComponent, TodoFooterComponent), and their inputs/outputs are correctly wired, ensuring proper component relationships.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  The migration covers all core functionalities (CRUD operations, persistence, filtering, toggling, and editing) along with component separation and state management using NgRx.  
  Although the business logic appears comprehensively migrated, confidence is marginally reduced (90%) because subtle edge cases from the original implementation may require further integration testing to validate full parity.
