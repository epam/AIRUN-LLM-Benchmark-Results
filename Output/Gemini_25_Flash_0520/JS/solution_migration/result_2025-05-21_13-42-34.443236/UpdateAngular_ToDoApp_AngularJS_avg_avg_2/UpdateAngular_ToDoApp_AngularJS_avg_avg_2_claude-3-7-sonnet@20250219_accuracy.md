# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The code explicitly mentions Angular 14.x in the imports and project setup. The structure and syntax are consistent with Angular 14.x, including the use of modern decorators, Angular CLI setup commands, and current API patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS
  
  The code exclusively uses ES module syntax (`import`/`export`) throughout all files, completely replacing RequireJS module pattern. All component, service, and other files use proper ES module imports.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management
  
  The code includes proper implementation of @ngrx/store with StoreModule being imported and configured in the app.module.ts file, and store being injected in components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects
  
  The code properly implements @ngrx/effects, including a TodoEffects class that handles side effects for loading and saving todos to localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management
  
  The code includes well-structured actions, reducers, selectors, and effects files. Actions are defined using createAction, reducers use createReducer, selectors use createSelector, and effects handle side effects for localStorage operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator
  
  The TodoStorageService is properly decorated with @Injectable and specifies providedIn: 'root' for application-wide singleton pattern.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service
  
  The TodoStorageService properly implements localStorage for data persistence with getTodos and putTodos methods that interact with localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators
  
  All components (AppComponent, TodoHeaderComponent, TodoListComponent, TodoItemComponent, TodoFooterComponent) use the @Component decorator with appropriate metadata.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators
  
  Both custom directives (TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective) use the @Directive decorator with appropriate selector metadata.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)
  
  The templates use proper Angular syntax, including *ngFor in todo-list.component.html, *ngIf in app.component.html and todo-footer.component.html, and other Angular-specific template syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))
  
  The code uses proper event binding syntax throughout, such as (click), (change), (ngSubmit), (dblclick), and custom event bindings using the @Output() decorator.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])
  
  Property binding is correctly implemented using the Angular syntax with square brackets, including [class.completed], [checked], [routerLink], and [todoFocus].

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed
  
  The code properly implements OnInit in AppComponent for initializing data and OnChanges in TodoItemComponent for handling changes to the editing state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models
  
  The code defines and uses a Todo interface in models/todo.model.ts, which is properly imported and used throughout the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services
  
  Dependency injection is correctly implemented in all components and services using constructor injection for Store, Actions, TodoStorageService, etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code follows Angular style guide conventions with proper naming (kebab-case for files, PascalCase for classes), organization of code into appropriate modules, and clean separation of concerns.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings
  
  The code appears well-structured and should run without errors. However, without actually running the code, I cannot be 100% certain that no runtime errors would occur.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)
  
  The code makes appropriate use of TypeScript features including interfaces, strong typing, generics, access modifiers, and type annotations throughout.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code
  
  The provided code does not contain any TODO comments or commented-out code sections.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design
  
  Each component has a clear, single responsibility: AppComponent orchestrates the overall application, TodoHeaderComponent handles adding new todos, TodoListComponent manages the list, TodoItemComponent handles individual item display and editing, and TodoFooterComponent manages filtering and statistics.
