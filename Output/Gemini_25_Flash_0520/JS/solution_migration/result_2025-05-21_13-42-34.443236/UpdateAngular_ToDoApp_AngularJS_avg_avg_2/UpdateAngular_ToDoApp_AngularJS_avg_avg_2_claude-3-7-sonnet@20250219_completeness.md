# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list
    
    The application has a `TodoListComponent` located in `src/app/components/todo-list/todo-list.component.ts` that handles displaying the list of todos. This component receives todos as an input from its parent and renders them using the `app-todo-item` component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos
    
    The application has a `TodoHeaderComponent` located in `src/app/components/todo-header/todo-header.component.ts` which provides the input field and functionality for adding new todos. It emits an `addTodo` event when a new todo is submitted.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos
    
    The `TodoItemComponent` in `src/app/components/todo-item/todo-item.component.ts` handles the editing of existing todos. It provides the interface for displaying and editing a single todo, including the ability to toggle completion, remove the todo, and edit its title.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos
    
    The `TodoFooterComponent` in `src/app/components/todo-footer/todo-footer.component.html` includes the filtering functionality with `routerLink` directives for "All", "Active", and "Completed" filter options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics
    
    The `TodoFooterComponent` also handles displaying count statistics, showing the number of remaining items with appropriate pluralization and displaying the clear completed button when completed todos exist.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos
    
    The application implements adding new todos in `AppComponent` by dispatching the `TodoActions.addTodo` action when receiving the `onAddTodo` event from the `TodoHeaderComponent`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos
    
    The application implements editing functionality in the `TodoListComponent` and `TodoItemComponent`. The `TodoListComponent` tracks which todo is being edited with `editedTodoId` and handles the editing state, while the `TodoItemComponent` manages the editing UI and inputs.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos
    
    The application implements deletion of todos with the `removeTodo` action in NgRx, which is dispatched from the `TodoListComponent` when a todo's destroy button is clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed
    
    The toggle functionality is implemented through the `toggleTodo` action, which is dispatched from the `TodoListComponent` when a todo's checkbox is toggled.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)
    
    The application uses Angular Router with routes defined for different filters. The `selectFilteredTodos` selector in `todo.selectors.ts` handles filtering todos based on the current URL.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete
    
    The toggle-all functionality is implemented in the `AppComponent` with the `onToggleAll` method that dispatches the `toggleAll` action when the master checkbox is clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos
    
    The clear completed functionality is implemented in the `AppComponent` with the `onClearCompleted` method that dispatches the `clearCompletedTodos` action when the "Clear completed" button is clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos
    
    The count of remaining todos is selected from the store using the `selectRemainingCount` selector and passed to the `TodoFooterComponent` which displays it.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage
    
    The application persists todos in localStorage through the `TodoStorageService` and NgRx effects. The `saveTodos$` effect saves todos to localStorage whenever any todo-related action is dispatched.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization
    
    The application loads persisted todos on initialization by dispatching the `loadTodos` action in the `ngOnInit` method of the `AppComponent`. This action triggers the `loadTodos$` effect which retrieves todos from localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing
    
    The application handles escape key press through the `TodoEscapeDirective`, which emits an event when the escape key is pressed. This is used in the `TodoItemComponent` to revert editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo
    
    The application uses the `TodoFocusDirective` to automatically focus on the input field when a todo enters editing mode. This directive is applied to the edit input field with `[todoFocus]="isEditing"`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original
    
    The application imports the original TodoMVC CSS files and maintains the same HTML structure and class names as the original, ensuring consistent visual appearance.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately
    
    The application handles empty todo titles in the `TodoListComponent.onDoneEditing` method, which removes a todo if its title is empty after trimming.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter
    
    The application updates the URL based on the selected filter through Angular's RouterModule which is configured in the AppModule. The TodoFooterComponent uses routerLink directives for navigation.
