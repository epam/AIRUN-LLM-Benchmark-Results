# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The solution explicitly targets Angular 14.x, as noted in the description and evidenced by the Angular module structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
  The code uses modern ES module syntax (import/export) everywhere, with no evidence of RequireJS.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
  The application sets up NgRx via StoreModule.forRoot and utilizes a reducer (todoReducer) supported by NgRx Entity.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
  The solution provides a TodoEffects class registered with EffectsModule.forRoot to handle localStorage operations and other side effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
  The provided code defines a comprehensive set of actions (e.g., addTodo, toggleTodo), a reducer using NgRx Entity, selectors for filtering and state derivation, and effects for loading/saving todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
  The TodoStorageService is defined with @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }), ensuring proper dependency injection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
  The TodoStorageService directly accesses localStorage to get and put todos, ensuring persistent storage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
  All components (AppComponent, TodoHeaderComponent, TodoListComponent, TodoItemComponent, TodoFooterComponent) are defined with @Component and appropriate metadata.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
  Both custom directives (todoFocus and todoEscape) correctly utilize the @Directive decorator.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
  The templates employ Angular syntax such as *ngFor, *ngIf, routerLink, and routerLinkActive consistently.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
  All event bindings (e.g., (click), (ngSubmit), (dblclick)) are correctly applied in the templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
  The application uses property bindings like [class.completed] and [(ngModel)] appropriately in its templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
  Lifecycle hooks such as ngOnInit in AppComponent and ngOnChanges in TodoItemComponent are implemented appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
  A clear Todo interface is defined in the models to enforce type contracts.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
  The solution correctly injects Store and other dependencies via constructor injection through Angularâ€™s DI system.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code is modular, uses OnPush change detection where appropriate, assigns responsibilities clearly, and follows best practices in naming and structure.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
  While the code appears clean and follows Angular best practices, confirmation of zero runtime console errors would require execution; however, the static analysis gives strong confidence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
  The solution employs TypeScript features like interfaces, type hints in function parameters, and strict type annotations consistently.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
  The provided code is clean with no TODO comments or extraneous commented-out code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design  
  Each component, service, and directive is designed with a clear and focused responsibility, such as presentation (components), state management (NgRx), persistence (TodoStorageService), etc.
