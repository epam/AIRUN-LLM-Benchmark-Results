# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list  
  The solution includes the “TodoListComponent” (and “TodoItemComponent” for individual items) which are responsible for displaying the todo list.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos  
  The “TodoHeaderComponent” is implemented to capture new todo entries, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos  
  The editing functionality is provided via the “TodoItemComponent”, which handles user interactions (edit, done editing, revert) necessary for editing a todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos  
  Filtering is supported through the “TodoFooterComponent” with router links and selectors that filter based on URL (all, active, completed).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics  
  The “TodoFooterComponent” displays counts (remaining, done, total) which meets this evaluation step.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos  
  Functionality is implemented in the “TodoHeaderComponent” by dispatching the addTodo action and handled by NgRx in the reducer.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos  
  The editing flow is supported within “TodoItemComponent” where the onDoneEditing method dispatches the updateTodoTitle action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos  
  A delete functionality is provided via the removeTodo action, triggered from the “TodoItemComponent” when the delete button is clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed  
  The toggleTodo action enables marking individual todos as completed and is clearly implemented in the reducer and components.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)  
  URL-based filtering is implemented using Angular’s router and selectors that filter based on the current URL.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete  
  The “toggleAll” functionality is implemented in the AppComponent with the corresponding NgRx action and reducer logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos  
  The clearCompletedTodos action is available and is dispatched from the footer when clearing completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos  
  The remaining count is computed using a selector and is displayed in the “TodoFooterComponent.”

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage  
  The TodoStorageService is implemented to persist and read todos from localStorage, meeting this criterion.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization  
  On initialization (ngOnInit in AppComponent), the loadTodos action is dispatched, ensuring persisted todos are loaded.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing  
  The “TodoEscapeDirective” listens for escape key events and emits an event to cancel editing, as required.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo  
  The “TodoFocusDirective” together with the component’s ngOnChanges logic ensures that the input field receives focus when editing begins.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original  
  The project setup includes copying original CSS files (base.css, index.css) from Todomvc and references them in the angular.json. Although the integration is consistent with the original design, slight visual differences might occur due to Angular’s rendering differences or additional styling nuances.  
  Explanation: Confidence is set to 90% because while the necessary CSS files are included, subtle differences in Angular’s default styling could lead to minor variations compared to the original.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately  
  The implementation trims input and, if empty, dispatches the removal action—ensuring that empty titles are handled correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter  
  The routing configuration includes parameterized routes (e.g., “:filter”) and the “TodoFooterComponent” uses routerLink directives to update the URL as the filter changes.
