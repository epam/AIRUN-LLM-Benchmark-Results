# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed
  
  The code includes a `handleNewTodoKeyDown` function in the `TodoApp` component that checks for the ENTER_KEY, prevents default behavior, gets the trimmed value from the input field, and dispatches the `addTodo` action if the value exists.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter
  
  The application uses the `shownTodos` memoized value which filters todos based on the `nowShowing` state variable that controls which filter is active (ALL_TODOS, ACTIVE_TODOS, or COMPLETED_TODOS).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos
  
  The application includes a `handleToggleAll` function in the `TodoApp` component which dispatches the `toggleAll` action with the checked status. The Redux slice properly handles this by setting all todos' completed status.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted
  
  The `TodoItem` component includes handlers for toggling (via `onToggle`), editing (via `onEdit`), and deleting (via `onDestroy`) each todo item. These actions are dispatched to the Redux store.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode
  
  The `TodoItem` component includes a label with an `onDoubleClick={handleEdit}` event handler that calls `onEdit`, which sets the editing todo ID in the parent component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo
  
  In the `TodoItem` component, the `handleKeyDown` function checks if the pressed key is ENTER_KEY and calls `handleSubmit` which saves the edited todo value.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value
  
  The `handleKeyDown` function in `TodoItem` checks if the pressed key is ESCAPE_KEY, resets the edit text to the original todo title, and calls `onCancel` to exit editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The `TodoFooter` component displays the count of active items with `<strong>{count}</strong> {activeTodoWord} left`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The `TodoFooter` component renders filter links for "All", "Active", and "Completed" using the `filterLink` function, which creates anchor tags with hash-based routes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos
  
  The `TodoFooter` component conditionally renders a "Clear completed" button if there are completed todos. The button has an `onClick` handler that calls `onClearCompleted`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence
  
  The application uses a `localStorageService` utility with get and set methods to persist todos. The Redux slice loads initial state from localStorage and updates localStorage when todos change.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state
  
  The application conditionally renders the main section and footer based on the presence of todos. The "Clear completed" button is conditionally shown based on the existence of completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count
  
  The application includes a `pluralize` utility function that correctly handles singular/plural forms based on count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components
  
  The application is broken down into focused components: `TodoApp` (main orchestrator), `TodoItem` (individual todo), and `TodoFooter` (filtering and statistics), following good component composition practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality
  
  The code is well-structured with directories organized by feature/functionality: `app/`, `components/`, `constants/`, `features/todos/`, `hooks/`, `utils/`, along with type definitions and store configuration files.
