# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The code uses an input field with an onKeyDown handler that checks for the Enter key (using ENTER_KEY), and if pressed, dispatches the addTodo action after trimming the input value.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The application filters todos based on the current filter (all, active, or completed) and renders the filtered todos as list items.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  The implementation includes a checkbox labeled "Mark all as complete" with an onChange handler that dispatches the toggleAll action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  Each TodoItem provides a checkbox for toggling completion, a button for deletion, and a double-click handler on the label to initiate editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  The TodoItem component attaches an onDoubleClick event on the label that triggers the onEdit callback, setting the todo into editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  In the TodoItem component, the onKeyDown handler checks for the Enter key and, when detected, calls handleSubmit to save the edited todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  The code listens for the Escape key in the onKeyDown event; when pressed, it reverts the edit text to the original title and triggers the onCancel callback.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooter component receives a count of active todos (computed in the main TodoApp component) and displays it properly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The footer renders filter links for "All," "Active," and "Completed" using a callback that assigns the proper href and applies conditional styling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  The TodoFooter includes a "Clear completed" button which is conditionally rendered when there are completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  The todosSlice uses localStorageService to get the initial todos and to update localStorage on every action that modifies todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  The main section and footer of the TodoApp component are conditionally rendered based on the presence of todos and the counts of active or completed items.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  The pluralize utility function is used in TodoFooter to correctly pluralize the word "item" based on the active todo count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The application is divided into well-defined components such as TodoApp, TodoItem, and TodoFooter, each handling a specific piece of functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The provided file structure clearly organizes components, features, utilities, and types into separate directories based on their respective responsibilities.
