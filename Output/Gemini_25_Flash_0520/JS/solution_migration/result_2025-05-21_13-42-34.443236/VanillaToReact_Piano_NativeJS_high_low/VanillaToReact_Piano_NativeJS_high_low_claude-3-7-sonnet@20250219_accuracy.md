# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration
  
  The application clearly uses React 18, as evidenced by the implementation in `index.tsx` using `ReactDOM.createRoot()` which is specific to React 18. The TypeScript configuration is evident throughout the codebase with `.tsx` file extensions and type definitions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure
  
  The solution properly defines TypeScript interfaces in `src/types.ts` with the `PianoKeyData` interface, and uses TypeScript typing throughout the application. The audio mapping is properly typed with `Record<string, HTMLAudioElement>` in the `Piano.tsx` component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks
  
  All components in the solution are implemented as functional components using React hooks. The components like `Piano`, `PianoKey`, `ButtonContainer`, `Header`, `Footer`, and `FullscreenButton` are defined using the `React.FC<PropType>` pattern, and utilize hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, and `useCallback`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)
  
  The solution demonstrates proper state management using React hooks. In `App.tsx`, `useState` is used to manage the `displayLetters` state. In `Piano.tsx`, `useState` manages the `activeNotes` state using a `Set<string>`. The `useEffect` hook is appropriately used for side effects like initializing audio objects and setting up/tearing down event listeners.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels
  
  Keyboard event handlers are correctly implemented in the `Piano.tsx` component using a `useEffect` hook to add and remove global event listeners for `keydown` and `keyup` events. The handlers use the `letterToNoteMap` to map keyboard letters to piano notes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events
  
  The mouse interactions are properly implemented in the `Piano.tsx` component using React synthetic events. The component uses event delegation by attaching event handlers to the piano container element and identifies target keys through `dataset` attributes, which is an efficient approach.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment
  
  Audio resources are properly handled with `useRef` to persist the audio objects across renders. The implementation correctly initializes audio objects once when the component mounts in a `useEffect` hook. The solution also properly handles URL encoding for sharp notes and includes error handling for audio playback.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility
  
  The fullscreen functionality is implemented correctly in `App.tsx` using the standard browser fullscreen API (`requestFullscreen()` and `exitFullscreen()`). It's wrapped in a `useCallback` hook and passed as a prop to the `FullscreenButton` component. Error handling is included to manage browser compatibility issues.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns
  
  Conditional class application is correctly implemented using template literals and logical expressions in the className attributes. For example, in `PianoKey.tsx`, classes are conditionally applied based on props, and in `Piano.tsx`, the `letters` class is conditionally applied based on the `displayLetters` state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate
  
  The solution uses `React.memo` for the `PianoKey` component, which is appropriate as this component will be rendered multiple times and its re-rendering should only depend on its props changing. Additionally, `useCallback` is used for event handlers in `Piano.tsx` to ensure stable function references for dependencies.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations
  
  Audio playback is handled with proper React lifecycle considerations. The audio objects are created once on component mount using `useEffect` with an empty dependency array, and the audio playback logic in the `playNote` function correctly resets the `currentTime` property before playing to allow rapid retriggering of sounds.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application
  
  The code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout. All components, props, and state are properly typed. The `PianoKeyData` interface is used to type piano key data, and other types like `Set<string>` and `Record<string, HTMLAudioElement>` are used appropriately.
