# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'
    
    The `Header.tsx` component properly renders a header with the title "Virtual Piano" using the appropriate HTML structure and CSS classes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons
    
    The `ButtonContainer.tsx` component renders two buttons labeled "Notes" and "Letters" with appropriate CSS classes, including the correct active state logic based on the `displayLetters` prop.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)
    
    The `Piano.tsx` component renders all white keys from `whiteKeysData` and all sharp keys from `sharpKeysData`, including the empty placeholder for the gap between E and F, using the appropriate component structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes
    
    The `PianoKey.tsx` component correctly sets the `data-letter` and `data-note` attributes for each piano key based on the props passed to it.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked
    
    The application properly initializes audio objects using `useRef` and `useEffect`, loads the correct audio files from the appropriate paths, and plays them when piano keys are clicked using the `playNote` function.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)
    
    The application maintains an `activeNotes` state in the `Piano` component and passes the active state to each `PianoKey` component, which then applies the `piano-key-active` class appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes
    
    The application sets up global event listeners for keyboard events in a `useEffect` hook in the `Piano` component, maps keyboard letters to notes using the `letterToNoteMap`, and triggers the appropriate piano key when a corresponding key is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked
    
    The application uses the `displayLetters` state in the `App` component and passes it to both the `ButtonContainer` and `Piano` components. Clicking the buttons correctly updates this state through the `toggleDisplay` callback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes
    
    The `FullscreenButton` component correctly triggers the `handleFullscreen` function in `App.tsx`, which properly implements the fullscreen API using `requestFullscreen()` and `exitFullscreen()` methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly
    
    The application uses a `Set` data structure for the `activeNotes` state, which allows for correctly tracking multiple simultaneous key presses without duplicates.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys
    
    The `Piano` component implements a `handleMouseMove` function that checks if the left mouse button is pressed (`event.buttons === 1`) and triggers the appropriate note when dragging across keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information
    
    The `Footer.tsx` component correctly renders a footer with the year "2020" in a div with the appropriate CSS classes.
