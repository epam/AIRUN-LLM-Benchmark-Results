# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'.  
  The Header component includes an <code>&lt;h1 className="header-title"&gt;Virtual Piano&lt;/h1&gt;</code>, ensuring the correct title is rendered.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons.  
  The <code>ButtonContainer</code> component renders two buttons labeled "Notes" and "Letters" and correctly toggles the display state on click.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys).  
  The <code>Piano</code> component renders the keys by iterating over both <code>whiteKeysData</code> and <code>sharpKeysData</code> arrays. The natural keys are rendered directly, and the sharp keys are rendered within a container with the class <code>keys-sharp</code>.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes.  
  The <code>PianoKey</code> component assigns <code>data-letter</code> and <code>data-note</code> attributes to each key, which satisfy the verification requirement.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked.  
  Audio objects are initialized in the <code>Piano</code> component using <code>new Audio()</code> with the appropriate file paths, and the <code>playNote</code> function correctly resets and plays the sound.  
  Explanation: This step is rated at 95% because while the implementation appears correct, actual audio playback can depend on browser policies and autoplay restrictions which are only partially mitigated by the included <code>.catch</code> error handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed).  
  The <code>activeNotes</code> state is used in conjunction with a memoized <code>PianoKey</code> component, which conditionally applies the <code>piano-key-active</code> class based on its active status.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes.  
  Global event listeners for <code>keydown</code> and <code>keyup</code> are attached to handle keyboard input via the <code>letterToNoteMap</code> mapping, ensuring keys are played on keyboard input.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked.  
  The <code>displayLetters</code> state is toggled in the <code>App</code> component and passed down to both the <code>ButtonContainer</code> and <code>Piano</code> components, which then conditionally add the CSS class <code>letters</code>. This enables toggling between display modes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes.  
  The <code>FullscreenButton</code> component invokes a function that uses <code>document.documentElement.requestFullscreen()</code> and <code>document.exitFullscreen()</code>, correctly handling the fullscreen toggle.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly.  
  The use of a <code>Set</code> for the <code>activeNotes</code> state allows multiple keys to be active at the same time, which supports simultaneous key presses.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys.  
  The <code>Piano</code> component listens to the <code>onMouseMove</code> event and checks if the left mouse button is held down (<code>event.buttons === 1</code>), enabling continuous note triggering while dragging across keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information.  
  The <code>Footer</code> component renders a footer that contains the year "2020" as required.
