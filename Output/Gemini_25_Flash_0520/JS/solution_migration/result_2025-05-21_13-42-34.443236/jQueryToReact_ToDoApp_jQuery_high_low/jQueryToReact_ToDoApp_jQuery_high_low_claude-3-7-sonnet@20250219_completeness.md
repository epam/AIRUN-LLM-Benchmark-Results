# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos
  
  The application has a dedicated `Header` component with an `h1` title element ("todos") and the `NewTodoInput` component which renders an input field with placeholder "What needs to be done?" and handles todo creation functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos
  
  The `Main` component contains both the `ToggleAll` component (implementing the checkbox to toggle all todos) and the `TodoList` component that displays the list of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button
  
  The `TodoItem` component renders each todo with a toggle checkbox (class "toggle"), a label displaying the todo title, and a destroy button (class "destroy") for deletion.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode
  
  The `TodoItem` component includes an `onDoubleClick` handler on the label element that calls `handleDoubleClick()`, which sets the `isEditing` state to true and focuses the edit input.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The application implements filtering through React Router with routes for "/all", "/active", and "/completed". The `Filters` component renders filter links and the `TodoList` component uses `selectFilteredTodos` to show the appropriate todos based on the current filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization
  
  The `TodoCount` component shows the count of active todos and uses the `pluralize` helper function to correctly display "item" or "items" based on the count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter
  
  The `Filters` component uses `NavLink` from React Router to create links for each filter option. The `className` callback applies the "selected" class to the active filter link.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist
  
  The `ClearCompletedButton` component only renders when there are completed todos (`completedTodoCount > 0`), and includes the "Clear completed" text and appropriate click handler.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter
  
  The `NewTodoInput` component handles input changes with `handleNewTodoChange` and responds to the Enter key with `handleNewTodoKeyDown`, dispatching the `addTodo` action when the Enter key is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos
  
  The `TodoItem` component includes a toggle checkbox with an `onChange` handler that dispatches the `toggleTodo` action to update the todo's completion status.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once
  
  The `ToggleAll` component implements toggling all todos with a checkbox that dispatches the `toggleAllTodos` action when changed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management
  
  The `TodoItem` component uses the `useFocus` hook to manage focus on the edit input field when entering edit mode. The component sets focus via `setEditInputFocus()` in a `useEffect` that runs when `isEditing` becomes true.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos
  
  Each `TodoItem` includes a destroy button with an `onClick` handler that dispatches the `deleteTodo` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos
  
  The `ClearCompletedButton` component has an `onClick` handler that dispatches the `clearCompletedTodos` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status
  
  The `selectFilteredTodos` selector in combination with the route parameters ensures that todos are filtered correctly based on the current filter. The selector returns the appropriate subset of todos (all, active, or completed) which `TodoList` then renders.
