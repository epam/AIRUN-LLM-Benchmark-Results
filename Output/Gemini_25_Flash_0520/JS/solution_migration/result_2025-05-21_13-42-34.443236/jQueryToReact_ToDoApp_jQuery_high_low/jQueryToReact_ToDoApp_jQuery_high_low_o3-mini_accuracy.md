# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18.x  
  The code uses ReactDOM.createRoot, which is a React 18 feature, confirming that the application is built with React 18.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript for type safety  
  All source files, components, hooks, and Redux-related files are written in TypeScript with proper types and interfaces defined.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for state management  
  The state management is implemented using Redux Toolkit’s createSlice (e.g., in todosSlice.ts), as required.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm nanoid is used for generating unique IDs  
  The helper function generateId utilizes nanoid to generate unique IDs for the todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code uses functional components with hooks instead of class components  
  All the components are written as functional components and use React hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect, useRef) throughout the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains the same routing functionality with proper route handling  
  The application employs react-router-dom with defined routes (including a default redirection from “/” to “/all”), ensuring correct filter-based routing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Redux store is properly configured with appropriate slices  
  The Redux store is set up in store.ts with the todos slice integrated and includes a preloaded state from local storage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the Redux provider is set up in the application entry point  
  The Provider from react-redux wraps the <App /> in index.tsx, ensuring the Redux store is accessible throughout the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for all data structures  
  The code defines interfaces such as Todo and Filter under src/types, and these types are properly used in components and Redux logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows React best practices for component composition  
  Components are split logically (e.g., Header, Main, Footer, TodoItem) and reusability is maintained. Hooks are appropriately used, which adheres to best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles keyboard events properly (Enter key for creating/updating todos, Escape key for canceling edits)  
  The event handlers in NewTodoInput and TodoItem correctly manage the Enter key for submitting and editing, as well as the Escape key to cancel edits.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application maintains local storage persistence if implemented  
  Local storage persistence is implemented via loadState and saveState functions that serialize and deserialize the Redux state during store updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  There is no indication of code segments that would generate console errors or warnings. Standard error handling is implemented for local storage operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application implements proper error handling  
  Error handling is in place for local storage access (with try-catch blocks) and other operations, ensuring that exceptions are logged appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code is optimized with no unnecessary re-renders  
  The code is structured using functional components and hooks, and it leverages Redux Toolkit’s best practices, minimizing unnecessary re-renders.
