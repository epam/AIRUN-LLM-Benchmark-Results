# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist  
  The test suite defines a "Rendering" block with multiple tests such as "renders with default props" that check for the presence of core elements (SelectContainer, Control, Input, Placeholder, LiveRegion, etc.), confirming that default rendering is appropriately tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present  
  Numerous tests in the "User Interactions – Keyboard Navigation" section cover navigation using ArrowDown, ArrowUp, Enter, Escape, Tab, and other keys, confirming comprehensive keyboard interaction coverage.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)  
  The "User Interactions – Mouse Interactions" section includes tests for control clicks, dropdown indicator clicks, clear indicator clicks, and hover events, verifying that mouse interactions are thoroughly tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior  
  The tests exercise controlled behaviors (via props changes and getDerivedStateFromProps checks) as well as the default internal state management, ensuring both controlled and uncontrolled behaviors are validated.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values  
  The suite contains tests verifying changes in displayed values, value removal through keyboard (Backspace/Delete) and mouse actions as well as clearing actions, confirming proper state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented  
  Multiple tests check opening the menu (via keyboard, mouse, touch) and closing it (via Escape key, outside clicks, scroll events), which confirms the menu open/close behavior is well covered.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality  
  Tests simulate entering text into the input and then check that the correct subset of options is rendered (by verifying option labels), thus validating option filtering.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist  
  The suite includes several tests for multi-select mode such as rendering multiple selected values, handling removal through keyboard interactions, and ensuring that removing focused values works as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility  
  Tests for ARIA attributes (e.g., aria-activedescendant, aria-selected) and LiveRegion announcements confirm that accessibility features are correctly implemented and tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested  
  A dedicated test ("handles empty options array gracefully") verifies that the component properly handles an empty options set.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states  
  The suite contains tests to confirm that when isLoading is true, a LoadingMessage is rendered, and when there are no options available, a NoOptionsMessage is displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states  
  Tests check that disabled options cannot be selected and that the component does not open its menu when disabled, ensuring that disabled states are properly handled.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance  
  There is a specific "Performance (Conceptual)" block that renders a large options set (1,000 items) to ensure the component does not crash and can handle large datasets.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested  
  Multiple tests verify focus transitions during keyboard and mouse interactions, including scenarios where focus is restored or shifted between elements.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering  
  Tests validate that correct placeholders are rendered when no value is set, as well as verifying the rendering of SingleValue and MultiValue components when appropriate values are provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations  
  There are tests that validate custom formatting functions for options (formatOptionLabel) to ensure that the component uses custom label renderings in both menu and value contexts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)  
  The component’s callback props such as onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, and onMenuClose are invoked and their behavior is asserted in several tests, confirming that callbacks are properly triggered.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)  
  The test suite confirms the rendering and behavior of indicator components – DropdownIndicator, ClearIndicator, and LoadingIndicator – ensuring that these interface elements work as expected.
