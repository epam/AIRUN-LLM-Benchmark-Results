# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources
  
  The provided test suite includes thorough tests for the REST factory in `test/unit/factories/rest.spec.js`. The tests verify that all expected endpoints are defined, including blocks, blocksRequirements, comments, content, contentExtras, contentRevisions, contentRevisionsExtras, contentTags, files, filesTags, menus, modules, sitemaps, themes, settings, and users. The tests also verify the correct URL format and parameters for each resource and check that the update method is configured correctly where needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly
  
  The test suite includes proper verification of the Page factory initialization in `test/unit/factories/page.spec.js`. It validates that the Page factory returns an object with the expected properties (id, title, description, header, subheader, body, url, type, published, published_date, themePages, timestamp, extras, misc) and their initial values. It also tests that these properties can be modified.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly
  
  The test suite includes proper verification of the Users factory initialization in `test/unit/factories/users.spec.js`. It validates that the Users factory returns an object with the expected properties (id, username, name, bio, email, facebook, twitter, photo, role) and their initial values. It also tests that these properties can be modified.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods
  
  The test suite includes thorough testing for the pageCtrl controller in `test/unit/controllers/pageCtrl.spec.js`. It covers all public methods including localVersion(), deleteNewerVersion(), deletePage(), updatePageType(), titleChange(), descriptionChange(), urlChange(), saveLocal(), autocompleteTags(), selectSuggestion(), and savePage(). For each method, there are tests verifying the expected behavior and handling of edge cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller
  
  The test suite includes detailed tests for the initialization logic of the pageCtrl controller. It verifies that the controller correctly initializes $scope.page from the Page factory, sets scheduleDate to current date if needed, initializes page type correctly from Page.type or themePages, and properly checks for newer versions in localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation
  
  The test suite includes tests specifically for the titleChange function that verify URL auto-generation. It tests that URLs are auto-generated from the title if $scope.page.url is "new" or empty, that special characters and spaces are handled correctly in the auto-generated URL, and that existing custom URLs are not modified.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction
  
  The test suite includes tests for the saveLocal function that verify it correctly updates Page properties and saves them to localStorage. It specifically tests that all relevant page properties (title, description, url, publish, scheduleDate, type) are properly saved to localStorage with the appropriate key structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality
  
  The test suite includes tests for the autocompleteTags function that validate the tag suggestion functionality. It verifies that REST.contentTags.query is called with the appropriate parameters when a tag is present, that suggestions are correctly updated based on the query response, and that suggestions are cleared appropriately when no tag is present or on query error.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)
  
  The test suite includes extensive tests for the savePage function covering all conditional branches. It separates tests for new/duplicate pages and updating existing pages, and includes tests for validation logic, schedule date handling, tag management, extras handling, and success/error notifications. It validates the different API calls made in each scenario.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types
  
  The test suite covers edge cases such as empty URLs, empty page types, empty titles, and null values from localStorage. It verifies that appropriate error messages are displayed and that the savePage function returns early when validation fails. It also tests what happens when Page.extras is empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly
  
  The test suite includes tests for the deletePage function that verify it calls all necessary REST delete endpoints (content, contentRevisions, contentRevisionsExtras, contentExtras, contentTags), redirects to /new after deletion, and broadcasts a success notification. The tests use spies to verify the correct parameters are passed to each delete call.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions
  
  The test suite includes tests for handling page versions and localStorage interactions. It tests the newerVersion flag initialization, the localVersion function for restoring data from localStorage, and the deleteNewerVersion function for clearing localStorage items. It verifies that localStorage is properly cleared after use.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components
  
  While the actual coverage percentage isn't explicitly shown in the submission, the test suite is very comprehensive and covers all the factories and the controller thoroughly. The suite tests all methods, properties, and branches of the code. The karma.conf.js includes coverage configuration with preprocessors and reporters set up correctly. Based on the thoroughness of the tests, it's highly likely that the coverage exceeds 80%, though without running the tests it's not possible to verify the exact percentage.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling
  
  The test suite validates proper event broadcasting and handling. It spies on $rootScope.$broadcast to verify that the correct events are broadcast with the appropriate messages and classes. It also tests the $on("contentGet") listener to ensure it properly updates $scope.page properties from the Page factory.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality
  
  The test suite includes tests specifically for date handling and scheduling functionality. It verifies that Page.scheduleDate is used correctly, that published_date is set to the current timestamp when publishing immediately, that scheduleDate is parsed correctly for future scheduling, and that publish is set to Y if the scheduled date is in the past.
