# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)  
  The tests make clear use of Jasmine for defining specs and Karma for configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints  
  The tests include a custom mock for $resource and verify that REST endpoints are correctly configured and called.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation  
  The test suite makes extensive use of beforeEach and afterEach to set up and tear down test contexts.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls  
  The usage of $httpBackend and custom mocks ensures that no actual HTTP requests are made.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection  
  Dependencies such as $scope, $controller, $location, `$routeParams`, `$httpBackend`, and factories (Page, Users, REST) are properly injected.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations  
  Promises and asynchronous callbacks (e.g., using $translate.then and $rootScope.$digest) are handled appropriately throughout the tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies  
  The test code makes thorough use of spyOn, mocks for localStorage, $resource, and other services to replace external dependencies.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization  
  The tests are organized with nested describe and it blocks to clearly delineate different units and functionalities.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls  
  Both positive and negative test cases are addressed, ensuring that success paths and error handling for API calls are tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate  
  The tests simulate changes in input fields (like title and URL) and trigger corresponding event handlers, mimicking user interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage  
  The use of afterEach, along with explicit clearing of mocks (e.g., localStorageMock.clear()) and $httpBackend verifications, ensures proper cleanup.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested  
  Test descriptions are specific and descriptive, making it easy to understand the purpose of each test case.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible  
  The tests focus on observable outputs and behaviors (e.g., notifications, URL changes, REST calls) rather than internal implementation details.
