# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies Angular.js as the framework used
  
  The documentation consistently and correctly identifies AngularJS as the framework used throughout the document. It references AngularJS-specific components like factories, controllers, services, and directives like ng-model, ng-show, etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all factories (REST, Page, Users) are accurately documented with their purposes
  
  All three factories are thoroughly documented with their purposes clearly stated:
  - REST Factory: "Provides $resource instances for interacting with the backend REST API endpoints"
  - Page Factory: "A service acting as a global data store for the properties of the page"
  - Users Factory: "A service acting as a global data store for the currently logged-in user's information"
  
  Each factory's purpose, implementation, and interface specifications are accurately detailed.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of the Page controller and its functionality is technically accurate
  
  The documentation provides an accurate and comprehensive description of the Page controller's functionality, including initialization, event handling, state management, and key methods like savePage(), deletePage(), titleChange(), etc. The technical descriptions match AngularJS controller patterns correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the RESTful API endpoints are correctly documented
  
  The documentation includes a detailed table of all the REST API endpoints used by the application, with correct endpoint patterns and the methods they provide (query, get, save, delete, update). The endpoints cover blocks, comments, content, files, settings, users, and more.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of Angular module dependencies ($resource, $location, etc.) is correct
  
  The explanation of AngularJS module dependencies is accurate. The documentation correctly identifies and explains the use of $resource, $location, $rootScope, $routeParams, $translate, and other AngularJS built-in services correctly within their appropriate contexts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the page management features (creating, editing, deleting) are accurately described
  
  The page management features are accurately described in multiple sections, including section 2.5 (Page Creation and Saving), 2.6 (Page Deletion), and 4.3 (Common Use Cases). The documentation correctly explains the implementation details and usage of these features.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately explains how the local storage mechanism works
  
  Section 2.7 (Local Storage Recovery) accurately explains the local storage mechanism, including detection of unsaved changes, UI presentation of recovery options, and the recovery process. The documentation correctly describes the implementation details and the user interaction flow.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of form validation logic is technically accurate
  
  The form validation logic is accurately described in section 2.5 (Page Creation and Saving), which mentions validation for required fields (type, URL), checking for duplicate URLs, and ensuring title presence. The validation approach described aligns with standard AngularJS form validation patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of publish/schedule date handling is correct
  
  The documentation correctly explains the publish/schedule date handling in both sections 2.5 and 4.3, describing how the controller determines the correct published status ('Y'/'N') and calculates the published_date based on the selected option ('Publish', 'Draft', 'Schedule').

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the tag management and autocomplete feature explanation is technically accurate
  
  Section 2.9 (Tag Autocomplete) provides a technically accurate explanation of the tag management and autocomplete feature, including how the autocompleteTags function is triggered, how it queries for matching tags, how results are displayed, and how tag selection is implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the relationship between controllers, factories, and templates is accurately explained
  
  The document accurately explains the relationships between the different components. In section 1 (Overview), it clearly states the architectural role of each component and how they interact. Throughout the document, it consistently describes how the controller uses the factories and how the template binds to the controller.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation correctly identifies and explains the purpose of broadcast events
  
  The documentation correctly identifies and explains the broadcast events used in the application, particularly in section 3.4 where it lists "Events Listened" (`$rootScope.$on('contentGet',
