  The documentation provides a clear overview in section 1 that explains the purpose of the Page Management feature and its architecture. It lists the core components (REST Factory, Page Factory, Users Factory, pageCtrl Controller, page.html Template) and explains their architectural roles in the AngularJS application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all major components (REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and Page controller) are documented
  
  All major components are thoroughly documented. Section 2 provides detailed explanations of each component, and section 3 provides interface specifications with property tables for REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and pageCtrl Controller.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure all significant features of the page management system are described
  
  The documentation thoroughly covers all significant features of the page management system, including REST API interaction, page state management, user state management, page editing interface, page creation and saving, page deletion, local storage recovery, URL auto-generation, and tag autocomplete functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all form inputs and their behavior are documented
  
  The documentation describes all form inputs and their behavior throughout sections 2 and 4. Section 2.4 specifically covers the page editing interface, and sections 2.8 and 2.9 cover behavior like URL auto-generation and tag autocomplete. Section 4.3 describes common use cases that explain how the various form inputs are used.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify the documentation explains the page versioning and revision system
  
  The documentation explains the revision system in section 2.5 (Page Creation and Saving), detailing how revisions are saved using REST.contentRevisions and how extras are associated with revisions using REST.contentRevisionsExtras. However, it could be more explicit about how users access or manage previous revisions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation covers the tag system and autocomplete functionality
  
  Section 2.9 is dedicated specifically to the tag autocomplete functionality, detailing how it's implemented, how it suggests existing tags, and how users can select from suggestions. The implementation and interface are well-documented.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes explanation of error handling and user notifications
  
  The documentation explains error handling and user notifications throughout. Section 2.5 details how the system "Broadcasts success or error notifications using $rootScope.$broadcast('notify', ...)". Similar explanations appear for other operations like page deletion.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page publishing workflow including scheduling
  
  The documentation clearly explains the publishing workflow in section 2.5, describing how the system handles the different publishing options ("Publish", "Draft", "Schedule"). Section 4.3 also includes a specific use case for scheduling a page with details about how the scheduling process works.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation details how content extras and additional metadata are managed
  
  The documentation explains how extras are managed in section 2.5, detailing how the system "Deletes existing extras (on update), then saves current extras (Page.extras) using REST.contentExtras".

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation explains how the UI interacts with the backend APIs
  
  The documentation thoroughly explains how the UI interacts with backend APIs. Section 2.1 details the REST Factory that centralizes all API communication, and subsequent sections explain how different UI components use this factory to interact with the backend.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes sample usage examples or patterns
  
  Section 4 is dedicated to usage documentation, with section 4.2 providing a sample route configuration and section 4.3 detailing common use cases like creating a new page, editing an existing page, duplicating a page, deleting a page, scheduling a page, and recovering unsaved changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains all significant event broadcasting and inter-component communication
