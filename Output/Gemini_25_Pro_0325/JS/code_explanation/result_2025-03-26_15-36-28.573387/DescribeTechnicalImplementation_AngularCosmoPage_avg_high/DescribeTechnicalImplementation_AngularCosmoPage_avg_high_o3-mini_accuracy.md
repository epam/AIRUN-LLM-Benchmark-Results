# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies Angular.js as the framework used  
  The documentation repeatedly and correctly refers to AngularJS throughout, making it clear that Angular.js is the underlying framework.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all factories (REST, Page, Users) are accurately documented with their purposes  
  The provided documentation clearly outlines the purpose and implementation details of the REST, Page, and Users factories, accurately describing their roles in API communication and state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of the Page controller and its functionality is technically accurate  
  The description of the pageCtrl controller covers its responsibilities, data binding, event handling, and interaction with factories, which aligns with standard AngularJS application design.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the RESTful API endpoints are correctly documented  
  Each RESTful API endpoint is detailed with the correct path and methods (including the custom PUT updates), which is consistent with the expected functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of Angular module dependencies ($resource, $location, etc.) is correct  
  The dependencies are clearly identified and the documentation explains their roles (e.g., $resource for API interactions and $location for redirection) correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the page management features (creating, editing, deleting) are accurately described  
  The documentation accurately describes the processes for creating, editing, duplicating, and deleting pages, including how user interactions trigger these operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately explains how the local storage mechanism works  
  The explanation covers detection, recovery, and deletion of unsaved page changes via localStorage, providing a clear understanding of this feature.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of form validation logic is technically accurate  
  The documentation details the validation steps within the savePage function (e.g., checking required fields, duplicate URLs, fallback title assignments) in a manner consistent with typical AngularJS practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of publish/schedule date handling is correct  
  The documentation correctly explains how the published status, publish options (Publish, Draft, Schedule), and published_date are handled within the page saving process.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the tag management and autocomplete feature explanation is technically accurate  
  Tag autocomplete is described precisely, including the use of ng-change, API querying via REST.contentTags, and the handling of suggestions through ng-repeat.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the relationship between controllers, factories, and templates is accurately explained  
  The documentation establishes the connection between pageCtrl, the related templates (page.html), and shared factories (Page, Users, REST), clarifying their interactions within the AngularJS structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation correctly identifies and explains the purpose of broadcast events  
  Broadcast events such as $rootScope.$broadcast('notify', â€¦) are well-explained in terms of triggering notifications and other application-wide interactions, which is accurate.
