- **Pass** (100%): Check that all form inputs and their behavior are documented  
  The behavior of form inputs is discussed in the context of the `page.html` template and the associated controller functions (e.g., for title, URL, and tag inputs).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page versioning and revision system  
  The documentation details how the `savePage` function handles promise chaining to create new revisions and manage associated data, which indicates a clear handling of page revisions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation covers the tag system and autocomplete functionality

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation explains how the UI interacts with the backend APIs  
  There is a clear description of how the UI, through the controller and the factories, interacts with the backend using AngularJSâ€™s `$resource` and the defined REST API endpoints.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes sample usage examples or patterns  
  The documentation contains sample route configuration code and usage patterns, especially in the routing and initialization sections.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains all significant event broadcasting and inter-component communication
