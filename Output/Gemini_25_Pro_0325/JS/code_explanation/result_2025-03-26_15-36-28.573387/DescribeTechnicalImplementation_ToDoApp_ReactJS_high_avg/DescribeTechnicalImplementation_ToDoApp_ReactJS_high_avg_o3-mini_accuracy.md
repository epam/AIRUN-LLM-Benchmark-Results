- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all props are documented with their names, types, and descriptions  
  Each component section includes a table that clearly lists prop names, types, whether they are required, and a description of each.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation clearly distinguishes between required and optional props  
  The props tables include a “Required” column which makes the distinction between required and optional props explicit.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component's state management approach is accurately documented  
  The documentation explains the state properties for components like TodoApp and TodoItem including their types, purposes, and initial values.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that sample code snippets demonstrate proper implementation of the components  
  Sample usage code is included for components (e.g., in TodoApp.render) showing how each component is implemented and integrated.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the documentation explains all ARIA roles and attributes implemented in the components  
  Although there is mention of accessibility features and a note suggesting the addition of an ARIA label for the delete button, the documentation does not provide a comprehensive explanation of all ARIA roles and attributes used.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation describes how the components support assistive technologies  
  The documentation details accessibility features such as semantic HTML elements, usage of labels, keyboard navigation hints, and focus management, which support assistive technologies.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that keyboard navigation support and focus management are explained in the documentation  
  The document explains how keyboard actions (Enter and Escape keys) are handled in the edit mode and describes focus management via lifecycle methods and input autoFocus.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that performance optimizations like shouldComponentUpdate are documented with explanations  
  The documentation explicitly mentions and explains the use of shouldComponentUpdate in the TodoItem component for performance optimization.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that component lifecycle methods are explained with their purposes  
  Lifecycle methods such as componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate are described in context, including how they handle tasks like setting up routing and managing focus.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that any dependencies or requirements are noted in the documentation  
  Dependencies such as React, ReactDOM, classnames, and the director router library are noted, and the roles of utility modules and constants are explained.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation uses clear section headings and consistent formatting  
  The document is well-organized with clearly labeled sections, headings, and subheadings, providing a logical structure throughout.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that tables are used for structured data like props  
  Relevant sections make effective use of tables to present prop details including names, types, whether they are required, and their descriptions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all technical terms are used accurately throughout the documentation  
  The technical language is accurate and consistent, and all key concepts (like immutability, unidirectional data flow, and lifecycle methods) are appropriately explained.
