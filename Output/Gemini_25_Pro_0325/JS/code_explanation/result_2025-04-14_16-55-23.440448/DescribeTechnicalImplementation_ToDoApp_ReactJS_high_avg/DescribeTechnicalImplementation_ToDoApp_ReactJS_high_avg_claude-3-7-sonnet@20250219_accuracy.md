- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all props are documented with their names, types, and descriptions
  
  The documentation includes detailed tables for all props, consistently showing names, types, and descriptions for each component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation clearly distinguishes between required and optional props

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the documentation explains all ARIA roles and attributes implemented in the components

  The TodoItem's implementation details section specifically mentions and explains its use of shouldComponentUpdate as a performance optimization.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that component lifecycle methods are explained with their purposes
  
  All lifecycle methods used (componentDidMount, shouldComponentUpdate, componentDidUpdate) are documented with clear explanations of their purposes within each component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that any dependencies or requirements are noted in the documentation
  
  Each component's "Implementation Details" section lists its dependencies (react, react-dom, director, classnames, etc.).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation uses clear section headings and consistent formatting
  
  The documentation maintains consistent structure throughout with clear headings (Overview, Key Features, Props, State, etc.) and consistent formatting.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that tables are used for structured data like props
  
  All structured data (props, state) is presented in well-formatted tables with clear headers and aligned columns.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all technical terms are used accurately throughout the documentation
  
  Technical terms like "props", "state", "lifecycle methods", "immutability", and React-specific concepts are used accurately and consistently throughout the documentation.
