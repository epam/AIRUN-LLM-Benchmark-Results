# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x
  
  The component uses React 18 features like `useId()` hook, which was introduced in React 18. Also, it imports from 'react' and uses the FC (FunctionComponent) type which is compatible with React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
  
  The code has proper TypeScript definitions in a separate types.ts file with well-defined interfaces for Props and Options. All components, state variables, refs, and functions use appropriate TypeScript typings.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling
  
  The component includes a comprehensive CSS file with appropriate styles for all component parts, including hover states, active states, and focus management.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments
  
  The code doesn't contain any TODO comments or debugging code. The implementation is clean and ready for production use.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility
  
  The component properly uses useState hooks for managing:
  - `isOpen` for dropdown visibility
  - `searchTerm` for the search input value
  - `activeIndex` for keyboard navigation
  
  The selected value is managed via props in a controlled component pattern.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props
  
  The component accepts numerous props for customization:
  - id
  - options
  - value
  - onChange
  - placeholder
  - label
  - className
  
  These props allow the component to be reused in different contexts with different data and styling.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection
  
  The component implements comprehensive keyboard navigation:
  - Arrow keys for moving through options
  - Enter/Space for selection
  - Escape for closing dropdown
  - Tab management for focus
  - Character keys for searching

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions
  
  The component uses useRef appropriately for accessing DOM elements like the container, trigger button, search input, and options list. DOM interactions are handled through React's event system and refs when necessary.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques
  
  The component manages focus correctly by:
  - Returning focus to the trigger when dropdown closes
  - Moving focus to search input when dropdown opens
  - Using aria-activedescendant for virtual focus within the listbox
  - Properly handling tabbing out of the component

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
  
  The component uses numerous ARIA attributes for accessibility:
  - aria-haspopup
  - aria-expanded
  - aria-controls
  - aria-activedescendant
  - aria-labelledby
  - role="listbox" and role="option"
  - aria-selected
  - aria-autocomplete
  
  These attributes make the component fully accessible to screen readers and keyboard users.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  The code appears to be free of console errors and warnings. However, there's one potential issue: In the component, the trigger's aria-activedescendant is set when the dropdown is open but activeIndex might be -1 (which means no active item). In that case, the activeDescendantId would be undefined, which is correct but might need explicit handling.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component
  
  The component uses useCallback for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Dependencies are properly listed in the dependency arrays of useCallback and useEffect hooks. The only potential optimization could be memoizing the filteredOptions calculation with useMemo, but this is likely unnecessary unless the options list is very large.
