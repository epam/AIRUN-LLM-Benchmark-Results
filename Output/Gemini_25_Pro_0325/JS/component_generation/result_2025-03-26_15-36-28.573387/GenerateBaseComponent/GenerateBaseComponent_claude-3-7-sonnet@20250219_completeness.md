# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element
  
  The provided code clearly implements a dropdown select UI element in the `SearchableSelect` component, with a trigger button and a dropdown containing options. The UI structure is well-defined with proper CSS styling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown
  
  The code includes a search input within the dropdown, implemented in lines 234-246 of the `SearchableSelect.tsx` file. The input is properly referenced using `searchInputRef` and has appropriate event handlers for managing the search term.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown
  
  The component implements single item selection through the `handleOptionClick` function, which calls the `onChange` prop with the selected value and then closes the dropdown. The selected value is maintained in the parent component and passed back to display the selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys
  
  The component handles keyboard navigation with the arrow keys in the `handleKeyDown` function (lines 149-154 for ArrowDown and 156-161 for ArrowUp). These properly update the `activeIndex` state to move through the filtered options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key
  
  The code handles Enter key selection in lines 134-143 of the `handleKeyDown` function, where it calls `handleOptionClick` with the value of the currently active option when Enter is pressed while an option is active.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused
  
  The component toggles dropdown visibility with the Enter key in the `handleKeyDown` function (lines 131-143). When the dropdown is closed, pressing Enter opens it; when it's open, pressing Enter either selects the active option or closes the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes
  
  The `closeDropdown` function (lines 105-111) explicitly returns focus to the trigger button after closing the dropdown with `triggerRef.current?.focus()`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click
  
  The `handleOptionClick` function (lines 125-128) is called when an option is clicked, and it properly closes the dropdown by calling `closeDropdown()` after setting the selected value.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard
  
  In the `handleKeyDown` function (lines 134-143), when Enter is pressed and an item is active, `handleOptionClick` is called, which closes the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed
  
  The `handleKeyDown` function handles the Escape key in lines 145-149, properly calling `closeDropdown()` when Escape is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component
  
  The component implements an effect (lines 194-205) that adds a document-level event listener for `mousedown` events and calls `closeDropdown()` when a click is detected outside the component's container.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused
  
  The `handleKeyDown` function handles the Enter key in lines 131-143. When the dropdown is not open (`!isOpen`), pressing Enter calls `openDropdown()` to open the dropdown.
