# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  The component imports and uses React hooks including useId, which is a feature introduced in React 18. This indicates the implementation is aligned with React 18.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  All files (e.g., SearchableSelect.tsx and types.ts) are written in TypeScript and include detailed type definitions for props, state, and event handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  The implementation clearly provides an “index.css” file that defines the component’s styling principles and class names.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  The code is well-organized, documented, and free of placeholder comments or TODOs, showcasing production-ready quality.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  State is managed through useState hooks for controlling dropdown visibility, search term, and active index, which is the standard and recommended approach.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  The component accepts several customizable props (id, options, value, onChange, placeholder, label, className) making it highly reusable in different contexts.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  The onKeyDown handler supports navigation (ArrowUp, ArrowDown), selection (Enter, Space), and closure (Escape, Tab), ensuring comprehensive keyboard accessibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  The implementation uses useRef to handle focus management, click-outside detection, and scrolling into view for the active option, meeting React best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  Focus is correctly managed by shifting focus to the search input when the dropdown opens and returning focus to the trigger button when it closes.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  Numerous ARIA attributes (aria-haspopup, aria-expanded, aria-controls, aria-activedescendant, aria-label, role attributes) are set properly, ensuring that the component is accessible.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  The component is well written and follows best practices; however, since runtime behavior is not observable here, there is a slight uncertainty regarding potential environment-specific warnings (e.g., in different browsers or with strict linting settings).

- **Pass** (90%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  The use of useCallback hooks and proper dependency management suggests that the component minimizes unnecessary re-renders. While the implementation appears optimized, without runtime performance tests there remains a minor level of uncertainty.
