# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component renders a container along with a trigger button and conditionally displays a dropdown, which meets the UI element requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  The dropdown includes an input element with type "text" dedicated to searching options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The component is designed as a controlled single-select component with a selected value and corresponding option highlighting.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The implementation explicitly handles "ArrowDown" and "ArrowUp" keys to update and wrap the active index, enabling keyboard navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  The keydown handler checks for the "Enter" key and, when an option is active, selects it by invoking the click handler for that option.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  The Enter key (and space) toggles the dropdownâ€™s visibility via the toggleDropdown function when the component is focused.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  The closeDropdown function explicitly returns focus to the trigger button, ensuring the focus behavior is maintained.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  A mouse click on an option calls the handleOptionClick function which selects the item and subsequently closes the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  The Enter key press on an active (highlighted) option calls handleOptionClick, and the dropdown is closed as part of that process.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  The keydown event handler listens for the "Escape" key and calls closeDropdown, closing the dropdown accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  An effect adds an event listener to the document to detect clicks outside of the component, ensuring correct dropdown closure.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  When the component is focused and the Enter key is pressed (with the dropdown closed), the handler calls openDropdown, which opens the dropdown.
