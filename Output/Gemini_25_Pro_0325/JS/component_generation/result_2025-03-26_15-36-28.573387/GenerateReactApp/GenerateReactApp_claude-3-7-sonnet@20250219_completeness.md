# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The application correctly fetches Star Wars characters using Axios from the SWAPI endpoint (`https://swapi.dev/api/people`) and displays them in a list. The data fetching is implemented in the `useEffect` hook and the character data is stored in the `characters` state variable.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The application implements a loading state with the `isLoading` state variable, which is set to `true` when the API call begins and `false` when it completes. During loading, the `renderContent` function returns a loading indicator: `<div className="loading-indicator">Loading characters...</div>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The application maps through all characters in the `characters` state array and renders each one in a list item. The code uses `characters.map((character) => (<li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>))` to ensure all fetched characters are displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  The provided code does not include any search functionality or user input fields. The application only fetches and displays Star Wars characters without any filtering or search capabilities.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character is displayed in a list item showing the character's name: `<li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>`. The character name is correctly accessed from the `name` property of each character object.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The code explicitly mentions using Create React App with TypeScript in the setup instructions: `npx create-react-app swapi-char-list --template typescript`. The package.json structure also matches what would be generated by Create React App.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The application implements proper state management using React's useState hook:
  - `const [characters, setCharacters] = useState<Character[]>([]);`
  - `const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState<boolean>(true);`
  - `const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);`
  
  These states are correctly updated during the data fetching process and used appropriately for conditional rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each list item has the `character.url` as its key, which should be unique for each character as noted in the comment: `// Using character.url as key since it's unique per character`. This ensures optimal rendering by React.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  The application checks for an empty character list with `if (characters.length === 0) { return <p>No characters found.</p>; }`. This ensures that a meaningful message is displayed when no characters are found, rather than showing an empty list.
