# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses React 18.x or newer by checking the package.json dependencies  
  The package.json includes React version "^18.3.1", which confirms the use of React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that TypeScript is properly implemented with appropriate type definitions for all components, props, and states  
  The solution defines a dedicated types file (src/types/swapi.ts) for the API response and character, and the App component correctly uses TypeScript generics with useState and axios.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Axios is used for API requests to fetch data from the Star Wars API endpoint  
  Axios is imported and used in the fetchCharacters function with a typed response from the SWAPI endpoint.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles API errors gracefully with appropriate error states or messages  
  The try/catch within the async function handles errors, sets an error state, and the rendered output displays a friendly error message.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the character data is fetched on component mount using the useEffect hook  
  The useEffect hook is provided with an empty dependency array, ensuring that the data is fetched only once on mount.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application properly manages component rendering optimization  
  The component leverages state management and conditional rendering without unnecessary re-renders. Although no advanced optimization technique is used, the basic approach is sufficient for this application.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows React best practices using hooks appropriately  
  The code uses functional components, hooks (useState, useEffect), and keys for list rendering in accordance with React best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't contain any TODO comments or unnecessary code  
  The provided code is clean, with only necessary comments and no TODO notes or extraneous code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the API endpoint 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' is being called correctly  
  The API endpoint URL is correctly defined and used in the axios GET request.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application renders without console errors or warnings  
  Based on the code review, there are no obvious issues that would lead to console errors or warnings, and the error handling indicates awareness of potential issues.
