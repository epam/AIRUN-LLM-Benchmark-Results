# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name
    
    The solution includes a clearly defined search input field with proper attributes:
    ```jsx
    <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="Search characters by name..."
        value={searchTerm}
        onChange={handleSearchChange}
        style={styles.input}
        aria-label="Search Star Wars Characters"
    />
    ```
    This input is connected to the search logic via the `searchTerm` state and `handleSearchChange` function, which ultimately filters characters by name through the SWAPI API endpoint.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests
    
    The solution implements a loading state and displays a loading indicator:
    ```jsx
    {loading && <div style={styles.feedback}>Loading...</div>}
    ```
    The loading state is properly managed in the `fetchCharacters` function, being set to `true` at the beginning of the request and to `false` in the `finally` block when the request completes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query
    
    The solution correctly loads initial data on component mount through the useEffect hook:
    ```jsx
    useEffect(() => {
        // Send an initial empty search query on component mount (debouncedSearchTerm starts as '')
        // And subsequent searches based on debounced term
        fetchCharacters(debouncedSearchTerm);
    }, [debouncedSearchTerm, fetchCharacters]);
    ```
    Since `debouncedSearchTerm` starts as an empty string, this triggers an initial fetch with an empty query when the component mounts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type
    
    The solution implements debouncing with the custom `useDebounce` hook:
    ```jsx
    const debouncedSearchTerm = useDebounce(searchTerm, 500); // 500ms delay
    ```
    This ensures that search results update dynamically after the user stops typing for 500ms, preventing excessive API calls while still providing responsive feedback.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found
    
    The solution provides clear visual feedback when no results are found:
    ```jsx
    {!loading && !error && characters.length === 0 && debouncedSearchTerm && (
        <div style={styles.feedback}>No characters found matching "{debouncedSearchTerm}".</div>
    )}
    ```
    This message appears only when appropriate (not loading, no error, empty results, and a search term has been entered).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design
    
    The solution includes responsive design principles:
    ```jsx
    const styles: { [key: string]: React.CSSProperties } = {
        container: {
            fontFamily: 'Arial, sans-serif',
            maxWidth: '600px',
            margin: '20px auto',
            padding: '20px',
            /* other styles */
        },
        input: {
            width: 'calc(100% - 22px)', // Account for padding/border
            /* other styles */
        },
        /* other style definitions */
    };
    ```
    The use of percentage-based widths, max-width, and auto margins contributes to a responsive design that will adapt to different screen sizes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response
    
    The solution properly renders the list of characters from the API response:
    ```jsx
    {!loading && !error && characters.length > 0 && (
        <ul style={styles.list}>
            {characters.map((character) => (
                <li key={character.url} style={styles.listItem}>
                    {character.name}
                </li>
            ))}
        </ul>
    )}
    ```
    Each character is displayed in a list item with proper key assignment using the character URL as a unique identifier.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed
    
    The solution implements error handling for API requests:
    ```jsx
    try {
        const response = await axios.get
