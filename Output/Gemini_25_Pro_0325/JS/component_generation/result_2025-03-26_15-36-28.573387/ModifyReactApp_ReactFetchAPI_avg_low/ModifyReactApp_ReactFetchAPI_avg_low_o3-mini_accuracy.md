# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type  
  The input element uses an onChange handler (handleSearchChange) which updates the searchTerm state correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls  
  The custom hook useDebounce is used with a 500ms delay, which is within the specified 300-500ms range.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured  
  The code uses axios.get to fetch data from the API, and the error handling logic utilizes axios.isAxiosError appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses  
  All components and functions are strongly typed using interfaces for Character and SwapiPeopleResponse. State variables and function parameters are correctly typed.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters  
  The API URL is correctly constructed by appending a search query parameter when provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate  
  Performance optimizations are applied using useCallback for both fetchCharacters and handleSearchChange to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback  
  The try-catch block in fetchCharacters catches errors, logs them, sets an appropriate error message, and the UI reflects these error states.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing  
  API calls depend on the debouncedSearchTerm via useEffect, ensuring they are triggered only after the user stops typing (after the 500ms delay).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices  
  The use of useState and useEffect for managing the component's state adheres to common React best practices.

- **Pass** (95%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code  
  The provided code is clean and well-organized. While no runtime testing is performed here, a careful review did not reveal any obvious issues. The slight deduction is due to the inability to verify runtime behavior without execution.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests  
  The loading state is accurately managed by setting it to true at the start of an API call and to false in the finally block, ensuring proper handling around asynchronous requests.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns  
  The implementation using functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback) aligns with React 18.x best practices.
