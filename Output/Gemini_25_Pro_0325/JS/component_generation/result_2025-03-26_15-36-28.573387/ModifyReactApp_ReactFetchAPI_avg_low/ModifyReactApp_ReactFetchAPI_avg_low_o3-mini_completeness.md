# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The component renders an input element with the placeholder "Search characters by name..." that is used to update the search query.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  The code sets and uses the "loading" state and displays "Loading..." when an API request is in progress.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  On mount, the debounced search term is initialized to an empty string (''), triggering a call to fetchCharacters with an empty query, which loads the initial data.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  The useDebounce hook and the useEffect that listens to the debounced search term ensure that API calls are made dynamically as the user enters text.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  When the search term is non-empty and the characters array is empty (with no ongoing loading or error), the component displays a message indicating that no characters were found.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The inline styles (e.g., "maxWidth: 600px" and "width: calc(100% - 22px)") help ensure that the component adapts to different screen sizes. However, since this is a basic implementation using inline CSS, it may require further enhancements (such as media queries or dedicated responsive styling techniques) to be fully responsive across all devices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  The component maps over the "characters" state and renders a list of character names when the API response contains data.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  While the component handles API errors via state (using try-catch in the fetchCharacters function), it does not include a dedicated React ErrorBoundary component to catch rendering errors in its children. The evaluation criteria call for explicit error boundaries where appropriate, so this aspect is considered incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The code includes TypeScript interfaces (e.g., Character and SwapiPeopleResponse) to strongly type the API response data as well as component state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The solution adds search functionality without removing existing behavior. The initial empty search triggers a data load, and subsequent searches dynamically update the displayed characters, maintaining the core data-fetching functionality.
