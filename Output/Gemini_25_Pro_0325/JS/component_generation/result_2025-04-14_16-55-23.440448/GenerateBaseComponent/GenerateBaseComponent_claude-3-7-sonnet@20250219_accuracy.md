# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x
  
  The implementation uses modern React with hooks such as `useState`, `useRef`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`, and `useId`. The use of `useId` specifically indicates this is React 18.x, as this hook was introduced in React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
  
  The code is written in TypeScript with clear type definitions. It includes properly defined interfaces (`OptionType`, `SearchableSelectProps`), typed function parameters, and typed state variables. Type annotations are used throughout the component for refs, event handlers, and props.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling
  
  The implementation includes a comprehensive `index.css` file with styles for all component elements including states like disabled, hover, focus, etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments
  
  The code is clean, well-structured, and free of TODO comments. It includes appropriate comments for code clarity but no development-stage TODOs or placeholder comments.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility
  
  The component properly manages state using React hooks:
  - `useState` for dropdown visibility (`isOpen`)
  - `useState` for search input value (`searchTerm`)
  - `useState` for highlighted option index (`highlightedIndex`)
  - The selected value is managed externally and passed as a prop, following the controlled component pattern

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props
  
  The component accepts various props for customization:
  - `options`: Array of selectable options
  - `value`: Currently selected value
  - `onChange`: Handler for selection changes
  - `placeholder`: Custom placeholder text
  - `id`: Optional external ID
  - `label`: Optional label text
  - `disabled`: Option to disable the component

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection
  
  The component implements comprehensive keyboard navigation:
  - Arrow keys for navigating through options
  - Enter for opening dropdown and selecting highlighted option
  - Escape for closing dropdown
  - Tab for naturally moving focus in/out of component
  - The `handleKeyDown` function is well-structured with a switch statement for different key events

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions
  
  The component uses refs appropriately:
  - `containerRef` for detecting clicks outside the component
  - `triggerRef` for managing focus on the trigger button
  - `listboxRef` for the options container
  - `searchInputRef` for managing focus on the search input
  - `optionRefs` for scrolling highlighted options into view
  - DOM manipulations are properly handled within effect hooks

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques
  
  Focus management is properly implemented:
  - Focus moves to search input when dropdown opens
  - Focus returns to trigger button when dropdown closes
  - Keyboard navigation properly highlights options
  - Highlighted options are scrolled into view

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
  
  The component uses extensive ARIA attributes:
  - `role="combobox"` on the trigger button
  - `aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls` on the trigger
  - `aria-activedescendant` to indicate highlighted option
  - `role="listbox"` on the options container
  - `role="option"` and `aria-selected` on individual options
  - Proper ID associations with `useId` hook
  - `aria-label` and `aria-autocomplete` on search input

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  There are no explicit console errors or warnings in the code. All React dependencies are properly declared in effect hooks, and all variables are properly initialized and typed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component
  
  The component efficiently prevents unnecessary re-renders:
  - `useMemo` for filtering options based on search term
  - `useCallback` for event handlers
  - Effects have proper dependency arrays
  - `useRef` is used correctly for values that shouldn't trigger re-renders
