# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element
    
    The code clearly implements a dropdown select UI element with a button trigger that displays the selected value or placeholder text. The button has a down/up arrow indicator, and when clicked, it displays the dropdown panel with options.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown
    
    The code includes a search input field within the dropdown. It's rendered when the dropdown is open and has functionality to filter the options based on the search term.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown
    
    The component maintains a single selection through the `value` prop and `onChange` callback. The selected item is highlighted differently, and clicking or pressing Enter on an option selects it and updates the value.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys
    
    The component implements keyboard navigation with arrow keys in the `handleKeyDown` function. The ArrowDown and ArrowUp keys change the highlighted index, and the component scrolls the highlighted option into view.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key
    
    The handleKeyDown function handles the Enter key to select the currently highlighted option when the dropdown is open, calling the handleSelectOption function with the selected option.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused
    
    The Enter key behavior in the handleKeyDown function toggles the dropdown open if it's closed, and selects an option if it's open with a highlighted item.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes
    
    When the dropdown closes (through Escape key, item selection, or clicking outside), focus returns to the trigger button via `triggerRef.current?.focus()`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click
    
    The handleOptionClick function calls handleSelectOption which sets isOpen to false when an item is clicked with the mouse.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard
    
    In the handleKeyDown function, when Enter is pressed and an option is highlighted, handleSelectOption is called which closes the dropdown by setting isOpen to false.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed
    
    The handleKeyDown function includes a case for the Escape key that sets isOpen to false when the dropdown is open.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component
    
    The component adds an event listener for mousedown events on the document, and in the handleClickOutside function, it checks if the click was outside the component container and closes the dropdown if it was.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused
    
    In the handleKeyDown function's Enter key case, if the dropdown is not open, it sets isOpen to true, which opens the dropdown.
