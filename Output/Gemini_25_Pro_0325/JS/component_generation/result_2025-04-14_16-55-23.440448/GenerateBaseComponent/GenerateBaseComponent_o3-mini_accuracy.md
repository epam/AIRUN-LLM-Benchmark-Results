# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  The implementation uses modern React function components, hooks, and TypeScript. Although the specific React version isnâ€™t stated, the usage pattern aligns well with React 18.x features.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  The code includes TypeScript interfaces (such as OptionType and SearchableSelectProps) and type annotations throughout the code, clearly indicating proper usage of TypeScript.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  An index.css file is provided and imported appropriately in the component, ensuring that styling rules are centralized.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  The code is well-organized, includes clear comments for clarity, and contains no residual TODO comments. There is a commented-out optional enhancement block, which is acceptable as it explains potential further improvements.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  The component manages dropdown visibility, search term, and highlighted index with useState, providing clear and efficient state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  The component accepts several customizable props (options, value, onChange, placeholder, label, id, disabled) making it reusable in different contexts.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  The implementation handles key events like Enter, Escape, ArrowDown, ArrowUp, and Tab appropriately, ensuring a robust keyboard navigation experience.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  The code uses useRef for DOM elements and manages event listeners (e.g., click outside detection) effectively following React best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  Focus management is clearly implemented: focusing the search input when the dropdown opens and returning focus to the trigger when the dropdown closes enhances usability and accessibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  Based on the provided code structure and practices (using TypeScript, proper dependency arrays in useEffect, etc.), the code appears well-maintained and free of issues that would cause console errors or warnings.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  The use of useMemo and useCallback to memoize values and event handlers is appropriate, which minimizes unnecessary re-renders and optimizes performance.
