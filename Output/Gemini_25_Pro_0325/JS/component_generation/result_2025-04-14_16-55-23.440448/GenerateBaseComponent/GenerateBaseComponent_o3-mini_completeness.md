# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component renders a button acting as the trigger and conditionally displays a dropdown list (the UL element) when open.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  The dropdown contains an input element (referenced as searchInputRef) that allows the user to filter options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The component accepts a single selected option via the "value" prop and calls onChange with a single OptionType or null.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The keydown event handler listens for ArrowDown and ArrowUp keys to adjust the highlighted index, allowing keyboard navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  When open, pressing Enter checks for a highlighted option and selects it via handleSelectOption.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  If the dropdown is closed, pressing Enter will open it. Conversely, when an option is selected or no option is highlighted, Enter triggers the dropdown to close.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  The code calls triggerRef.current?.focus() after selecting an option or pressing Escape, ensuring the focus returns to the trigger element.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  In the onClick handler for each option, handleOptionClick is invoked which calls handleSelectOption and then closes the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  When an option is highlighted and the Enter key is pressed, the dropdown is closed after selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  The keydown handler includes logic for the Escape key, which closes the dropdown and resets focus back to the trigger.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  A click listener on the document detects clicks outside the component and closes the dropdown appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  When focused and closed, pressing Enter opens the dropdown as per the logic defined in the keydown handler.
