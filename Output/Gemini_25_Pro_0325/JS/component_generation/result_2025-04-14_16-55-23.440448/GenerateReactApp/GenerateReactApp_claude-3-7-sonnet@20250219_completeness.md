# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
    
    The code fetches Star Wars characters from the SWAPI endpoint (`https://swapi.dev/api/people`) using Axios and displays them in a list when the data is successfully loaded.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
    
    The code includes conditional rendering for the loading state:
    ```typescript
    if (loading) {
      return <div className="loading-indicator">Loading characters...</div>;
    }
    ```
    The loading state is properly managed, setting it to true initially and before fetch operations, and to false after fetch completion.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
    
    The code maps through all characters received from the API response and renders them in a list:
    ```typescript
    {characters.map((character) => (
      <li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>
    ))}
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
    
    The code does not implement any search functionality or user input fields. It simply fetches and displays the character list.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
    
    Each character is displayed with its name as shown in the mapping function:
    ```typescript
    <li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
    
    The implementation starts with instructions to create a new project using Create React App with TypeScript:
    ```bash
    npx create-react-app swapi-char-list --template typescript
    ```
    Also, the package.json structure and dependencies match those of a Create React App project.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
    
    The application correctly manages three state variables:
    ```typescript
    const [characters, setCharacters] = useState<Character[]>([]);
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(true);
    const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);
    ```
    These states are properly updated during the component lifecycle and API interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
    
    Each list item has a unique key derived from the character's URL:
    ```typescript
    <li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>
    ```
    The code even includes a comment explaining why this is a reliable choice:
    ```typescript
    // Using the unique 'url' from SWAPI as the key is reliable
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
    
    The application has a specific condition for handling empty data:
    ```typescript
    if (characters.length === 0) {
      return <div>No characters found.</div>;
    }
    ```
