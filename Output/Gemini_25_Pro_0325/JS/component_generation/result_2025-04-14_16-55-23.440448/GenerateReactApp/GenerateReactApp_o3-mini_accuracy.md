# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses React 18.x or newer by checking the package.json dependencies  
  The package.json clearly lists "react" and "react-dom" with versions such as "^18.3.1", confirming the usage of React 18.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that TypeScript is properly implemented with appropriate type definitions for all components, props, and states  
  The code uses .tsx files, relevant interfaces (such as Character and SwapiResponse), and React.FC where applicable. Although the App component is defined as a plain function without an explicit React.FC annotation, TypeScript is still effectively applied throughout the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Axios is used for API requests to fetch data from the Star Wars API endpoint  
  The code uses Axios (imported from 'axios') and makes a GET request to the provided endpoint (https://swapi.dev/api/people).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles API errors gracefully with appropriate error states or messages  
  A try-catch block handles errors; if an error occurs, an error message is set in the state and displayed. Additionally, the error is logged to the console for debugging purposes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the character data is fetched on component mount using the useEffect hook  
  The useEffect hook with an empty dependency array ensures that data fetching occurs only once when the component mounts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application properly manages component rendering optimization  
  The code employs a cleanup function in useEffect (using an "isMounted" flag) to prevent state updates on an unmounted component, which is a good practice to avoid unnecessary renders or errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows React best practices using hooks appropriately  
  Hooks such as useState and useEffect are employed correctly for state management and side effects, adhering to common React best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't contain any TODO comments or unnecessary code  
  The provided code is free from TODO comments or extraneous/unnecessary code, keeping the implementation clean.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the codebase has minimal comments that only clarify complex logic when necessary  
  The comments present in the code are concise and serve to explain non-trivial parts, without cluttering the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the API endpoint 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' is being called correctly  
  The API endpoint is set as a constant (API_ENDPOINT) and utilized correctly within the Axios GET request.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application renders without console errors or warnings  
  The implementation is clean, and there are no indicators of console errors or warnings in the provided code. (Note: While runtime behavior cannot be fully verified without executing the code, the static code analysis suggests that it is well-structured.)
