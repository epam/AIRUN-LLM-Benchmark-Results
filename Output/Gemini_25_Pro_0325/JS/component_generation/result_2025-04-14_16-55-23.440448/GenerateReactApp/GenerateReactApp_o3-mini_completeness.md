# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The code fetches data from the SWAPI endpoint and maps the results to list items, ensuring the characters are displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The component conditionally renders a div with the text "Loading characters..." when the loading state is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  All fetched characters are stored in the state and then rendered using the map function, ensuring the entire list is displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  The implementation focuses solely on fetching and displaying a list of characters; there are no search inputs or user interactive fields present.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each list item is rendered with the character’s name (i.e., {character.name}), fulfilling the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The instructions detail the use of Create React App with a TypeScript template, confirming the structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The code uses useState to manage characters, loading, and error states, and useEffect to handle data fetching appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  The component uses each character's unique "url" as the key in the list which adheres to React’s best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  The code checks if the characters array is empty and renders a "No characters found." message if no data is present.
