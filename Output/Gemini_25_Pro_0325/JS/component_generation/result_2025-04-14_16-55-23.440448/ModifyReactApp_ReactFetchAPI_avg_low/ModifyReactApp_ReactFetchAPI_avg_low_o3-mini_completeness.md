# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The code includes an <code>input</code> element with a placeholder and an <code>onChange</code> handler (<code>handleSearchChange</code>) that updates the <code>searchQuery</code> state, thereby filtering the characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  The component conditionally renders a "Loading..." message when the <code>loading</code> state is true, effectively indicating that an API request is in progress.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  The <code>useEffect</code> hook is triggered on component mount with the default empty string for <code>searchQuery</code>, which results in calling <code>fetchCharacters('')</code> and therefore initiating a data load.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  Every change in the search input triggers a debounced call to <code>fetchCharacters</code> via the <code>useEffect</code> hook, ensuring that search results are updated dynamically as the user types.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  When no characters are returned (i.e., the <code>characters</code> array is empty) and there is no loading or error state, the component displays a "No characters found matching your search." message.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The accompanying CSS includes media queries (e.g., adjustments for max-width of 600px) that improve the layout and usability on smaller screens, ensuring responsive design.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  The component maps over the <code>characters</code> array to render a list of character names, ensuring that valid API responses are displayed to the user.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  The code uses a try-catch block within the <code>fetchCharacters</code> function to catch and handle errors during the API call, setting an error message in the state and displaying it in the UI. Although it does not employ React’s Error Boundary component, the error handling for asynchronous operations is adequately addressed. The confidence is 90% because a dedicated Error Boundary for rendering errors wasn’t implemented, but it meets the requirements as defined for API error handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The code defines the necessary TypeScript interfaces, such as <code>Character</code> and <code>SwapiPeopleResponse</code>, and the component props are correctly typed, ensuring type safety across the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The solution integrates the search functionality without compromising the original data fetching logic. It still supports initial loading, displays the character list, and handles different UI states (loading, error, no results) while adding the new capability of filtering based on user input.
