- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page editing workflow
  
  The documentation clearly explains the page editing workflow: "User navigates to an existing page's edit view, modifies details, and clicks 'Save'."

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the page duplication feature
  
  The documentation explains the duplication workflow: "User clicks 'Duplicate', potentially modifies the URL (required), and saves, creating a new page instance."

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains the page deletion process
  
  The documentation explains the deletion process: "User clicks 'Delete', then confirms 'Yes' in the prompt" and notes that related data (revisions, extras, tags) are also deleted.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the auto-URL generation from title feature
