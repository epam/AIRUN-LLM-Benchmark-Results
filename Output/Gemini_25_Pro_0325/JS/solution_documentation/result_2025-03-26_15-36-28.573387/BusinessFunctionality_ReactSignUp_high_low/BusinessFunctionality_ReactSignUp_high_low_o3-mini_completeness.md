- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the form submission process and API interaction  
  The documentation describes how the form submission triggers an API call (api.signup) and how it integrates with the backend to create a user account.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the success and error handling during form submission  
  It details that on successful account creation, the system updates the user state via an action, and it explains the error handling mechanism for API submission failures.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains the Redux integration for form state management  
  The explanation covers the use of redux-form for managing form state and how it integrates with Redux for both field-level and form-level state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the visual feedback mechanisms for form validation  
  The documentation explains the use of visual cues (e.g., field highlighting, icons) to indicate error and success states.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the FormGroup component and its role in displaying validation feedback  
  It clearly states that FormGroup is used for rendering individual form fields along with labels and validation messages based on the redux-form field state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains how the form handles submission states (submitting, disabled)  
  It is clearly noted that the form disables the submit button during submission, preventing duplicate submissions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the use of react-document-title for page title management  
  The answer identifies that the page title is dynamically set using DocumentTitle and mentions the getTitle function.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains the Redux Form configuration and field setup  
  The configuration is described, including how redux-form is applied to the component and manages field-level properties.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the business purpose of the signup form for user acquisition
