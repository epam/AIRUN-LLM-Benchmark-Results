# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers all main functionality including adding, editing, deleting, and toggling todos

  The document comprehensively covers all main functionality, specifically mentioning:
  - Task Creation: "Users must be able to add new tasks (todos) to a list"
  - Task Editing: "Users must be able to modify the text of an existing task"
  - Task Deletion: "Users must be able to remove individual tasks from the list"
  - Task Completion/Toggling: "Users must be able to mark individual tasks as completed or incomplete"

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about filtering todos by status (all, active, completed)

  The document clearly describes the filtering functionality: "Users must be able to filter the visible tasks based on their status: All, Active (incomplete), or Completed." It also explains how this is implemented through routing and the UI components.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the user workflow for creating new todo items

  The document explicitly describes the workflow: "**Input Field (`.new-todo`):** Type task text, press Enter to add."

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the editing functionality triggered by double-clicking

  The document specifically mentions: "**Task Label (`label` in `TodoItem`):** Double-click to enter editing mode" and further explains the edit process: "Editing is accessible via a common pattern (double-click)."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the clear completed functionality

  The document clearly describes this functionality: "**Clear Completed Tasks:** Users must be able to remove all completed tasks from the list in one action." It also mentions the UI element: "**Clear Completed Button (`.clear-completed`):** Click to remove all completed tasks. Only visible if there are completed tasks."

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the toggle all functionality

  The document explicitly includes this: "**Bulk Task Completion:** Users must be able to mark all currently visible tasks as completed or incomplete simultaneously." It also describes the UI component: "**Toggle All Checkbox (`.toggle-all`):** Click to mark all tasks complete/incomplete. Visual state reflects if all items are complete."

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the counter for remaining items

  The document mentions: "**Task Count Display:** Users must be shown a count of how many active (incomplete) tasks remain." It also explains how this is implemented in the UI: "Displays the summary information (active count)..."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the persistent storage of todos

  The document thoroughly explains the persistence mechanism: "**Data Persistence:** Task data must persist even if the user closes the browser window or refreshes the page. (Implemented in `TodoModel` using `Utils.store` which wraps `localStorage`)."

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the UI components and their relationships

  The document provides detailed descriptions of all UI components under "Core Components & Relationships," explaining `TodoApp`, `TodoModel`, `TodoItem`, `TodoFooter`, `Utils`, and how they interact with each other.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the business objectives addressed by the application

  The document explicitly addresses business objectives in section 3: "Primary Business Goal: Provide a simple, client-side application for individual users to manage personal tasks or notes effectively." It also covers secondary objectives and how the implementation aligns with these goals.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes performance and scalability considerations

  The document has a dedicated section (5) on "Performance and Scalability Considerations" that discusses optimizations, limitations, and efficiency patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes technical constraints and limitations

  The document thoroughly covers technical constraints in section 4, including client-side only limitations, localStorage limits, routing constraints, and browser compatibility considerations.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the pluralization of item/items text based on count

  The document mentions the pluralization utility: "`Utils` (`utils.ts`): A collection of static utility functions for common tasks like generating UUIDs (`uuid`), **pluralizing words (`pluralize`)**..."
