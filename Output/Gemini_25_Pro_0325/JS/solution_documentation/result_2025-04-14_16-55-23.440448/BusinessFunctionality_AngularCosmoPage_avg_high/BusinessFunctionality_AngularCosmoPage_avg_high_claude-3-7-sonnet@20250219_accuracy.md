- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately describes the REST factory for backend communication
  
  The documentation accurately explains that the REST factory centralizes all backend communication and provides a comprehensive description of its role in handling CRUD operations through Angular's `$resource` service.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation correctly explains the Page factory for storing global page variables
  
  The documentation correctly explains that the Page factory holds the state of the page being edited and serves as a central store for page data that controllers interact with.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately describes the Users factory for storing current user data

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation correctly explains the page controller functionality
  
  The documentation provides a comprehensive explanation of the page controller's functionality, covering its role in managing the page editing interface, handling user interactions, and coordinating with the backend API.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation accurately explains the page creation and editing process
  
  The documentation thoroughly explains the page creation and editing process, including the handling of form inputs, saving changes, and the underlying API calls involved in these operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately describes the local storage recovery mechanism for unsaved changes
  
  The documentation accurately describes the local draft recovery mechanism using localStorage, explaining how it saves drafts locally and prompts users if a newer local version exists compared to the server version.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that the documentation correctly explains the version comparison and management features
  
  While the documentation mentions revision history and that "saving changes to a page automatically creates a historical revision," it doesn't fully explain the version comparison features. It mentions a "Compare" option in the local draft prompt but doesn't elaborate on how versions are compared or managed in detail. The documentation states users can "Compare (seems to load local)" but this indicates uncertainty about the exact implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation accurately describes the page deletion workflow
  
  The documentation accurately describes the page deletion workflow, including the two-step confirmation process to prevent accidental deletion and the comprehensive removal of the page and all its associated data.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately explains the auto-URL generation from title functionality
  
  The documentation correctly explains the auto-URL generation feature, noting that "For new pages, the URL can be automatically generated from the title as the user types, but can be manually overridden."
