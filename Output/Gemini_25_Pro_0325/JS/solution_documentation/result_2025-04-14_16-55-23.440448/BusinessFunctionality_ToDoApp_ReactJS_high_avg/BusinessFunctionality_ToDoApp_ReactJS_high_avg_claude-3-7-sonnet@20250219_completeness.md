# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers all main functionality including adding, editing, deleting, and toggling todos
  
  The document thoroughly covers all the main functionality:
  - Task creation: "Task Creation: Users can add new tasks (todos) to a list."
  - Editing: "Task Editing: Users can modify the text description of an existing task."
  - Deleting: "Task Deletion: Users can remove individual tasks from the list."
  - Toggling: "Task Completion: Users can mark individual tasks as completed or active (toggle state)."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about filtering todos by status (all, active, completed)
  
  The document clearly explains the filtering functionality:
  - "Filtering: Users can filter the displayed tasks based on their status: All, Active, or Completed."
  - It describes the implementation in "app.tsx: componentDidMount (Router)" and "footer.tsx: filter links"
  - The user interaction is detailed: "User clicks one of the filter links ("All", "Active", "Completed") in the footer."

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the user workflow for creating new todo items
  
  The workflow for creating new todos is explicitly detailed under "User Interaction Patterns":
  - "User types the task description into the input field labeled 'What needs to be done?'."
  - "User presses the Enter key."
  - "The input field clears, and the new task appears at the bottom of the list. (app.tsx: handleNewTodoKeyDown)"

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the editing functionality triggered by double-clicking
  
  The document precisely describes the editing functionality triggered by double-clicking:
  - "User double-clicks on the text of an existing task. (todoItem.tsx: label onDoubleClick -> handleEdit)"
  - It also outlines the subsequent workflow including the input field receiving focus, handling Enter or Escape keys, and the blur event.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the clear completed functionality
  
  The clear completed functionality is explicitly covered:
  - "Clear Completed Tasks: Users can remove all tasks marked as completed from the list in a single action."
  - The user interaction is described: "User clicks the 'Clear completed' button in the footer (this button is only visible if at least one task is completed)."
  - Implementation details are mentioned: "footer.tsx: button onClick -> onClearCompleted, app.tsx: clearCompleted"

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the toggle all functionality
  
  The toggle all functionality is well documented:
  - "Bulk Task Completion: Users can mark all currently visible tasks as completed or active simultaneously."
  - User interaction is detailed: "User clicks the down-arrow icon (#toggle-all) at the top-left of the list. If any items are active, all items become completed. If all items are already completed, all items become active."

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the counter for remaining items
  
  The document clearly mentions the task counter:
  - "Task Count Display: The application displays the number of active (incomplete) tasks remaining."
  - Implementation details are included: "app.tsx: render (activeTodoCount), footer.tsx: render"

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the persistent storage of todos
  
  Persistent storage is covered in several places:
  - "Data Persistence: Tasks are saved locally in the browser, so they persist even after the browser window is closed and reopened."
  - Technical details: "todoModel.ts: constructor, todoModel.ts: inform, utils.ts: store using localStorage"
  - Constraints: "localStorage Dependency: Data persistence relies solely on the browser's localStorage."

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the UI components and their relationships
  
  The document provides a comprehensive breakdown of UI components and their relationships:
  - Core components are listed: TodoApp, TodoItem, TodoFooter, TodoModel, Utils
  - Each component's responsibility is detailed
  - The data flow between components is explained
  - The component hierarchy and relationships are described

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the business objectives addressed by the application
  
  Business objectives are explicitly covered in section 3:
  - Primary objective: "To provide users with a simple, intuitive, and persistent single-user interface for managing personal tasks"
  - Secondary objectives are listed in detail
  - Alignment with implementation is explained

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes performance and scalability considerations
  
  Performance and scalability considerations are thoroughly addressed in section 5:
  - Performance optimizations are listed (shouldComponentUpdate, React Virtual DOM, Immutable Updates)
  - Scalability limitations are detailed (Data Volume, State Management, Feature Scalability)
  - Efficiency is assessed for the application's intended purpose

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes technical constraints and limitations
  
  Technical constraints and limitations are well documented in section 4:
  - Technical constraints: Frontend Only, localStorage Dependency, External Router, Browser Compatibility
  - Architectural assumptions: Single User, Component-Based UI, Basic State Management, Immutability Preference

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the document covers the pluralization of item/items text based on count
  
  The document mentions pluralization functionality but doesn't explicitly detail the pluralization of "item/items" text:
  - It references Utils: "Utils (utils.ts): Provides utility functions for generating unique IDs (uuid), pluralizing words (pluralize)..."
  - However, it doesn't specifically describe how this is used to display "item" vs "items" in the footer based on count
  
  This is a minor omission as the feature is referenced, but not fully detailed in the context of the UI.
