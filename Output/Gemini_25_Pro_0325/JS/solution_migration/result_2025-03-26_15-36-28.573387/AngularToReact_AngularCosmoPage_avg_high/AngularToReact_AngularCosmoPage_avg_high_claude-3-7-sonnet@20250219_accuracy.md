# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props
  
  The code consistently uses TypeScript throughout all components with proper type definitions. Type interfaces are defined for all props (e.g., `PageDetailsFormProps`, `ActionToolbarProps`), data models (e.g., `Page`, `User`), and state. Function parameters and return types are properly typed, and TypeScript generics are used where appropriate.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management
  
  Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` is effectively used to manage application state. The code includes implementations of `userSlice` and `pageEditorSlice` with properly defined initial states, reducers, and extra reducers for handling async thunks.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components
  
  All components are implemented as functional components using the React.FC type annotation. For example:
  ```typescript
  const PageEditor: React.FC = () => { ... }
  const PageDetailsForm: React.FC<PageDetailsFormProps> = ({ ... }) => { ... }
  const ActionToolbar: React.FC<ActionToolbarProps> = ({ ... }) => { ... }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately
  
  The code uses React hooks extensively and appropriately:
  - `useState` for component-local state (e.g., `const [tagInput, setTagInput] = useState<string>('')`)
  - `useEffect` for side effects (e.g., data fetching, localStorage interactions)
  - `useCallback` to memoize callback functions (e.g., `handleFieldChange`, `handleSave`)
  - `useMemo` is imported and ready for use where needed
  
  Hooks are also used with proper dependency arrays to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource
  
  API communication is implemented using axios throughout the application. The `apiService.ts` file contains a comprehensive set of functions for interacting with the backend API using axios, replacing the AngularJS $resource approach.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components
  
  All form elements are implemented as controlled components with values tied to state and onChange handlers to update the state:
  ```typescript
  <input
      type='text'
      id="title"
      name="title"
      value={page.title || ''}
      onChange={handleInputChange}
      placeholder="about us, contact us"
  />
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation
  
  React Router is properly implemented with imports from `react-router-dom` and the use of hooks like `useParams`, `useNavigate`, and `useLocation`. The `App.tsx` component sets up routes with `Routes` and `Route` components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization
  
  Internationalization is implemented using `react-i18next` and `i18next`. The code includes proper configuration in `i18n.ts` and uses the `useTranslation` hook in components to access translated strings.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization
  
  The code structure is organized in a way that would support code splitting, with components separated into their own files. However, explicit code splitting using `React.lazy` and `Suspense` isn't clearly implemented in the provided code. The organizational structure is conducive to code splitting, but explicit dynamic imports would strengthen this implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations
  
  `React.memo` is used appropriately for performance optimization on the `PageDetailsForm` component:
  ```typescript
  export default React.memo(PageDetailsForm);
  ```
  This prevents unnecessary re-renders of this component when props haven't changed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks
  
  All useEffect and useCallback hooks include proper dependency arrays. For example:
  ```typescript
  useEffect
