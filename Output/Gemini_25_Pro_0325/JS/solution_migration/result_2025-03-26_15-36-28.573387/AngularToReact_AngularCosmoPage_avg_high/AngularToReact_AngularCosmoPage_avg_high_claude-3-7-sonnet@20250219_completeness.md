# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented

    The code implements all core page management functions:
    - Create: Via `savePage` thunk with a new page (when `page.id` is null)
    - Update: Via `savePage` thunk for existing pages
    - Delete: Via `deletePage` thunk with confirmation dialog
    - Duplicate: Via `savePage` thunk with `duplicate: true` parameter

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present

    Page type selection is fully implemented:
    - The `PageDetailsForm` component has a select dropdown for page types
    - `themePages` are fetched and displayed as options
    - `setPageType` action and `handleTypeChange` handler properly update the state

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists

    URL auto-generation from title is implemented in the `handleFieldChange` function in `PageEditor.tsx`:
    ```typescript
    if (field === 'title' && isNewPage && (!page?.url || page.url === 'new')) {
        const newUrl = String(value)
            .toLowerCase()
            .replace(/ /g, '-')
            .replace(/[^a-z0-9-]/g, ''); // Basic slugify
        dispatch(setPageField({ field: 'url', value: newUrl }));
    }
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented

    Tag management with autocomplete is completely implemented in `PageDetailsForm.tsx`:
    - Input for adding tags with comma, Enter, or Tab key support
    - Tag removal by clicking on tags
    - Tag suggestions fetched from API when typing
    - Suggestion display and selection functionality
    - Handling duplicate tags and empty tags

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available

    All publish status options are implemented:
    - Radio buttons for Published (Y), Draft (N), and Schedule
    - `handleRadioChange` function to update state
    - Conditional rendering of the schedule date input when "Schedule" is selected

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented

    Scheduled publishing date functionality is fully implemented:
    - Date input appears when "Schedule" is selected
    - `handleScheduleDateChange` handler updates the state
    - Logic for handling scheduled dates in the `savePage` thunk, including:
      - Converting between ISO strings and timestamps
      - Setting appropriate publish status based on whether the scheduled date is in the past or future

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present

    Local storage version management is thoroughly implemented:
    - Saving changes to local storage in `handleFieldChange`
    - Detecting newer versions in local storage via `useEffect`
    - `NewerVersionBanner` component for user interaction
    - Functions to use local version (`handleUseLocalVersion`), discard local version (`clearLocalStorageVersion`), and compare versions

- **Pass** (90%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented

    A basic notification system is implemented, but not a full-featured one:
    - Error messages are displayed in the UI
    - Success/failure messages use `alert()` as a placeholder
    - Comments indicate where a proper notification system should be integrated
    
    This implementation is functional but rudimentary. The code notes that a more robust notification system (like react-toastify) should replace the alerts.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present

    Form validation for required fields is properly implemented:
    - URL validation in the `savePage` thunk:
      ```typescript
      if (!currentPage.url || currentPage.url === 'new') {
          return rejectWithValue('page_no_url');
      }
      ```
    - Page type validation:
      ```typescript
      if (!currentPage.type) {
          return rejectWithValue('page_no_type_selected');
      }
      ```
    - Error messages are handled and displayed to the user

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled

    All API endpoints from the original code are implemented in the `
