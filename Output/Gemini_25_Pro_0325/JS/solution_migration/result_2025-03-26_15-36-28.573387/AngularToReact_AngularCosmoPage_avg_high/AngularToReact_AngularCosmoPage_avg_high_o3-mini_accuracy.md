# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props  
  All components, files, and models are defined using TypeScript. Interfaces are provided for data models, and React component props and function parameters are typed. 

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management  
  Redux Toolkit’s createSlice is used in both the user and page editor slices to manage application state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components  
  Every component (e.g., PageEditor, PageDetailsForm, ActionToolbar, NewerVersionBanner) is implemented as a functional component using React.FC.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately  
  The code uses useState, useEffect, and useCallback effectively to handle state and side effects. Additionally, React.memo is applied to optimize render performance.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource  
  API communication is handled using axios calls in apiService.ts, replacing AngularJS’s $resource.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components  
  The form components (e.g., PageDetailsForm) use controlled input elements where the state is managed via React and updated with event handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation  
  React Router is used throughout the application (Routes, Route, useParams, useNavigate) to handle navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization  
  The code integrates i18next with react-i18next, and translations are loaded and used via the useTranslation hook.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization  
  There is no explicit implementation of code splitting (e.g., using React.lazy or dynamic import) in the provided solution. This could be improved for performance optimization.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations  
  React.memo is applied in the PageDetailsForm component to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks  
  The useEffect hooks specify dependency arrays that include all necessary dependencies. There are no obvious omissions affecting functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models  
  All data models (e.g., Page, PageRevision, User, ApiResource, TagSuggestion) are rigorously defined using TypeScript interfaces.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state  
  The code uses custom hooks (useAppSelector) derived from Redux selectors to access state within components.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations  
  Action creators (e.g., setPageField, setPageTags, loadLocalVersion) are defined in the slices and used appropriately to handle state mutations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks  
  Local storage interactions are handled within useEffect and useCallback hooks in the PageEditor component in a clear and structured manner.
