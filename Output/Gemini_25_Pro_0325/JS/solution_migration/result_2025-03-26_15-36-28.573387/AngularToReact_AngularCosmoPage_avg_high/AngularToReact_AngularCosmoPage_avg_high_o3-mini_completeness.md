# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
  The provided migration includes clear implementations for creating content (via createContent and savePage logic for new pages), updating existing pages, deleting pages (deletePage thunk with concurrency for content, revisions, tags, extras), and duplicating pages (via the duplicate flag in the savePage thunk).  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
  In the PageDetailsForm component, a select element is rendered using the available themePages. The reducer in the pageEditorSlice supports setting the page type, ensuring that this functionality exists.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
  In the PageEditor container, when the title field changes on a new page and the URL is still in its default state, a slug is generated from the title and assigned to the URL field.  

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
  The PageDetailsForm component includes an input for tags, handling commas for splitting new tags and fetching autocomplete suggestions using the fetchTagSuggestions API. Tags can be added, removed, and autocomplete suggestions are shown, meeting the requirement.  

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
  The form renders three radio buttons labeled appropriately (“publish” for 'Y', “draft” for 'N', and “schedule” for scheduling) and adjusts the form accordingly when schedule is selected.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
  When the “schedule” option is chosen, the UI displays a datetime-local input, and the savePage thunk properly converts the provided ISO date to a Unix timestamp with logic to publish immediately if the scheduled date is in the past.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
  The PageEditor component includes an effect that checks for differences between the current page state and values in localStorage, displays a banner if a newer local version exists, and provides handlers to load or discard the local changes.  

- **Fail** (90%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
  Although success and error states are handled by calling alert() and logging to the console, a robust notification system (for example, using a dedicated notification library or a Redux-based mechanism) is not fully implemented. This may be acceptable as a placeholder in development, but it does not meet the criteria for a full-featured notification system.  
  Explanation: The usage of simple alerts (and console logs) is a basic solution; however, the requirement explicitly mentions a notification system analogous to the original AngularJS $rootScope.$broadcast('notify', ...), so this implementation falls short of providing a built-in, scalable notification mechanism.  

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
  The savePage thunk checks for missing page type and for an empty or default URL, with the type select element being marked as required. This guards against saving invalid page data.  

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
  The migration provides API service functions for handling content, revisions, extras, revision extras, and tags using axios. All major endpoints from the AngularJS version appear to be covered. The slight deduction is due to some endpoints being commented out or assumed for future expansion, but overall the essential API interactions are handled.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
  The code includes logic for deleting and re-creating content extras (and revision extras) to ensure that additional key/value pairs are maintained during save operations.  

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
  Every time a page is saved, a new revision is created via createContentRevision. This maintains a history of changes and aligns with the original versioning logic.  

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
  The solution separates concerns by organizing code into folders for models, services, store (with slices), features (such as pageEditor with container and presentational components), and reusable UI components.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
  Translation is enabled via react-i18next. The components use the useTranslation hook, and a sample i18n configuration with translation keys (e.g., for buttons, errors, messages) is provided, ensuring internationalization support.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
  The migration preserves similar URL patterns by using routes such as `/new` for new pages and `/edit/:pageUrl` for editing, mirroring the original AngularJS URL structure and parameters.
