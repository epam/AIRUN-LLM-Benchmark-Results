- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component includes all three required form fields: name, email, and password
  
  The code clearly includes the three required form fields:
  ```typescript
  this.signupForm = this.fb.group({
    name: ['', {...}],
    email: ['', {...}],
    password: ['', {...}]
  });
  ```
  
  These fields are also properly implemented in the HTML template with appropriate form controls.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page includes a heading 'Join PodBaby today.'
  
  The heading is present in the HTML template:
  ```html
  <h2>Join PodBaby today.</h2>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a lead paragraph about membership benefits
  
  The lead paragraph is present in the HTML template:
  ```html
  <p class="lead">
    As a member you can subscribe to podcast feeds and keep track of your favorite episodes.
  </p>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form includes a submit button with appropriate styling and icon
  
  The submit button is present in the HTML template with Bootstrap styling and icon:
  ```html
  <button
    type="submit"
    class="btn btn-primary w-100 mt-3"
    [disabled]="(isLoading$ | async) || signupForm.invalid && signupForm.touched">
    <!-- Button content with icon -->
    <i class="bi bi-box-arrow-in-right me-1"></i> Signup
  </button>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a link to the login page with appropriate text
  
  The login link is present in the HTML template:
  ```html
  <p class="mt-3">
    <a routerLink="/login">Already a member? Log in here.</a>
  </p>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the FormGroup component or equivalent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display
  
  A reusable FormGroup component is implemented and used for all form fields:
  ```typescript
  // src/app/shared/form-group/form-group.component.ts
  @Component({
    selector: 'app-form-group',
    templateUrl: './form-group.component.html',
    styleUrls: ['./form-group.component.scss'],
    changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,
  })
  export class FormGroupComponent {
    @Input() control!: AbstractControl | null;
    @Input() fieldId!: string;
    @Input() errorsMap: { [key: string]: string } = {};
    // Implementation for error handling
  }
  ```
  
  And it's used in the template for each form field:
  ```html
  <app-form-group [control]="name" fieldId="name" [errorsMap]="nameErrors">
    <!-- input field -->
  </app-form-group>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Icon component or equivalent is implemented for the signup button
  
  The icon is implemented using Bootstrap Icons in the submit button:
  ```html
  <i class="bi bi-box-arrow-in-right me-1"></i>
  ```
  
  With a comment indicating it could be replaced with a different icon library or component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all validation rules are implemented (name length, email format, password length)
  
  All required validation rules are implemented in the form creation:
  ```typescript
  name: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3), Validators.maxLength(60)], ...],
  email: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.email], ...],
  password: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.minLength(6)]],
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure asynchronous validation for both name and email uniqueness is implemented
  
  Asynchronous validation is implemented for both name and email uniqueness:
  ```typescript
  name: ['', {
    validators: [...],
    asyncValidators: [this.nameTakenValidator()],
    updateOn: 'blur'
