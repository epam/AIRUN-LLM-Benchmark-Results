# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The component imports FormBuilder to create a FormGroup and uses Angular Reactive Forms APIs throughout.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The code includes Validators.required, Validators.minLength (3 for name, 6 for password), Validators.maxLength (60 for name), and Validators.email for the email field.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  The signup component implements two AsyncValidatorFn functions (nameTakenValidator and emailTakenValidator) that invoke the API service methods to check for existing names and emails respectively.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  Each input applies conditional CSS classes ([class.is-invalid] and [class.is-valid]) based on form control status, and the FormGroupComponent displays error messages accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  The onSubmit() function checks for form validity and dispatches the signupStart action, which triggers the authService API call via effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The FormGroupComponent template includes an ngIf block that renders error messages using the invalid-feedback class when validation errors exist.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  The component calls this.titleService.setTitle('Signup - PodBaby') in ngOnInit() to set the page title.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The module configuration includes StoreModule.forFeature and EffectsModule.forFeature with the respective AuthReducer and AuthEffects, and actions are dispatched in the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button is disabled when the isLoading$ observable emits true, ensuring the button is inactive during submission.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  The AuthEffects effect listens for signupStart, maps the response to signupSuccess, and catches errors to dispatch signupFailure.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component implements ngOnInit and ngOnDestroy properly, including unsubscribing from observables using a destroy$ subject.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The AuthService uses Angular's HttpClient to perform post and get requests for API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The error message mappings in the component (nameErrors, emailErrors, passwordErrors) correctly reflect the validation messages expected.
