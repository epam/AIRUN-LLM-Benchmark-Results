# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component includes all three required form fields: name, email, and password  
  The SignupComponent initializes a FormGroup with the controls "name", "email", and "password" and the template contains corresponding input elements.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page includes a heading 'Join PodBaby today.'  
  The template starts with an <code>&lt;h2&gt;Join PodBaby today.&lt;/h2&gt;</code> which satisfies the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a lead paragraph about membership benefits  
  The template includes a paragraph with the class "lead" that describes the membership benefits.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form includes a submit button with appropriate styling and icon  
  The form contains a submit button styled with Bootstrap classes. It uses conditional rendering to show a spinner when loading and includes an <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> element for the icon.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a link to the login page with appropriate text  
  The template includes an anchor tag with <code>routerLink="/login"</code> and the text "Already a member? Log in here."

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the FormGroup component or equivalent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display  
  A FormGroupComponent is provided which handles displaying error messages as well as applying proper CSS classes for valid/invalid states.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Icon component or equivalent is implemented for the signup button  
  Although no separate Icon component is defined, the signup button uses an <code>&lt;i class="bi bi-box-arrow-in-right me-1"&gt;</code> element to render an icon, meeting the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all validation rules are implemented (name length, email format, password length)  
  Validation is set up with Validators requiring:  
  • Name – required, minimum length of 3, maximum length of 60  
  • Email – required and valid email format  
  • Password – required and a minimum length of 6  
  This covers all specified validation rules.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure asynchronous validation for both name and email uniqueness is implemented  
  Async validators (nameTakenValidator and emailTakenValidator) are attached to the "name" and "email" controls, respectively, calling the AuthService methods to verify uniqueness.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API integration is complete with proper error handling  
  The AuthService implements a signup method using HttpClient with error handling via catchError, and the NgRx effects dispatch appropriate actions (signupSuccess or signupFailure) based on the API response.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm the form layout matches the horizontal form structure specified  
  The implementation uses standard Bootstrap spacing classes and a vertical stacking of form groups. There is no evidence of using a horizontal layout (e.g., grid classes or a form-horizontal approach) as some designs might require. If a horizontal layout was explicitly specified, additional structural markup (such as row and column classes) would be needed.  
  (Confidence reduced to 90% because it is possible that the intended design guidelines could accept this layout as “horizontal” given context, but in standard Bootstrap terms it is vertical.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page has proper document title setting functionality  
  The SignupComponent sets the document title using the Title service (with the call to <code>setTitle('Signup - PodBaby')</code>) in ngOnInit.
