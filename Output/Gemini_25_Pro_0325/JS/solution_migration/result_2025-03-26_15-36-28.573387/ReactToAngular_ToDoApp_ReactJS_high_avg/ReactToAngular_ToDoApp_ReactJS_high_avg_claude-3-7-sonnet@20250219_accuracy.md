# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The code clearly uses Angular framework with the appropriate syntax and structure. The NgModule setup and usage of decorators like @Component, @Input, and @Output are consistent with Angular 14.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
  
  The implementation includes proper NgRx store imports, configuration in the AppModule, and store setup with actions, reducers, selectors, and state interfaces.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
  
  The code includes a comprehensive TodoEffects class that handles side effects like loading and persisting todos to localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
  
  The implementation includes a complete set of actions (todo.actions.ts), a properly structured reducer (todo.reducer.ts), and well-organized selectors (todo.selectors.ts).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
  
  All components use the @Component decorator with appropriate metadata. Child components use @Input for property binding and @Output with EventEmitter for event handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators
  
  The TodoItemComponent properly uses @ViewChild to reference the edit input element, replacing React's ref approach.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
  
  All components implement proper data flow with @Input for downward data binding and @Output EventEmitter for upward event communication.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
  
  The implementation includes UtilsService and LocalStorageService with appropriate dependency injection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
  
  Services are properly provided with `providedIn: 'root'` and injected into components and effects through constructors.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
  
  The implementation uses ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush in appropriate components to optimize performance.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
  
  Angular Router is properly configured in app-routing.module.ts with routes for different todo filters.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code organization follows Angular style guide with appropriate naming conventions, file structure, and separation of concerns.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
  
  The implementation includes well-defined interfaces and types (Todo, FilterType, TodoState) that are consistently used.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
  
  All React JSX templates have been properly converted to Angular HTML templates with appropriate Angular-specific directives and binding syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
  
  All React event handlers have been converted to Angular's event binding syntax (e.g., `(click)="onSomething()"` instead of React's `onClick={this.onSomething}`).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs
  
  The implementation is complete with no TODO comments left in the code.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules
  
  The implementation doesn't include any feature modules with lazy loading configured. The entire application is loaded eagerly through the main AppModule.
