# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items

    The implementation includes a TodoListComponent that correctly displays todo items using ngFor with a trackById function for performance optimization. The visibleTodos$ observable in TodoWrapperComponent provides the filtered list of todos to display.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented

    The TodoHeaderComponent handles adding new todos with proper validation for empty strings. The component emits an event that the TodoWrapperComponent catches and dispatches the appropriate NgRx action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works

    The implementation includes toggle functionality in the TodoItemComponent with proper event binding, and the TodoWrapperComponent dispatches the toggleTodo action to update the state in the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented

    The TodoItemComponent implements full editing functionality, including handling Enter and Escape keypresses, focus management, and validation of edited text. The component also handles double-click to enter edit mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented

    The TodoItemComponent includes a delete button that emits an event to remove the todo. The TodoWrapperComponent dispatches the deleteTodo action to update the store accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented

    The TodoListComponent includes the toggle-all input that triggers the toggleAll action. The TodoWrapperComponent dispatches the toggleAllTodos action that marks all todos as complete or incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works

    The implementation includes routing for different filter states (/active, /completed) and the TodoWrapperComponent observes route changes to update the filter state in the store. The selectVisibleTodos selector properly filters the todos based on the current filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items

    The TodoFooterComponent receives the activeCount input and displays it along with the proper pluralization using the UtilsService.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items

    The TodoFooterComponent includes a Clear completed button that emits an event when clicked. The TodoWrapperComponent dispatches the clearCompletedTodos action to remove all completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage

    The implementation includes a LocalStorageService for handling persistence and TodoEffects that load todos on initialization and save todos when they change. The effects use debounce to optimize writes to localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation

    The app-routing.module.ts configures routes with useHash: true to match the original URL structure, with routes for '/', '/active', and '/completed'.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states

    The TodoListComponent uses *ngIf to conditionally show the list section only when todos exist. The TodoFooterComponent also conditionally displays based on the presence of todos.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly

    The implementation properly handles form submissions through keydown events for adding and editing todos. However, there's no explicit form element, which is consistent with the TodoMVC style but could be enhanced with Angular's reactive forms for better validation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships

    The component hierarchy is well-structured with TodoWrapperComponent as the container component and child components for header, list, items, and footer. Communication is handled appropriately through inputs/outputs and the NgRx store.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved

    The implementation preserves all business logic from the original React TodoMVC application, including item management, filtering, persistence, and UI behavior. The code is refactored to follow Angular and NgRx patterns while maintaining the same functionality.
