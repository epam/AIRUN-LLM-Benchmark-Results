# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The migration explicitly mentions Angular 14.x and the implementation uses Angular syntax and modules that are compatible with Angular 14.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The solution includes the StoreModule in AppModule and defines a proper NgRx store with state, actions, reducers, and selectors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  The provided code shows a fully implemented Effects module (TodoEffects) with side-effect handling such as loading and persisting todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  Actions, reducers, selectors, and state files are clearly defined and cover all necessary operations like adding, toggling, deleting, and filtering todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  All components use the @Component decorator along with proper usage of @Input and @Output for property binding and event output.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  The TodoItemComponent correctly uses @ViewChild to access the edit input element instead of employing React refs.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  Components pass data downward and emit actions upward using @Input and @Output, as shown across header, list, and footer components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  The solution includes dedicated services such as UtilsService and LocalStorageService for utility functions and local storage management.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  Angular’s dependency injection is used throughout the code via constructor injection and the use of `providedIn: 'root'` for services.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush is applied in presentational components, optimizing change detection.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  The AppRoutingModule is configured with proper routes and hash-based routing to manage navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code structure, naming conventions, use of modules, and decorators align with Angular style guidelines.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  Strong typing is maintained via TypeScript interfaces (e.g., Todo, FilterType) and the use of type annotations across components and store files.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  All view definitions are converted into Angular HTML templates utilizing Angular directives like *ngIf and *ngFor.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  The solution replaces React’s JSX event handlers with Angular’s event binding syntax (e.g., (click), (keydown)).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  There are no outstanding TODO comments in the final code; notes on refactoring are informational rather than placeholders for incomplete work.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  The solution does not demonstrate lazy loading for feature modules. All components and modules are eagerly loaded within AppModule. Lazy loading is a best practice for larger applications but is not implemented in this migration.
