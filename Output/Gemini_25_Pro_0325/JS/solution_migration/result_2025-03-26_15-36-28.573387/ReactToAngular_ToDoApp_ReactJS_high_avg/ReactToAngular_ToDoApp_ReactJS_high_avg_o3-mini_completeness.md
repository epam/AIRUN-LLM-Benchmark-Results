# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The TodoListComponent uses an *ngFor loop with an async pipe to render every todo from the store, ensuring that every todo item is displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoHeaderComponent captures the new todo input and emits the title. The TodoWrapperComponent dispatches an addTodo action (later modified to include proper UUID generation), which correctly adds new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  There is a toggle checkbox in the TodoItemComponent, which, on change, dispatches the toggleTodo action. The reducer correctly inverts the completed state for the specified todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent supports entering edit mode (triggered by double clicking the label) and provides an input field with keydown handling for both Enter and Escape keys. This ensures that editing and canceling edit operations are handled.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  A delete button exists in the TodoItemComponent (with the CSS class "destroy") that dispatches the deleteTodo action when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  The TodoListComponent includes a "toggle-all" checkbox which, upon change, emits an event handled by the TodoWrapperComponent to dispatch the toggleAllTodos action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  The application uses Angular’s RouterModule to change URL segments. Based on the path (“”, “active”, “completed”), the TodoWrapperComponent dispatches the setFilter action, and the selectors correctly filter the todos accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooterComponent receives the activeCount via Input and displays it appropriately. The component also uses a pluralization utility to adjust the label, confirming correct active item count display.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The TodoFooterComponent provides a "Clear completed" button which, when clicked, emits an event leading to the dispatch of clearCompletedTodos action. The reducer then filters out the completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  The LocalStorageService provides methods to load and save todos. Moreover, an NgRx effect listens to todo-related actions and, with a debounce, writes the current state of todos to localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The AppRoutingModule is configured with routes for "", "active", and "completed" paths, and hash routing is enabled (useHash: true), preserving the URL structure similar to the original TodoMVC.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  The TodoListComponent uses an *ngIf to conditionally render the main section only when there are todo items. Similarly, the TodoFooterComponent displays only when there is a non-zero active or completed count.  
  Explanation: Although the UI for empty states (when there are no todos) is implicit by not rendering the main section or footer, additional explicit messaging (like “No todos available”) is not provided. However, this aligns with the conventional TodoMVC behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  The new todo input in TodoHeaderComponent uses Angular’s ngModel and keydown event handling, submitting the form on the Enter key. The form logic is correctly implemented to trim input before dispatch.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The architecture cleanly separates responsibilities among components (Header, List, Item, Footer, Wrapper), and parent-child communication is handled via @Input/@Output bindings and the NgRx store. The component hierarchy is robust and follows Angular best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  All core functionalities—adding, toggling, editing, deleting, bulk toggling, filtering, and persistence—are present. Additionally, improvements such as the proper separation of UUID generation from the reducer further cement the preservation and enhancement of the original business logic.
