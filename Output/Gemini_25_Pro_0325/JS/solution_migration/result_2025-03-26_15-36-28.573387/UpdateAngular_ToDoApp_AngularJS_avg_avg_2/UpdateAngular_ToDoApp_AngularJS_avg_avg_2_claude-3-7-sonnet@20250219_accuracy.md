# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The code clearly uses Angular 14.x framework, as evidenced by the Angular CLI commands (`ng new angular-todomvc`), the use of modern Angular decorators like `@Component`, `@Injectable`, and the implementation of features that are available in Angular 14.x such as standalone components and improved type checking.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS
  
  The code uses ES modules throughout, with proper import/export statements for components, services, and NgRx entities, replacing the RequireJS module system used in the original AngularJS application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management
  
  The implementation includes proper NgRx store setup with `StoreModule.forRoot({ todos: todoReducer })` in the app module and extensive use of store selectors and dispatchers throughout the components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects
  
  The code includes `@ngrx/effects` with a properly implemented TodoEffects class that handles side effects like loading todos from localStorage, saving todos, and updating the filter based on route changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management
  
  The implementation includes comprehensive actions (add, remove, update, toggle, etc.), a properly structured reducer, memoized selectors, and effects for handling side effects like localStorage persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator
  
  The TodoStorageService is properly decorated with `@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })`, making it available throughout the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service
  
  The TodoStorageService properly implements localStorage persistence with methods for getting and saving todos, wrapped in Observables for async operation compatibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators
  
  All components (AppComponent, TodoWrapperComponent, TodoHeaderComponent, etc.) use the proper `@Component` decorator with templateUrl and other appropriate metadata.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators
  
  The custom directives (TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective) use the proper `@Directive` decorator with appropriate selector metadata.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)
  
  The component templates use proper Angular syntax, including `*ngFor` with trackBy for todo lists, `*ngIf` for conditional display, and proper binding expressions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))
  
  Event binding uses proper Angular syntax throughout the templates, such as `(click)`, `(change)`, `(ngSubmit)`, and custom event bindings like `(addTodo)`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])
  
  Property binding uses proper Angular syntax, including `[ngClass]`, `[checked]`, and binding to custom inputs like `[todo]` and `[isEditing]`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed
  
  The implementation includes proper use of lifecycle hooks like `OnInit` in the TodoWrapperComponent and `OnChanges` in the TodoItemComponent, with proper implementation of the corresponding methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models
  
  The code defines proper TypeScript interfaces for models (Todo and Filter enum) and state (TodoState), providing type safety throughout the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services
  
  Dependency injection is properly implemented throughout the application, with services, store, and other dependencies injected through constructor parameters.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code generally follows Angular style guide conventions with proper naming, file organization, and coding patterns. There are a few minor style
