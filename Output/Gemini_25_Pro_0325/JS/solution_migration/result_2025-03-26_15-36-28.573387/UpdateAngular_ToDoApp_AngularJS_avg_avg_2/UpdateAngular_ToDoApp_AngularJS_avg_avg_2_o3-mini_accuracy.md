# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The answer clearly states "migrate the AngularJS TodoMVC application to Angular 14.x" and all module imports, configuration, and references are consistent with Angular 14.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
  The code uses standard ES module import/export syntax, and no RequireJS module syntax is present.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
  The application sets up NgRx with StoreModule, defines a reducer, and uses @ngrx/store selectors and dispatches actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
  NgRx Effects are fully implemented (e.g., for loading and saving todos), confirming side-effect management.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
  The answer provides detailed definitions for actions, a reducer to manage todo state, a set of selectors, and corresponding effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
  The TodoStorageService is decorated with @Injectable (using providedIn: 'root'), ensuring proper dependency injection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
  The TodoStorageService clearly reads from and writes to localStorage for persisting todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
  All components (e.g., TodoWrapperComponent, TodoHeaderComponent, etc.) are appropriately decorated with @Component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
  Both TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective are implemented using the @Directive decorator.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
  The component templates employ Angular structural directives such as *ngIf and *ngFor appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
  Event bindings (e.g., (click), (blur), (ngSubmit)) are used correctly in the templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
  Property bindings (e.g., [ngClass], [checked]) are correctly implemented in the templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
  Lifecycle hooks like ngOnInit in the TodoWrapperComponent and ngOnChanges in the TodoItemComponent are used correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
  Data models are well defined using a Todo interface and a Filter enum.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
  Dependencies are injected via the constructor in components and services consistently.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code structure, naming, and separation of concerns generally adhere to the Angular style guide.  
  <!-- Explanation: Although most conventions are followed, minor stylistic choices (such as extensive inline comments or optional commented-out code) introduce a slight subjectivity that prevents a full 100% confidence. -->

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
  The provided code appears clean, and error handling is implemented in the service and effects.  
  <!-- Explanation: Since the application has not been run in an actual environment, there is some uncertainty about runtime warnings, but based on the code, it is expected to be free of console errors. -->

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
  The code correctly utilizes TypeScript types, interfaces, and enums throughout.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
  The answer includes multiple commented-out code blocks and optional installation instructions. This does not fully comply with the requirement to remove commented-out code and TODOs.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design  
  Each component, service, and directive has a clear, focused responsibility, adhering well to the single responsibility principle.
