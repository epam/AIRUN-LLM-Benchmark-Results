  A TodoHeaderComponent is present, which includes an input field and an add event.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos  
  The TodoItemComponent supports editing. It switches to an editing mode and handles both save and cancel actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics  
  The TodoFooterComponent shows the count of remaining items (todo count) and displays it appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos  
  The TodoHeaderComponent dispatches an addTodo action when a non-empty title is entered.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos  
  The TodoItemComponent allows editing of a todoâ€™s title and dispatches an updateTodo action based on user interaction.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos  
  The TodoItemComponent includes a button that triggers deletion (deleteTodo event) which the parent component handles.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed  
  A toggle mechanism is present in both TodoItemComponent (individual toggle) and TodoWrapperComponent (toggle all) for marking todos as completed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)  
  Filtering is implemented in the selectors and updated via routing changes (setFilter action), and the footer provides navigation for filtering.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete  
  The code handles toggling all todos using toggleAllTodos in the reducer and a corresponding checkbox in the main section.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos  
  Clear completed functionality is provided by TodoFooterComponent, which dispatches the clearCompletedTodos action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos  
  A selector (selectRemainingCount) is used and its value is shown in the footer, ensuring the remaining count is displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage  
  The TodoStorageService appropriately saves todos to localStorage, as demonstrated by the saveTodos and loadTodos methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization  
  On initialization (ngOnInit in TodoWrapperComponent), the loadTodos action is dispatched, and the associated effect loads todos from localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing  
  The TodoEscapeDirective listens for the escape key and triggers an event that cancels the editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo  
  The TodoFocusDirective sets focus on the input field when a todo enters editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original  
  The migration includes copying the original CSS files (base.css and index.css) into the Angular project and referencing them in angular.json, thus preserving the visual styling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately  
  The code trims input and, in the update scenario, if the title is empty after trimming, it triggers deletion logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter  
  The routing configuration and the updateFilter effect ensure that the URL corresponds to the selected filter ("/", "/active", or "/completed").
