# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all React imports use React 18.x compatible syntax
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all components use functional component syntax with hooks instead of class components
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Redux Toolkit's createSlice is used for state management
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for all props, state, and Redux store
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses immutable state updates in reducers
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that nanoid is used for ID generation instead of custom UUID implementation
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application uses React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that useCallback is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage handling is implemented in a modern way
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows consistent naming conventions throughout the application
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper error handling is implemented where necessary
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware
- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that React.lazy is used for code splitting where appropriate

    The code does not implement any code splitting using React.lazy. In a complete migration to modern React practices, React.lazy would typically be used to split code into loadable chunks for performance optimization, especially for larger applications. There is no implementation of React.lazy or React.Suspense for component loading in the provided code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the codebase has no TODOs remaining
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux Provider wraps the application entry point
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure strict TypeScript type checking is implemented throughout the application
