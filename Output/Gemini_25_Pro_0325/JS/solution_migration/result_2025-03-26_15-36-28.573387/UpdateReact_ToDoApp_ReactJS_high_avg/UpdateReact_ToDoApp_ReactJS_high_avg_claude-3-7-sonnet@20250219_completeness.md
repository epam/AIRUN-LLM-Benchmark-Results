# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed

    The code correctly implements this functionality in the `App.tsx` component through the `handleNewTodoKeyDown` callback function which checks for the Enter key, dispatches the `addTodo` action, and clears the input field.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter

    The `TodoList.tsx` component properly filters todos based on the selected filter (ALL_TODOS, ACTIVE_TODOS, COMPLETED_TODOS) using a `useMemo` hook that returns the filtered list of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos

    The application includes a "toggle all" checkbox in the `TodoList.tsx` component that dispatches the `toggleAll` action when clicked, affecting all todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted

    The `TodoItem.tsx` component implements all required functionality:
    - Toggle: Uses the `handleToggle` callback to dispatch `toggleTodo`
    - Edit: Uses `handleEdit`, `handleSave`, and related functions
    - Delete: Uses the `handleDestroy` callback to dispatch `destroyTodo`

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode

    In `TodoItem.tsx`, the label has an `onDoubleClick={handleEdit}` event handler that calls `dispatch(startEditingTodo(todo.id))` to enter edit mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo

    The `handleKeyDown` function in `TodoItem.tsx` checks for the Enter key and calls `handleSave` when detected, which dispatches the `saveTodo` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value

    The `handleKeyDown` function in `TodoItem.tsx` also checks for the Escape key and calls `handleCancel` which dispatches `cancelEditingTodo` and resets the edit field to the original todo title.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items

    The `Footer.tsx` component calculates `activeTodoCount` using a `useMemo` hook and displays it with appropriate pluralization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)

    The `Footer.tsx` component includes filter links for All, Active, and Completed, with proper URL hash management ("#/", "#/active", "#/completed").

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos

    The `Footer.tsx` component includes a "Clear completed" button that calls `handleClearCompleted` which dispatches the `clearCompleted` action. The button is conditionally rendered only when there are completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence

    The application implements localStorage persistence through:
    - `localStorage.ts` utility functions for loading and saving state
    - Initial state loading in the Redux slice
    - A custom middleware in `store.ts` that saves to localStorage after relevant state changes

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state

    The code correctly implements conditional rendering:
    - The footer and main section are not rendered when there are no todos
    - The "Clear completed" button only appears when there are completed todos
    - The edit input only appears when a todo is in editing mode

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count

    The `Footer.tsx` component includes a `pluralize` function that correctly displays "1 item left" vs "n items left" based on the count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components

    The application is well-structured with focused components:
    - `App.tsx` for overall layout and input handling
    - `TodoList.tsx` for rendering the list and handling toggle-all
    - `TodoItem.tsx` for individual todo operations
    - `Footer.tsx` for filters and counts

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by
