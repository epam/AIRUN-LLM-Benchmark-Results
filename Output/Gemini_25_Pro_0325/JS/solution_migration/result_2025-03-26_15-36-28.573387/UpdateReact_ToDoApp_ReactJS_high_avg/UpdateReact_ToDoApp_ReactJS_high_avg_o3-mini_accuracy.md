# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all React imports use React 18.x compatible syntax  
  The code uses React 18’s createRoot API (in index.tsx), which confirms compatibility with React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all components use functional component syntax with hooks instead of class components  
  All components (App, TodoList, TodoItem, Footer) are implemented as functional components using hooks such as useState, useEffect, useCallback, and useRef.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Redux Toolkit's createSlice is used for state management  
  The todosSlice.ts file uses createSlice from Redux Toolkit to manage the todos state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for all props, state, and Redux store  
  The code defines interfaces in the src/types folder, including Todo, TodosState, FilterStatus, and RootState, ensuring consistent type checking.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses immutable state updates in reducers  
  The slice reducers use createSlice, which leverages Immer to allow “mutable-like” syntax while maintaining immutable state updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that nanoid is used for ID generation instead of custom UUID implementation  
  The todosSlice.ts imports and uses nanoid from 'nanoid' for generating unique IDs.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application uses React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate  
  Components such as TodoItem and Footer are wrapped in React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that useCallback is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders  
  The code consistently uses useCallback for event handlers in components like App and TodoItem.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage handling is implemented in a modern way  
  The localStorage logic is encapsulated in dedicated functions (loadState and saveState) in a separate module with proper error handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code follows consistent naming conventions throughout the application  
  All file names, variables, and functions follow clear and consistent naming conventions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper error handling is implemented where necessary  
  Error handling is present in localStorage functions using try/catch blocks, and there is a condition to log errors if the root container is not found.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware  
  The store configuration includes a custom middleware to save state updates to localStorage after dispatches relevant to todos.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure that React.lazy is used for code splitting where appropriate  
  There is no usage of React.lazy for dynamic import/code splitting in the provided code. While the application is modularized, integrating React.lazy could further optimize the initial load by deferring non-critical parts of the application.  
  (Confidence is 90% because code splitting via React.lazy is an optimization; its absence does not break functionality but falls short of the requirement.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the codebase has no TODOs remaining  
  There are no outstanding TODO comments indicating incomplete functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux Provider wraps the application entry point  
  The index.tsx file correctly wraps the application with the Redux Provider, supplying the configured store.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure strict TypeScript type checking is implemented throughout the application  
  The tsconfig.json specifies strict type checking, and TypeScript interfaces are appropriately used for props, state, and Redux store.
