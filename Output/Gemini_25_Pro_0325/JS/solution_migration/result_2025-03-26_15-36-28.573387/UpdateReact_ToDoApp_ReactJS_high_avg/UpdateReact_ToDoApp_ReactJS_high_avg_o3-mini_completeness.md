# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The App component’s input has an onKeyDown handler that checks for the Enter key (using ENTER_KEY) and dispatches the addTodo action when a non-empty title is entered.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The TodoList component correctly filters the todos based on the current filter (all, active, completed) and maps over the filtered array to render TodoItem components.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  The TodoList component includes a "toggle-all" checkbox that, when changed, dispatches the toggleAll action updating all todo items’ completion status.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  In the TodoItem component, there are handlers for toggling (via checkbox), editing (via double-click and input updates), and deletion (via the destroy button), ensuring full CRUD functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  The TodoItem component listens for a double-click event on the label, which triggers the startEditingTodo action to enable editing mode for that specific todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  Within the TodoItem component’s input field for editing, the onKeyDown event listens for the Enter key and calls the handleSave callback to submit the edited todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  The onKeyDown event in the TodoItem component also listens for the Escape key, calling handleCancel to cancel editing and reset the edit text to the todo’s original title.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  The Footer component calculates the count of active todos and displays it prominently, ensuring that users can see the number of items left.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The Footer includes links that update the hash and, consequently, the filter state. This correctly provides filtering options for all, active, and completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  The Footer component conditionally renders a "Clear completed" button when there are completed todos, allowing users to quickly clear them.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  The localStorage utility functions (loadState and saveState) and the middleware in the Redux store ensure that todo state is persisted in localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  Both the TodoList and Footer components conditionally render (e.g., not rendering Footer if no todos exist, or conditionally showing the clear button) based on the current state of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  A simple pluralization function is used in the Footer component to correctly display “item” vs. “items” based on the active todo count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The code is organized into properly encapsulated components (App, TodoList, TodoItem, Footer) with a clear separation of concerns for each functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The provided file structure organizes code into folders such as app, components, features, and types, which clearly aligns with the modern best practices for maintainability and scalability.
