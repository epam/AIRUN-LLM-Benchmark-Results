# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'
  
  The code includes a `Header.tsx` component that renders a header with the class name "header" and a child h1 element with the class name "header-title" containing the text "Virtual Piano".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons
  
  The `Controls.tsx` component renders a div with class "btn-container" containing two buttons labeled "Notes" and "Letters" with appropriate class names and onClick handlers to toggle between display modes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)
  
  The `Piano.tsx` component properly renders both white keys (natural notes) and sharp keys. The component maps through `whiteKeysData` array to render natural keys, and maps through `sharpKeysData` array to render sharp keys within a container with class "keys-sharp".

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes
  
  In the `PianoKey.tsx` component, each piano key div includes `data-note` and `data-letter` attributes that are correctly set using the props passed to the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked
  
  The application uses the `useAudio` hook to handle audio playback. When a piano key is clicked, the `handleInteractionStart` function in `App.tsx` calls `playSound` with the correct note, which plays the corresponding audio file.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)
  
  The `PianoKey` component applies the "piano-key-active" class when the `isActive` prop is true. This prop is derived from the `activeNotes` set in `App.tsx`, which tracks currently pressed keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes
  
  The application sets up keyboard event listeners in `App.tsx` using `useEffect`. The `handleKeyDown` and `handleKeyUp` functions correctly map keyboard keys to piano notes using the `allKeysData` array and trigger appropriate audio playback.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked
  
  The `Controls` component has buttons that call the `onModeChange` callback with either 'notes' or 'letters', which is handled by `App.tsx` to update the `keyDisplayMode` state. This state is passed to the `Piano` component, which in turn passes it to each `PianoKey`, affecting what text is displayed on the keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes
  
  The `FullscreenButton` component implements fullscreen functionality using the browser's Fullscreen API. It toggles between normal and fullscreen modes when clicked, with appropriate error handling and state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly
  
  The application uses a `Set` for `activeNotes` which inherently supports multiple active keys. The keyboard event handling also accounts for multiple key presses by tracking which notes are played via keyboard in `keyboardPlayedNotes`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys
  
  The implementation tracks mouse state with `isMouseDown` and uses `onMouseEnter` events in combination with this state to detect dragging across keys. The `PianoKey` component implements `onMouseEnter` handlers that check if the mouse is down to start playing the note when dragged over.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information
  
  The `Footer.tsx` component renders a footer with class "footer" containing a div with class "footer-container" displaying the year "2023".
