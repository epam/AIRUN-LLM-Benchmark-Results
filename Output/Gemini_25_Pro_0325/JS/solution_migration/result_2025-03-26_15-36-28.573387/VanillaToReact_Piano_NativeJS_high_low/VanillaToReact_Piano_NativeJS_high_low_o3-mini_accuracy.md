# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration  
  The entry point (index.tsx) uses ReactDOM.createRoot, which is standard in React 18, and the created project employs TypeScript as evidenced by .tsx files and type annotations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure  
  In the useAudio hook, an interface (SoundMap) is defined to map note keys to HTMLAudioElement instances, ensuring type safety.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks  
  All components (Header, Footer, FullscreenButton, Controls, PianoKey, Piano, App) are functional components and make use of hooks like useState, useEffect, useCallback, and useMemo.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)  
  The App component and several others use useState to manage application state (e.g., activeNotes, keyDisplayMode, isMouseDown) along with useEffect to manage side effects, ensuring proper state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels  
  The App component registers global 'keydown' and 'keyup' event listeners using useEffect and useCallback, ensuring that keyboard input is captured appropriately for playing notes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events  
  Mouse events, including onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseLeave, and onMouseEnter, are correctly implemented on the PianoKey component using React’s synthetic event system.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment  
  The useAudio hook uses useMemo and require statements to ensure that audio resources are loaded once and are correctly bundled by Create React App.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility  
  The FullscreenButton component uses state and effect hooks to listen for fullscreen changes and provides asynchronous functions to request and exit fullscreen, handling potential errors properly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns  
  Conditional classes for components (e.g., active/inactive styles in PianoKey and display mode in Piano) are applied using array filters and string joins, which is a standard React practice.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate  
  The PianoKey component is wrapped with React.memo to avoid unnecessary re-renders, and event handlers are optimized with useCallback.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations  
  The audio playback logic resets the audio’s currentTime before playing and uses hooks to ensure Audio objects are maintained in memory only when needed, matching React’s lifecycle management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application  
  Throughout the codebase, strict typing is enforced, including interfaces for props and structures (e.g., KeyData, PianoKeyProps, SoundMap) and explicit use of TypeScript in component definitions.
