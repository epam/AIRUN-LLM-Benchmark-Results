# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'  
  The Header component renders a header element containing an h1 with the text "Virtual Piano".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons  
  The Controls component includes two buttons labeled "Notes" and "Letters" wrapped in a designated button container.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)  
  The Piano component maps over white keys and sharp keys, rendering components for both natural and sharp keys including a placeholder for missing sharp keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes  
  Each PianoKey renders with data attributes "data-note" and "data-letter" that align with the key's properties.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked  
  The useAudio hook properly maps each note to its corresponding audio file while the interaction handlers call playSound with the correct note.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)  
  The App component maintains an activeNotes Set, and PianoKey applies a conditional CSS class (e.g., "piano-key-active") when its note is active.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes  
  Global keydown and keyup event listeners are set up in the App component, mapping pressed keys to notes based on their letters and triggering audio playback.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked  
  The state keyDisplayMode is updated via the Controls component, and PianoKey displays either the note or the letter based on that state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes  
  The FullscreenButton component utilizes the fullscreen API, toggles classes accordingly, and handles errors during mode changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly  
  The use of a Set for activeNotes allows for concurrent note activations, and the event handlers properly add and remove notes without interference.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys  
  The PianoKey component listens for mouse enter, down, and leave events while the App maintains a global isMouseDown state, enabling drag-to-play functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information  
  The Footer component renders a footer element that contains a div indicating the year "2023".
