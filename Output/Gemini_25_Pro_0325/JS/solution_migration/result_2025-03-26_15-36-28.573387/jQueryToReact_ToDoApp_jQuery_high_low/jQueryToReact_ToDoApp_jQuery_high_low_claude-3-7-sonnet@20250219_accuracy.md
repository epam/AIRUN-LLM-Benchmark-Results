# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18.x
  
  The code shows clear use of React 18 features, particularly with the `ReactDOM.createRoot` API in `src/index.tsx` which is specific to React 18:
  ```typescript
  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
    document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement
  );
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript for type safety
  
  TypeScript is consistently used throughout the codebase with proper type annotations including interfaces (`Todo`, `TodosState`), type aliases (`FilterStatus`), component type declarations (`React.FC<TodoItemProps>`), and proper typing of hooks and functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for state management
  
  The implementation correctly uses Redux Toolkit with `createSlice` to define the todos reducer with actions and state. The slice includes properly defined reducers and prepared action creators:
  ```typescript
  const todosSlice = createSlice({
    name: 'todos',
    initialState,
    reducers: {
      // reducers defined here
    }
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm nanoid is used for generating unique IDs
  
  The code properly imports and uses `nanoid` from Redux Toolkit for generating unique IDs in the `addTodo` action:
  ```typescript
  prepare: (title: string) => ({
    payload: {
      id: nanoid(),
      title: title.trim(),
      completed: false,
    },
  }),
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code uses functional components with hooks instead of class components
  
  All components are implemented as functional components with React hooks. Examples include:
  - `useState` for local state management in `TodoItem` and `Header`
  - `useRef` for DOM references in `TodoItem`
  - `useEffect` for side effects like focusing inputs
  - Custom hooks like `useAppDispatch`, `useAppSelector`, and `useRouterFilterSync`

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains the same routing functionality with proper route handling
  
  The application correctly implements routing using `react-router-dom` with `HashRouter` to maintain the original TodoMVC hash-based routing. The `useRouterFilterSync` hook properly syncs the URL filter parameter with the Redux state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Redux store is properly configured with appropriate slices
  
  The Redux store is correctly configured using `configureStore` with the todos reducer:
  ```typescript
  export const store = configureStore({
    reducer: {
      todos: todosReducer,
    },
  });
  ```
  The store also includes proper type exports for `RootState` and `AppDispatch`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the Redux provider is set up in the application entry point
  
  The Redux `Provider` is correctly set up in the application entry point (`src/index.tsx`) to wrap the entire application:
  ```typescript
  root.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
      <Provider store={store}>
        <App />
      </Provider>
    </React.StrictMode>
  );
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for all data structures
  
  The code defines appropriate interfaces and types for all data structures:
  ```typescript
  export interface Todo {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    completed: boolean;
  }
  
  export type FilterStatus = 'all' | 'active' | 'completed';
  
  interface TodosState {
    todos: Todo[];
    filter: FilterStatus;
  }
  ```
  Component props are also properly typed:
  ```typescript
  interface TodoItemProps {
    todo: Todo;
  }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows React best practices for component composition
  
  The application follows React best practices by:
  - Breaking down the UI into focused, reusable components (`Header`, `TodoList`, `TodoItem`, `Footer`, etc.)
  - Using proper component composition with props passing
  - Keeping state as close as needed to the components that
