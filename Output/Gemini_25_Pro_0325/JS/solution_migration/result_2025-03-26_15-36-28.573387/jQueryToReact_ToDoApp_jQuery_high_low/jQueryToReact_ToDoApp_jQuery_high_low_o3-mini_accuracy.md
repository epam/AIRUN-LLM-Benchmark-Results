# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18.x  
  The code uses ReactDOM.createRoot (introduced in React 18) and React.StrictMode as part of the new Create React App template. This confirms React 18 is in use.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript for type safety  
  All files have a .tsx or .ts extension, and explicit type definitions (such as interfaces for Todo and FilterStatus) are provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for state management  
  The Redux state is managed using Redux Toolkitâ€™s createSlice, as seen in the todosSlice.ts file.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm nanoid is used for generating unique IDs  
  The code imports and uses nanoid (in the addTodo reducer) to generate unique IDs for new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code uses functional components with hooks instead of class components  
  All components (e.g., TodoItem, Header, MainSection) are implemented as functional components and employ hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, etc.).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains the same routing functionality with proper route handling  
  The routing is handled with HashRouter, Routes, and Route from react-router-dom, and the useRouterFilterSync hook synchronizes the URL filter with Redux state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Redux store is properly configured with appropriate slices  
  The store is configured in store/index.ts using configureStore, and the todos slice is appropriately integrated.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the Redux provider is set up in the application entry point  
  In src/index.tsx, the <Provider store={store}> wraps the App component, ensuring Redux is properly set up.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for all data structures  
  Interfaces (e.g., Todo, FilterStatus) and types (e.g., RootState, AppDispatch) are correctly defined and used throughout the app.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the code follows React best practices for component composition  
  Components are well-organized, separated by functionality, and use hooks appropriately. The only slight room for improvement is further abstraction or optimization in some areas, hence a 90% confidence level.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles keyboard events properly  
  Keyboard events (Enter for submitting, Escape for canceling edits) are properly handled in the TodoItem component, ensuring correct behavior in creating/updating todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application maintains local storage persistence if implemented  
  The code in localStorage.ts implements both loadState and saveState with proper error handling and hooks into the Redux store subscription.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  Although we cannot execute the code here, the provided implementation follows best practices and includes try/catch blocks for errors in localStorage access. Confidence is at 90% since runtime behavior may reveal warnings that are not evident through static review.

- **Pass** (85%): Verify the application implements proper error handling  
  Error handling is implemented in the localStorage utility with try/catch blocks, and the code logs errors to the console. While adequate for this context, there is room for more robust error reporting in a production-grade app, so confidence is at 85%.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the code is optimized with no unnecessary re-renders  
  The use of selectors (createSelector) from Redux Toolkit and functional components with hooks suggests attention to performance optimization. However, without profiling there may be slight uncertainties, so the confidence level is at 90%.
