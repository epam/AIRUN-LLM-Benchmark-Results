# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos  
  The provided code defines a Header component that renders a title ("todos") and an input field for new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos  
  The MainSection component includes a toggle-all checkbox and renders the TodoList component, which in turn displays the todo items.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button  
  The TodoItem component correctly renders a checkbox for toggling, a label for the todo title, and a button for deletion.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode  
  The TodoItem component listens for a double-click event on the label, switching the component into editing mode as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The implementation uses both Redux state management and React Router (via NavLink and a hook for syncing) to filter the todos by status.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization  
  The Footer component correctly uses the pluralize utility function and displays the count of active items.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter  
  Filter links in the Footer are rendered using NavLink which applies a "selected" class to the active filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist  
  The Footer displays the "Clear completed" button conditionally when there are completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter  
  The Header component listens for the Enter key on the input field, dispatching an action to add a new todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos  
  The TodoItem component uses a checkbox with an onChange handler that dispatches the toggle action for each todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once  
  The MainSection component includes a master toggle-all checkbox that sets the completed state for all todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management  
  The TodoItem component enters an editing mode upon double-click and uses useEffect to correctly focus the edit input.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos  
  A dedicated delete button in the TodoItem component dispatches an action to remove the corresponding todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos  
  The Footer component has a button that dispatches an action to clear completed todos from the list.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status  
  The filtering logic uses Redux selectors and routing (via the useRouterFilterSync hook) to correctly filter todos according to the selected status.
