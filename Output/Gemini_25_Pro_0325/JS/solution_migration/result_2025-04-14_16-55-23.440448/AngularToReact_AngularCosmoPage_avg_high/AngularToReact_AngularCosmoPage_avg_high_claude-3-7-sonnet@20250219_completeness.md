- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present
  
  Local storage features are implemented:
  - Custom `useLocalStorage` hook manages persisting/retrieving data
  - `hasLocalChanges` state detects differences between API and local versions
  - UI shows banner with options to use, discard, or compare versions

  - Auto-dismiss functionality is included for timed notifications

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present
  
  Form validation is implemented:
  - The savePage thunk validates required fields before API calls
  - Appropriate error notifications are shown for missing URL or page type
  - Special validation for duplicate operations ensures different URLs

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled
  
  All required API endpoints are implemented in the apiService:
  - Content CRUD operations (getById, getByUrl, create, update, delete)
  - Content revisions, extras, and tags endpoints
  - User and theme endpoints 
  - All endpoints follow a consistent pattern and are organized by resource type

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented
  
  Extras management is implemented:
  - The ContentData interface includes extras as Record<string, any>
  - The savePage thunk handles saving extras to both content and revision endpoints
  - JSON stringification for object/array extras is maintained from the original code

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained
  
  Revision history functionality is maintained:
  - The apiService includes endpoints for content revisions
  - The savePage thunk creates revisions when saving pages
  - Revision extras are saved alongside content extras

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components
  
  Code organization follows modern React patterns:
  - Feature folders structure (features/pageEditor, features/users, features/notifications)
  - Business logic is separated into slices and API services
  - UI components are separated from data/state management
  - Types are defined in dedicated files

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved
  
  Translation functionality is preserved:
  - react-i18next is properly configured in i18n.ts
  - The useTranslation hook is used consistently in components
  - All UI text uses t() for translation
  - LanguageDetector is included for automatic language detection

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters
