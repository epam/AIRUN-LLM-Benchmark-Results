# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props.  
  All components, state slices, and services have type definitions and interfaces which promote type safety throughout the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management.  
  Redux state is managed with createSlice in multiple slices (user, page, notifications) and combined via the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components.  
  All components (PageEditor, PageForm, TagInput, Notifications, etc.) are implemented as functional components.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately.  
  The code makes good use of useState, useEffect, and useCallback. Although useMemo is not explicitly used, it is not strictly necessary unless there are expensive computations that need memoization.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource.  
  Axios is used throughout the API service implementation, replacing AngularJS’s $resource.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components.  
  The PageForm and TagInput components use controlled inputs, with onChange handlers dispatching Redux actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation.  
  React Router is properly used (BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, useParams, useNavigate) for route management and navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization.  
  The implementation leverages react-i18next with a proper i18n configuration and translation resources.

- **Fail** (90%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization.  
  Although there’s a commented-out Suspense fallback and a mention of lazy loading, there isn’t an explicit implementation of code splitting (e.g., via React.lazy or dynamic imports). This may be acceptable depending on project requirements, but as stated, it does not meet the evaluation step.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations.  
  The code does not employ React.memo or similar techniques for optimizing render performance of components that might benefit from memoization.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks.  
  The dependency arrays in useEffect and useCallback hooks appear to be correctly specified, ensuring proper re-renders and side-effect management.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models.  
  Interfaces are clearly defined for API payloads, slice state, props, and other models.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state.  
  The custom hooks (useAppSelector) and direct usage of state slices ensure selectors are appropriately used.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations.  
  The Redux slices include well-implemented reducers and action creators to handle state mutations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks.  
  A custom hook (useLocalStorage) is implemented and correctly integrated in the PageEditor component to persist state.
