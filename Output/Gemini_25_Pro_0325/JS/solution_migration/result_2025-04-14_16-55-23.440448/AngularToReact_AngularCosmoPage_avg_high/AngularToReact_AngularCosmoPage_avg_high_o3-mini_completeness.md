# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
  The code defines thunks for saving (which handles both creation and update), deleting, and duplicating pages. All necessary management operations are present.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
  A `<select>` element is provided in the PageForm component that lists page types derived from the loaded theme pages.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
  The PageForm component auto-generates the URL from the title when editing a new page and when the auto URL flag is enabled.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
  The TagInput component manages an array of tags, dispatches actions for tag additions, removals, and integrates debounce-based autocomplete suggestions via the fetchTagSuggestions thunk.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
  The code provides radio buttons for selecting publish status with options for 'Y' (publish), 'N' (draft), and 'schedule'.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
  When the 'schedule' option is selected, a datetime-local input is rendered and the savePage thunk processes the scheduled date using date-fns.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
  A custom useLocalStorage hook is implemented along with logic in the PageEditor component to compare Redux state with locally persisted values and prompt restoration.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
  A notificationSlice and a Notifications component are included. The addNotification action is dispatched for error and success events throughout the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
  The savePage thunk includes checks for the presence of the page type and a valid URL (ensuring URL isnâ€™t empty or set to 'new') before proceeding.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
  The apiService object defines endpoints for content, contentRevisions, contentExtras, contentTags, users, themes, and settings, mapping every necessary action from the original AngularJS code.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
  The code processes 'extras' in the savePage thunk by iterating over bonus fields, handling serialization, and making corresponding API calls both for the content and its revisions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
  Revision history is preserved via the contentRevisionsApi, with a revision created immediately after the main content is saved.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
  The project is well divided into folders such as features (pageEditor, users, notifications), services, shared (hooks), and app, which successfully separates business logic (Redux slices, thunks, API calls) from presentation (React components).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
  The translation functionality is maintained through react-i18next configuration in i18n.ts, and components use the useTranslation hook along with well-defined translation keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
  The routing setup in App.tsx uses react-router-dom to define `/new` for new pages and `/:pageUrl` for editing existing pages, preserving the URL structure from the original application.
