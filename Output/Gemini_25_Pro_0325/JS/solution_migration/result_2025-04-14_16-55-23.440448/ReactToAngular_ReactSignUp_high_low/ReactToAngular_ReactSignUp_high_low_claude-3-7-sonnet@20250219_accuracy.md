# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling
  
  The code properly implements Angular's Reactive Forms. The `FormBuilder` is injected in the constructor, and the form is created with `this.fb.group()` in the `ngOnInit` method. The code also imports `ReactiveFormsModule` in the module definition.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)
  
  The form correctly implements synchronous validators:
  - Name field: `Validators.required`, `Validators.minLength(3)`, `Validators.maxLength(60)`
  - Email field: `Validators.required`, `Validators.email`
  - Password field: `Validators.required`, `Validators.minLength(6)`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use
  
  Async validators are correctly implemented using `CustomAsyncValidators.createNameTakenValidator` and `CustomAsyncValidators.createEmailTakenValidator`. These call the API service methods `isName` and `isEmail` to check if the name and email are already taken.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched
  
  Form fields use `ngClass` to conditionally add `is-invalid` and `is-valid` classes based on control state. The `FormGroupComponent` also displays validation error messages when a control is invalid and touched/dirty.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions
  
  The submission process correctly dispatches the `SignupActions.signupStart` action with the form values when the form is valid. The NgRx effects then handle the API call and dispatch success/failure actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails
  
  The `FormGroupComponent` displays validation errors via an `*ngFor` loop that iterates through `errorMessages`. The component has comprehensive error mapping for standard and custom validation errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service
  
  The page title is set in the `ngOnInit` method using Angular's `Title` service: `this.titleService.setTitle(getTitle('Signup'))`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management
  
  The component correctly uses NgRx for state management, with defined actions, reducers, effects, and selectors. The component injects the Store and subscribes to state selectors.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress
  
  The submit button includes a `[disabled]` attribute bound to `signupForm.invalid || (isSubmitting$ | async)`, which disables the button when the form is invalid or submission is in progress.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses
  
  The `SignupEffects` class properly handles API responses by mapping success to `SignupActions.signupSuccess` and catching errors to dispatch `SignupActions.signupFailure`. The component subscribes to both success and error states.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management
  
  The component follows best practices with:
  - Clean separation of concerns
  - Proper lifecycle hooks (`ngOnInit`, `ngOnDestroy`)
  - Proper unsubscribing via `takeUntil` pattern
  - Use of `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` for better performance
  - Clear method and property naming

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises
  
  The `ApiService` properly uses Angular's `HttpClient` for all API calls, returning Observables rather than direct promises. The service uses RxJS operators like `map` to transform responses.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements
  
  The form validation error messages are properly mapped in the `FormGroupComponent`, including required field, email format, minimum/maximum length, and custom messages for name/email taken validation.
