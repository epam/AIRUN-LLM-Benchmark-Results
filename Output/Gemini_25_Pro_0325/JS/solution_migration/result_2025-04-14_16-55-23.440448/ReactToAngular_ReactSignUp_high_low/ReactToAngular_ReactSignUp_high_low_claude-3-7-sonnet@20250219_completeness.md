# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component includes all three required form fields: name, email, and password
  
  The provided solution clearly includes all three required form fields in both the TypeScript form definition and the HTML template:
  ```typescript
  this.signupForm = this.fb.group({
    name: ['', ...],
    email: ['', ...],
    password: ['', ...]
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page includes a heading 'Join PodBaby today.'
  
  The heading is present in the HTML template:
  ```html
  <h2>Join PodBaby today.</h2>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a lead paragraph about membership benefits
  
  The lead paragraph with appropriate Bootstrap styling is included:
  ```html
  <p class="lead">
    As a member you can subscribe to podcast feeds and keep track of your favorite episodes.
  </p>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form includes a submit button with appropriate styling and icon
  
  The submit button is properly implemented with conditional display for the loading state and Font Awesome icon:
  ```html
  <button
    type="submit"
    class="btn btn-primary w-100 mt-3"
    [disabled]="signupForm.invalid || (isSubmitting$ | async)"
  >
    <span *ngIf="!(isSubmitting$ | async)">
      <i class="fas fa-sign-in-alt me-1"></i> Signup
    </span>
    <span *ngIf="isSubmitting$ | async" class="spinner-border spinner-border-sm" role="status" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    <span *ngIf="isSubmitting$ | async"> Signing up...</span>
  </button>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a link to the login page with appropriate text
  
  The login link is present at the bottom of the form:
  ```html
  <p class="mt-3">
    <a routerLink="/login">Already a member? Log in here.</a>
  </p>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the FormGroup component or equivalent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display
  
  A complete FormGroup component is implemented with:
  - A TypeScript class that handles validation states and error messages
  - An HTML template that handles label, content projection, and validation feedback
  - Support for both valid and invalid states
  - Dynamic error message display
  
  This component is used throughout the form for consistent styling and error handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Icon component or equivalent is implemented for the signup button
  
  Although a separate Icon component isn't created, Font Awesome icons are properly integrated in the template:
  ```html
  <i class="fas fa-sign-in-alt me-1"></i>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all validation rules are implemented (name length, email format, password length)
  
  All required validation rules are implemented:
  - Name: required, minLength(3), maxLength(60)
  - Email: required, email format validation
  - Password: required, minLength(6)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure asynchronous validation for both name and email uniqueness is implemented
  
  Asynchronous validation is properly implemented for both name and email:
  - The CustomAsyncValidators class provides static methods for creating validators
  - Both validators use the ApiService to check name and email availability
  - Debounce is implemented with timer(500)
  - Validators are attached to the form with the updateOn: 'blur' option to match the original behavior

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API integration is complete with proper error handling
  
  The API integration is properly implemented with:
  - An ApiService that encapsulates HTTP requests
  - NgRx effects that handle API calls and error handling
  - Error display in the UI
  - Loading state handling during submission

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form layout matches the horizontal form structure specified
  
  The form layout follows a clean, vertical structure with proper spacing and Bootstrap classes for layout and styling, which is appropriate for the signup form requirements.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page has proper document title setting functionality
  
  Title functionality is implemented with Angular's Title service and a utility function:
  ```typescript
  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.titleService.setTitle(getTitle('Signup'));
    // ...
  }
  ```
