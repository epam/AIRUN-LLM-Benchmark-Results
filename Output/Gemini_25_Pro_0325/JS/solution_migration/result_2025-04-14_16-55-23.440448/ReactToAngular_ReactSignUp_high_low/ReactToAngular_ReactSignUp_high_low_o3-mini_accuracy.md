# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The component imports ReactiveFormsModule and uses FormBuilder to construct the form, which confirms the use of Angular's Reactive Forms.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The signup form defines validators on the "name" (required, minLength(3), maxLength(60)), "email" (required, email), and "password" (required, minLength(6)) fields, meeting the requirements.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  Custom asynchronous validators are implemented for the "name" and "email" fields using API calls (with debounce via timer, switchMap, and error handling), ensuring the checks for taken name and email.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The template applies conditional styling using ngClass for invalid and valid states based on whether the form controls are touched or dirty, and the FormGroupComponent displays errors appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  The onSubmit() method dispatches a signupStart action when the form is valid, which is then handled by an NgRx effect that calls the ApiService.signup method.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The FormGroupComponent template renders error messages within an "invalid-feedback" container when a control is invalid, and a general submission error is also displayed above the form.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  In ngOnInit, the Title service is used with getTitle('Signup') to set the document title, confirming the expected behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The code integrates NgRx with actions, reducers, selectors, and effects, and uses the Store to select and dispatch actions in the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button in the template uses a binding to [disabled] based on the form's validity and an observable representing the submission state, ensuring it is disabled during submission.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  The SignupEffects handle the API call with proper mapping to signupSuccess on success and catchError to dispatch signupFailure with an error message on failure.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component implements OnInit and OnDestroy correctly, uses ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush for performance, and unsubscribes from subscriptions via takeUntil, aligning with Angular best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The ApiService uses Angular's HttpClient to make API requests, and RxJS operators are applied to manage the responses.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The FormGroupComponent consistently maps standard validation errors (e.g., required, email, minlength, maxlength) as well as custom errors (nameTaken, emailTaken) to user-friendly messages, matching the specified requirements.
