# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component includes all three required form fields: name, email, and password  
  All three fields are present in the Reactive Form definition and accessed via getters.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page includes a heading "Join PodBaby today."  
  The template begins with an <code>&lt;h2&gt;Join PodBaby today.&lt;/h2&gt;</code> heading.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a lead paragraph about membership benefits  
  A <code>&lt;p class="lead"&gt;</code> paragraph describes the membership benefits.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form includes a submit button with appropriate styling and icon  
  The button is styled with Bootstrap classes and contains an icon element (<code>&lt;i class="fas fa-sign-in-alt me-1"&gt;</code>) along with a spinner for the loading state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a link to the login page with appropriate text  
  The template contains a link using <code>&lt;a routerLink="/login"&gt;</code> with the text "Already a member? Log in here."

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the FormGroup component or equivalent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display  
  The custom <code>FormGroupComponent</code> is implemented and handles label display, error messages, and pending state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Icon component or equivalent is implemented for the signup button  
  Although no dedicated Icon component is defined, usage of Font Awesome icons (<code>&lt;i class="fas fa-sign-in-alt"&gt;</code>) serves the same purpose.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all validation rules are implemented (name length, email format, password length)  
  The Reactive Form applies Validators (required, minlength, maxlength, email) correctly on the respective fields.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure asynchronous validation for both name and email uniqueness is implemented  
  Custom asynchronous validators are provided through <code>CustomAsyncValidators</code>, which call the API service to check for name/email uniqueness.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API integration is complete with proper error handling  
  The <code>ApiService</code> is used in NgRx Effects for the signup process, and proper error handling is performed with <code>catchError</code> in the observable pipeline.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm the form layout matches the horizontal form structure specified  
  The implementation uses the standard (vertical) form layout with <code>&lt;app-form-group&gt;</code> without explicit Bootstrap grid classes or a horizontal layout container. This might not match the “horizontal form structure” if that was a strict requirement.  
  (Confidence is 90% because while the layout is clear and functional, it does not explicitly use a horizontal layout structure.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page has proper document title setting functionality  
  The <code>SignupComponent</code> uses Angular’s <code>Title</code> service in <code>ngOnInit</code> by calling <code>setTitle(getTitle('Signup'))</code>.
