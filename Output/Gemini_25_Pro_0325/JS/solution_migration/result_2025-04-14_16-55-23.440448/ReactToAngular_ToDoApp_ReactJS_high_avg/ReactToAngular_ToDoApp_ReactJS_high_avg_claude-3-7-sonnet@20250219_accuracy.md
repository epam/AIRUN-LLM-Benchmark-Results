# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The code clearly uses Angular framework features like `@Component`, `@NgModule`, etc., and the configuration explicitly mentions Angular 14+ in comments.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
  
  NgRx store is properly implemented with imports from `@ngrx/store` in multiple files, and the setup is done correctly in the app module and feature module.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
  
  The code includes `@ngrx/effects` implementation with `TodoEffects` class that properly handles side effects like loading and saving todos to local storage.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
  
  The code contains well-structured actions (`todo.actions.ts`), reducers (`todo.reducer.ts`), and selectors (`todo.selectors.ts`) that correctly manage the todo state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
  
  All components use the `@Component` decorator correctly, and the presentational components properly use `@Input` and `@Output` decorators for component interaction.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators
  
  React refs are properly replaced with Angular's `@ViewChild` in the `TodoItemComponent` for accessing the edit input element.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
  
  The code shows consistent use of `@Input()` for data flow from parent to child and `@Output() EventEmitter` for events flowing from child to parent components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
  
  `TodoStorageService` and `UtilsService` are properly implemented to handle data storage and utility functions respectively.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
  
  Dependency injection is correctly used throughout the application, with services provided at the appropriate levels and injected via constructor parameters.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
  
  `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` is correctly applied to presentational components for better performance.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
  
  Angular Router is properly implemented with `RouterModule` in the app routing module and feature routing module, with routes for different todo filters.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code follows Angular style conventions with proper naming, file organization, and separation of concerns.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
  
  TypeScript interfaces like `Todo`, `FilterType`, and `TodoState` are defined and used consistently throughout the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
  
  JSX has been properly converted to Angular's template syntax in the HTML files with correct binding syntax like `[property]`, `(event)`, and `*ngIf`/`*ngFor`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
  
  React event handlers have been replaced with Angular's event binding syntax like `(click)`, `(change)`, etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs
  
  There are no TODOs or unimplemented features in the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules
  
  Lazy loading is properly implemented in the app routing module using the dynamic import syntax to load the TodoFeatureModule.
