# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items
  
  The implementation includes a TodoListComponent that correctly renders the list of todo items. The todos are fetched from the store via the `todos$` Observable in the TodoWrapperComponent and passed to the TodoListComponent via the `[todos]` input property. The list is displayed in the `todo-list.component.html` file within a `<ul class="todo-list">` element.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented
  
  The application properly implements adding new todo items through the TodoHeaderComponent. The component emits an `addTodo` event with the new todo title, which is caught by the TodoWrapperComponent's `onAddTodo` method, dispatching the appropriate `addTodo` action to the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works
  
  Toggling todo items is implemented in the TodoItemComponent with a checkbox that emits a `toggle` event when changed. This is propagated up to the TodoWrapperComponent which dispatches a `toggleTodo` action with the correct todo ID to update the state in the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented
  
  Editing functionality is implemented with double-click to enter edit mode, blur to save, and Enter/Escape key handling. The TodoItemComponent emits appropriate events (edit, save, cancel) that the TodoWrapperComponent uses to dispatch corresponding actions to the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented
  
  Each todo item has a destroy button that emits a `destroy` event when clicked. The TodoWrapperComponent handles this by dispatching a `destroyTodo` action with the todo ID to the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented
  
  The TodoListComponent includes a toggle-all checkbox that emits a `toggleAll` event with the checked state. The TodoWrapperComponent handles this by dispatching the `toggleAllTodos` action to the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works
  
  Filtering is implemented through Angular routing with paths for '/', '/active', and '/completed'. The TodoWrapperComponent subscribes to router events and dispatches the appropriate `setFilter` action. The filtered todos are provided by the `selectFilteredTodos` selector.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The TodoFooterComponent receives the `activeCount` as an input from the TodoWrapperComponent, which gets it from the `selectActiveTodoCount` selector. The count is displayed in the footer with appropriate pluralization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items
  
  The TodoFooterComponent includes a "Clear completed" button that emits a `clearCompleted` event when clicked. The TodoWrapperComponent handles this by dispatching the `clearCompletedTodos` action to the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage
  
  The TodoStorageService handles loading from and saving to local storage. The TodoEffects includes an effect that saves todos to local storage whenever the todo state changes by listening for relevant actions and using the `withLatestFrom` operator to get the current todos state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation
  
  The application uses Angular's router with hash navigation (`useHash: true` in the AppRoutingModule) to maintain the same URL structure as the original. The routes ('/', '/active', '/completed') match the original application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states
  
  The application handles empty states by conditionally rendering UI elements. For example, the TodoListComponent is only shown when there are todos, and the footer is only displayed when there are todos or completed todos to clear.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly
  
  Form submissions are handled appropriately. Adding a new todo handles Enter key, blur events, and empty input validation. Editing todos handles Enter for submission, Escape for cancellation, and blur for saving.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships
  
  The application follows Angular's recommended component architecture with a clear separation of container and presentational components. The TodoWrapperComponent acts as a container that connects to the store and passes data and callbacks to child presentational components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved
  
  All business logic from the original React application has been accurately migrated to Angular with NgRx. This includes todo creation, editing, deletion, filtering, toggling status, marking all as complete, and clearing completed todos, as well as local storage persistence.
