# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The provided migration clearly indicates Angular 14+ (e.g., usage of Angular CLI, Angular-specific decorators, and module structure).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The code includes imports from @ngrx/store, sets up StoreModule.forFeature in the feature module, and uses selectors with proper NgRx patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  The implementation includes an effects file (todo.effects.ts) that handles asynchronous operations (e.g., loading and saving todos) and registers the effects via EffectsModule.forFeature.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  The answer contains well-defined actions, a reducer method using createReducer, and multiple selectors that manage state queries appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  All components use the @Component decorator, and properties are correctly annotated with @Input() and @Output() as needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  The ref usage in React has been successfully replaced by Angular’s @ViewChild decorator (e.g., in the TodoItemComponent for the edit input).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  The components communicate via inputs and outputs, as demonstrated by the use of EventEmitter and property bindings.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  The migration includes Angular services (UtilsService and TodoStorageService) that handle utilities and data persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  Services and the Store are correctly injected into components and other services via constructor parameters.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  Several components use ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush, optimizing performance for presentational components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  The routing is implemented using Angular Router with proper route definitions and lazy loading for the feature module.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The overall project structure, naming conventions, modules, and file organization adhere to Angular best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  The application uses TypeScript interfaces (e.g., Todo, FilterType) and maintains strong typing across actions, reducers, and components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  The conversion from React’s JSX to Angular HTML templates is successfully completed with separate template files for each component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  Event handling is carried out using Angular’s (event) syntax, replacing React’s onEvent handlers appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  The code is free of TODO comments and follows a clean, production-ready state with notes only where necessary.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  The TodoFeatureModule is lazy loaded in the app routing configuration using loadChildren.
