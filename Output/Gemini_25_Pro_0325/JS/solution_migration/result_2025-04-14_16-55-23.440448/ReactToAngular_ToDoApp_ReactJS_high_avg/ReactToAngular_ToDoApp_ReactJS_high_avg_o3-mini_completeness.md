# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The application uses the TodoListComponent to render a list of todos via the async observable from the store. The use of *ngFor with a trackBy function ensures that all todo items are displayed correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoHeaderComponent captures user input and emits an event to add new todos. The container component (TodoWrapperComponent) then dispatches the addTodo action. This confirms that adding functionality is implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  Both individual toggling in TodoItemComponent and bulk toggling via TodoListComponent (the "Mark all as complete" checkbox) are implemented. The reducer appropriately updates the completed status.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent handles initiating an edit on double-click, listens for key events (Enter and Escape), and emits corresponding events. These events are then processed to update the todo title, confirming edit functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  A delete (destroy) action is integrated into the TodoItemComponent with a button click, and the container dispatches the destroyTodo action to remove todo items.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  The TodoListComponent includes a checkbox for toggling all todos. Its corresponding event (toggleAll) is handled in the container to dispatch the toggleAllTodos action, ensuring all items can be marked complete.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  The TodoWrapperComponent reacts to route changes to dispatch a setFilter action. The selectors (selectFilteredTodos) then apply the appropriate filter (all, active, completed) on the todos. This ensures filtering functionality is in place.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooterComponent uses the activeCount observable to display the current number of active (non-completed) todo items, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The TodoFooterComponent provides a clear completed button that emits an event when clicked. The container handles this event by dispatching the clearCompletedTodos action, removing completed todos from the list.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  The TodoStorageService implements loadTodos and saveTodos methods. An NgRx effect listens for changes (including add, toggle, and clear actions) and uses the storage service to persist the updated todo list to local storage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The AppRoutingModule is configured with hash routing (useHash: true). Additionally, the container observes route changes and adjusts the current filter accordingly. This confirms that navigation via URL works as expected.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  When no todos are present, the TodoListComponent's template conditionally omits the main todo list section and the TodoFooterComponent based on the state. While there is no explicit “empty state” message, the structure conforms to the typical TodoMVC pattern. Confidence is 90% because an explicit empty state message is not provided, though it is not strictly required.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  User interactions in input fields (e.g., keydown events and blur events) trigger the correct event emissions; form submissions (via Enter key or losing focus) are handled in TodoHeaderComponent and TodoItemComponent, ensuring the expected behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The code follows a clear container/presentational component pattern. The container (TodoWrapperComponent) interacts with the store and passes data and event handlers to the child components (TodoHeader, TodoList, TodoItem, TodoFooter), ensuring proper hierarchy and communication.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  The migration covers all core functionalities (adding, editing, deleting, toggling, filtering, and persisting todos) as in the original React TodoMVC application. All business rules and state management logic are maintained using NgRx, preserving the original application’s intent.
