# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The migration code clearly uses Angular 14+ as specified in the migration task. This is evident from:
  - Using Angular CLI commands like `ng new angular-todomvc`
  - Using modern Angular decorators (@Component, @Injectable, etc.)
  - Implementing Angular 14+ specific routing configuration
  - Using standalone directives and components with proper Angular structure

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS
  
  The code exclusively uses ES modules with proper import/export syntax throughout all files, for example:
  ```typescript
  import { Component } from '@angular/core';
  import { Store } from '@ngrx/store';
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management
  
  The code properly implements NgRx store:
  - Installs NgRx dependencies: `npm install @ngrx/store @ngrx/effects @ngrx/store-devtools --save`
  - Configures store in AppModule: `StoreModule.forRoot({ [fromTodo.todoFeatureKey]: fromTodo.reducer }, {})`
  - Uses store in components: `this.store.dispatch(TodoActions.addTodo({ title }))`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects
  
  NgRx effects are implemented correctly:
  - Effects module imported in AppModule: `EffectsModule.forRoot([TodoEffects])`
  - TodoEffects class defined with proper @Injectable decorator
  - Effects defined for loading todos and saving todos with proper side effect handling

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management
  
  The implementation includes comprehensive NgRx structure:
  - Actions defined for all todo operations (add, remove, toggle, etc.)
  - Reducer with proper state management logic
  - Selectors for various state queries (filtered todos, counts, etc.)
  - Effects for side effects with localStorage

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator
  
  The code shows proper use of @Injectable decorator:
  ```typescript
  @Injectable({
    providedIn: 'root', // Provide globally
  })
  export class TodoStorageService {
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service
  
  The TodoStorageService correctly implements localStorage persistence:
  ```typescript
  getTodos(): Observable<Todo[]> {
    const todos = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(this.STORAGE_ID) || '[]');
    return of(todos).pipe(delay(100));
  }
  
  saveTodos(todos: Todo[]): Observable<boolean> {
    localStorage.setItem(this.STORAGE_ID, JSON.stringify(todos));
    return of(true).pipe(delay(50));
  }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators
  
  All components are properly decorated with @Component, for example:
  ```typescript
  @Component({
    selector: 'app-todo-header',
    template: `...`,
    styles: [],
  })
  export class TodoHeaderComponent {
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators
  
  The TodoFocusDirective is correctly implemented with @Directive decorator:
  ```typescript
  @Directive({
    selector: '[appTodoFocus]',
  })
  export class TodoFocusDirective implements OnChanges {
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)
  
  The component templates correctly use Angular template syntax:
  ```html
  <section class="main" *ngIf="(todos$ | async)?.length">
  <!-- ... -->
  <ul class="todo-list">
    <app-todo-item
      *ngFor="let todo of filteredTodos$ | async; trackBy: trackById"
      [todo]="todo"
    ></app-todo-item>
  </ul>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))
  
  Event binding is correctly implemented using Angular syntax:
  ```html
  <button class="destroy" (click)="remove()"></button>
  <!-- And -->
  <input
    (blur)="submitEdit()"
    (keyup.enter)="submitEdit()"
    (keyup.escape)="cancelEdit()"
  />
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])
  
  Property binding is correctly implemented:
  ```html
  <li [ngClass]="{ completed: todo.completed, editing: editing }">
  <!-- And -->
  <input
    class="toggle"
    type="checkbox"
    [checked]="todo.completed"
    (change)="toggleCompletion()"
  />
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed
  
  Lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed:
  ```typescript
  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.currentTitle = this.todo.title; // Initialize edit title
  }
  
  // And
  ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges): void {
    if (changes['shouldFocus'] && this.shouldFocus) {
      setTimeout(() => {
        this.el.nativeElement.focus();
      }, 0);
    }
  }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models
  
  TypeScript interfaces are properly defined for data models:
  ```typescript
  export interface Todo {
    id: string; // Use a unique ID instead of relying on array index
    title: string;
    completed: boolean;
  }
  
  export type FilterType = 'all' | 'active' | 'completed';
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services
  
  Dependency injection is correctly implemented throughout the application:
  ```typescript
  constructor(private store: Store) {}
  
  // And
  constructor(
    private actions$: Actions,
    private todoStorageService: TodoStorageService,
    private store: Store
  ) {}
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code follows Angular style guide conventions:
  - Component selectors use prefix 'app-'
  - Consistent naming conventions for files and classes
  - Proper organization of imports
  - Feature-based structure for components
  - Proper TypeScript types

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings
  
  The code doesn't contain any obvious errors or anti-patterns that would cause console errors or warnings. All syntax is valid, and all required dependencies are properly imported.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)
  
  TypeScript features are used appropriately throughout:
  - Type annotations for variables, parameters, and return types
  - Interfaces for data models
  - Type safety in selectors and reducers
  - Proper type assertions where needed

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code
  
  The code does not contain TODOs or commented-out code, except for some explanatory comments about alternative implementation options that serve as documentation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design
  
  The application follows the single responsibility principle:
  - Each component has a specific role (header, list, item, footer)
  - State management is separated into NgRx patterns
  - Services handle data persistence
  - Directives focus on DOM manipulation
