# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The answer explicitly states "migrate the AngularJS TodoMVC application to Angular 14+" and all generated code (Angular CLI project, modules, etc.) is consistent with Angular 14+ conventions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
  All modules are imported using ES module syntax (e.g., import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'), which confirms the use of ES modules.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
  The code integrates @ngrx/store by configuring the StoreModule and defining actions, reducers, and selectors in separate files.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
  The effects are implemented in the TodoEffects class and registered with EffectsModule.forRoot, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
  The answer includes detailed implementations for actions (e.g., addTodo, removeTodo), a reducer handling various state transitions, selectors for querying the state, and effects to handle side effects like persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
  The TodoStorageService is decorated with @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }), which follows Angular’s dependency injection pattern.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
  The TodoStorageService uses localStorage to get and save todos, simulating asynchronous behavior with Observables.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
  Each component (e.g., AppComponent, TodoHeaderComponent, TodoListComponent, TodoItemComponent, TodoFooterComponent) is correctly decorated with @Component and includes the corresponding metadata.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
  The TodoFocusDirective is implemented with the @Directive decorator and correctly manages focus behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
  Templates throughout the components utilize *ngIf for conditional rendering and *ngFor to iterate over collections.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
  Events are bound using appropriate Angular event binding syntax such as (click), (keyup.enter), and (keyup.escape).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
  The code consistently uses property binding, for example, [checked] for checkboxes and [ngClass] for applying CSS classes dynamically.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
  Lifecycle hooks like ngOnInit are implemented in components (e.g., AppComponent and TodoItemComponent) to handle initialization logic properly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
  The Todo data model and FilterType are defined as TypeScript interfaces and types, ensuring type safety throughout the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
  Constructors in components and services correctly inject required dependencies (e.g., Store, Router), adhering to Angular’s DI framework.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The structure of the code (separated modules, components, services, and directives) and its naming conventions align with Angular style guidelines.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
  Based on code inspection, there are no apparent issues; however, since runtime errors depend on the execution environment and integration details, there is a 90% confidence level. Actual console behavior would require testing in a live environment.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
  The code appropriately uses features such as type annotations, interfaces for data models, and type hints in function parameters and return types.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
  The provided code is clean, with only optional commentary included for explanations. No TODOs or deprecated code are present.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design  
  The migration distinctly separates concerns: components handle view logic, services manage persistence, and NgRx handles state management. This demonstrates adherence to the single responsibility principle.
