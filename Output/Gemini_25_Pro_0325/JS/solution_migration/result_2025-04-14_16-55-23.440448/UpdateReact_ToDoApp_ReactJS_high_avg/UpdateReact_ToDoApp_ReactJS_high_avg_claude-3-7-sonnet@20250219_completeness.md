# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed
  
  The implementation correctly handles adding new todos when the Enter key is pressed in the input field. The `handleNewTodoKeyDown` function in `App.tsx` checks for the Enter key event, trims the input value, dispatches the `addTodo` action, and clears the input field.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter
  
  The application successfully implements filtered todo display through the `selectFilteredTodos` selector in `todosSlice.ts`. The `TodoList` component uses this selector to display only the todos that match the current filter condition.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos
  
  The toggle all functionality is properly implemented in `App.tsx` with the `handleToggleAll` function that dispatches the `toggleAll` action when the checkbox state changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted
  
  The `TodoItem` component includes proper implementation for all required actions:
  - Toggling: `handleToggle` function dispatches `toggleTodo`
  - Editing: `handleEdit` function initiates editing mode
  - Deleting: `handleDestroy` function dispatches `destroyTodo`

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode
  
  Double-clicking is properly handled in the `TodoItem` component with the `onDoubleClick={handleEdit}` event on the label element, which dispatches the `startEditing` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo
  
  The `handleKeyDown` function in `TodoItem` correctly checks for the Enter key and calls `handleSubmit` which dispatches the `saveTodo` action with the updated title.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value
  
  The `handleKeyDown` function in `TodoItem` also correctly handles the Escape key by resetting the edit text to the original todo title and dispatching the `cancelEditing` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The `Footer` component correctly displays the active item count using the `selectActiveTodoCount` selector and properly pluralizes the text using the `pluralize` utility function.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The `Footer` component includes the three filter links (All, Active, Completed) with proper URL hash navigation. The `useHashChange` custom hook handles the routing based on these hash changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos
  
  The `Footer` component includes a "Clear completed" button that is conditionally rendered when there are completed todos, and it properly dispatches the `clearCompleted` action when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence
  
  The application properly implements localStorage persistence through the `loadState` and `saveState` utility functions. The state is loaded on initialization in the `todosSlice.ts` file, and changes are saved through a throttled store subscription in `store.ts`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state
  
  The application correctly implements conditional rendering:
  - The main section is only shown when there are todos
  - The footer is only shown when there are todos
  - The "Clear completed" button is only shown when there are completed todos

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count
  
  The application uses a `pluralize` utility function that correctly returns singular or plural forms based on the count. This is used in the Footer component to display "item left" or "items left".

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components
  
  The code is well-structured with separate components for different concerns:
  - `App.tsx`: Main container and input field
  - `TodoList.tsx`: Renders the list of todos
  - `TodoItem.tsx`: Handles individual todo rendering and interactions
  - `Footer.tsx`: Manages filters and item counts

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality
  
  The code follows a proper organization structure:
  - `features/todos`: Contains Redux slice and types specific to todos
  - `components`: Contains UI components
  - `hooks`: Contains custom hooks
  - `utils`: Contains utility functions
  - `store`: Contains Redux store configuration
  - Constants are separated into their own file
