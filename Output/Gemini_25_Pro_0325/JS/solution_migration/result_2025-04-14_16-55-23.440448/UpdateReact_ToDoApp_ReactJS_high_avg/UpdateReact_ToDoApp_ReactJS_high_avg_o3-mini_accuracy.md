# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all React imports use React 18.x compatible syntax  
  All imports and usage (e.g., using createRoot from "react-dom/client") conform to React 18.x conventions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all components use functional component syntax with hooks instead of class components  
  All components (e.g., App, TodoItem, TodoList, Footer) are implemented as functional components using hooks.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Redux Toolkit's createSlice is used for state management  
  The state management is implemented via createSlice in the todosSlice.ts file.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for all props, state, and Redux store  
  Interfaces for Todo, TodosState, FilterStatus, and prop types for components are defined clearly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses immutable state updates in reducers  
  Immutable updates are handled through Redux Toolkit’s Immer integration inside createSlice.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that nanoid is used for ID generation instead of custom UUID implementation  
  The code employs nanoid (imported from 'nanoid') to generate IDs for todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application uses React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate  
  React.memo is used on components such as TodoItem, TodoList, and Footer to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that useCallback is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders  
  Event handlers in multiple components are memoized using useCallback.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage handling is implemented in a modern way  
  The utils.ts file manages localStorage via try/catch blocks and JSON parsing/stringifying, which is modern and safe.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows consistent naming conventions throughout the application  
  Naming conventions are clear and consistent across files, components, and Redux slices.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that proper error handling is implemented where necessary  
  The code includes error handling in localStorage functions and verifies the existence of the root element in index.tsx. While most error cases are handled, additional error boundaries could be considered, hence 95%.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware  
  The store is set up using configureStore, which includes sensible defaults and leverages configureStore’s built‐in middleware. Throttled persistence is implemented without detracting from the store’s configuration.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that React.lazy is used for code splitting where appropriate  
  The code does not incorporate React.lazy for code splitting. No components are loaded lazily even though such an approach could enhance performance for larger applications.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the codebase has no TODOs remaining  
  There are no lingering TODO comments in the provided code snippet.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux Provider wraps the application entry point  
  The entry point (index.tsx) correctly wraps the App component with the Redux Provider.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure strict TypeScript type checking is implemented throughout the application  
  The tsconfig.json file has "strict": true alongside other strict settings ensuring comprehensive type checking.
