# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The main App component listens for the Enter key (both by checking event.key and event.keyCode) on the new todo input field. When pressed, it dispatches the addTodo action and clears the input field.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The TodoList component uses a selector (selectFilteredTodos) that considers the current filter state and maps over the filtered todos, ensuring correct display.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  The App component includes an input (with id "toggle-all") that calls the toggleAll action on change. This enables marking all todos as complete or incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  The TodoItem component implements toggling via a checkbox, editing through double-click (which sets editing mode), and deletion via a dedicated destroy button.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  The TodoItem component listens for a double-click on the label, which triggers the handleEdit function and dispatches startEditing, thus entering editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  In edit mode, the TodoItem component listens for the Enter key (using both event.key and event.keyCode) and calls handleSubmit, which dispatches the saveTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  When the Escape key is pressed (checked via event.key and event.keyCode), the TodoItem resets the local edit state to the original todo title and dispatches cancelEditing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  The Footer component uses a selector (selectActiveTodoCount) to display the count of active todos within the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The Footer component renders filter links (“All”, “Active”, “Completed”) that visually indicate the current filter using conditional CSS classes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  A “Clear completed” button is rendered in the Footer when there are completed todos, and it dispatches the clearCompleted action when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  The application integrates loadState and saveState functions for localStorage operations and subscribes to store changes using a throttled save mechanism.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  Conditional rendering is implemented (e.g., the main section is rendered only if there are todos, and the Footer returns null when no todos exist).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes "item" text correctly based on count  
  The Footer uses a pluralize utility function to correctly display "item" or "items" based on the active todo count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The code is modularized into focused components (App, TodoList, TodoItem, Footer), along with dedicated slices, hooks, and utilities.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The provided file structure segments code into features (todos), components, hooks, utilities, and store configuration, promoting maintainability and clarity.
