# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'
  
  The Header component is correctly implemented in `src/components/Header.tsx` with the title "Virtual Piano" in an h1 element with the class "header-title".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons
  
  The Controls component in `src/components/Controls.tsx` correctly implements a button container with two buttons labeled "Notes" and "Letters", each with appropriate classes and onClick handlers to toggle the display mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)
  
  The Piano component in `src/components/Piano.tsx` renders all white keys and sharp keys based on the defined data in `whiteKeysData` and `sharpKeysData`. The white keys are rendered directly and the sharp keys are contained within a `keys-sharp` div.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes
  
  The PianoKey component in `src/components/PianoKey.tsx` correctly sets `data-note` and `data-letter` attributes based on the keyData prop passed to it.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked
  
  The `audioService.ts` file correctly implements a sound mapper that loads audio files for each note. The `playNote` function is called when a key is interacted with in the `handleKeyInteractionStart` method.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)
  
  The PianoKey component adds the 'piano-key-active' class when the `isActive` prop is true, which will highlight the key. The `activeNotes` state in the App component is updated appropriately on key interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes
  
  The App component sets up keyboard event listeners in a useEffect hook that handle keydown and keyup events. These events map keyboard keys to piano notes using the keyMap and call the appropriate interaction handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked
  
  The App component manages a `displayMode` state that's updated via the Controls component. This state is passed to the Piano component to control the display of notes vs letters.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes
  
  The FullscreenButton component correctly implements the Fullscreen API with proper event listeners for fullscreen changes and includes the toggleFullscreen function.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly
  
  The App component uses a Set for `activeNotes` and the Piano component handles multiple active notes. Additionally, the `pressedKeysRef` is used to track keyboard keys being held down, preventing duplicate events.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys
  
  The Piano component implements the onMouseMove handler that checks if the mouse button is pressed (event.buttons === 1) and triggers interaction for the key under the cursor if it's not already active.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information
  
  The Footer component in `src/components/Footer.tsx` renders the current year dynamically using `new Date().getFullYear()`.
