# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'  
  The Header component clearly renders an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element with the text "Virtual Piano". This meets the requirement reliably.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons  
  The Controls component renders two buttons labeled "Notes" and "Letters" respectively, and they update the display mode when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)  
  The Piano component maps over the provided <code>whiteKeysData</code> and <code>sharpKeysData</code> arrays. All natural and sharp keys are rendered, including handling placeholders correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes  
  Each PianoKey component sets <code>data-note</code> and <code>data-letter</code> attributes based on the provided key data. Even though placeholder keys may omit inner content, the actual keys are marked appropriately.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked  
  The code calls <code>playNote(note)</code> on key interaction. Audio files are mapped in <code>audioService.ts</code> with the corresponding note names. Confidence is 95% because while the mapping appears correct, the comment in the code indicates an assumption regarding file naming which developers should verify against actual assets.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)  
  The application uses the <code>activeNotes</code> state, and PianoKey components conditionally apply the <code>piano-key-active</code> class when their note is active. This reliably highlights pressed keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes  
  Global keyboard event listeners (keydown and keyup) are used to trigger key interactions via the <code>keyMap</code>. This ensures that pressing the corresponding letter keys activates the proper piano notes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked  
  The state managed in the App component and passed as props to both the Controls and Piano components ensures that toggling between display modes works as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes  
  The FullscreenButton component implements the Fullscreen API with request and exit methods and updates its state based on fullscreen changes. This meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly  
  The use of a Set for <code>activeNotes</code> and a ref (<code>pressedKeysRef</code>) for keyboard events indicates support for multiple key presses. Although the handling appears robust, simultaneous interaction might require further testing in varied environments, hence a slight cautious rating.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys  
  The Piano componentâ€™s mouse event handlers (onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseLeave, onMouseMove) allow triggering note activations during mouse drags. The implementation follows the expected behavior, though exact responsiveness on a drag across keys might depend on user interaction specifics.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information  
  The Footer component correctly renders the current year using <code>new Date().getFullYear()</code>, meeting the requirement.
