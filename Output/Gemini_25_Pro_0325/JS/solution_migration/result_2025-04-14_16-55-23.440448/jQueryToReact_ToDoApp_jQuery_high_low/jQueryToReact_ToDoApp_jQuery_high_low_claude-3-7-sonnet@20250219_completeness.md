  Each "TodoItem" component includes a checkbox with className "toggle" for toggling completion status, a label for displaying the title, and a "destroy" button for deletion.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode
  
  The "TodoItem" component includes an "onDoubleClick" handler on the label that sets "isEditing" state to true, which then renders an input field for editing.
