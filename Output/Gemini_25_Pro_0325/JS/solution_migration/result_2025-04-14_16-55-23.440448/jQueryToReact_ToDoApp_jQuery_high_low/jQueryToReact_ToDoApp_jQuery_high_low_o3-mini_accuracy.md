# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18.x  
  The code uses ReactDOM.createRoot (in index.tsx), which is a React 18 API.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript for type safety  
  All source files have proper .ts or .tsx extensions and include type definitions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for state management  
  The todosSlice is properly created using createSlice from Redux Toolkit.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm nanoid is used for generating unique IDs  
  The prepare callback in the addTodo reducer uses nanoid to generate a unique id.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code uses functional components with hooks instead of class components  
  All components are written as functional components using React hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains the same routing functionality with proper route handling  
  The App component includes a useEffect that listens to hash changes and dispatches the correct filter based on the URL.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Redux store is properly configured with appropriate slices  
  The store is configured in store.ts with the todos slice combined under the key "todos".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the Redux provider is set up in the application entry point  
  index.tsx wraps the application in the Provider from react‑redux with the properly configured store.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for all data structures  
  Interfaces for Todo and FilterType are defined and used appropriately throughout the codebase.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the code follows React best practices for component composition  
  The code is modular and organized into well-defined components using hooks. Although it generally follows best practices, some optimizations (e.g., memoization for highly re-rendering components) are not explicitly implemented. This does not detract from overall adherence but is noted as a mild area for potential improvement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles keyboard events properly  
  Keyboard events are handled in NewTodoInput (detecting the Enter key to add a todo) and in TodoItem (handling Enter for submission and Escape for cancellation).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application maintains local storage persistence if implemented  
  The loadState function, along with the useEffect in App.tsx that saves the todos to localStorage, confirm persistence.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  The code is well-structured and includes try/catch blocks (in localStorage functions), suggesting minimal runtime errors. However, since the code has not been executed in a live environment, there is slight uncertainty regarding unforeseen warnings or errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application implements proper error handling  
  Attempts to load and save state from localStorage are wrapped in try/catch blocks, demonstrating attention to error handling.

- **Pass** (85%): Confirm the code is optimized with no unnecessary re-renders  
  The application’s structure appears efficient for a small-to-medium size TodoMVC app. However, there are no explicit performance optimizations (such as React.memo or useCallback) shown, which might be considered if scaling up. This results in a slightly lower confidence level in optimization under heavy use.
