# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos  
  The application’s header is implemented in App.tsx with a <header> element containing an <h1> title ("todos") and the <NewTodoInput /> component that renders an input for creating todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos  
  The MainSection component conditionally renders when there are todos and includes the ToggleAllCheckbox component and TodoList component that displays the list of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button  
  In the TodoItem component, a checkbox input toggles the completion state, a <label> displays the todo title, and a button with class "destroy" provides the delete functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode  
  The TodoItem component binds the onDoubleClick event on the label to trigger editing mode, which switches the display to show an editable input field.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The FilterLinks component and the hash change management in App.tsx enable filtering based on "all", "active", or "completed" statuses.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization  
  The Footer component computes activeCount and displays the proper singular ("item") or plural ("items") according to the count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter  
  The FilterLinks component applies a "selected" class conditionally to the active filter link based on the application state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist  
  The Footer component conditionally renders a "Clear completed" button when the count of completed todos is greater than zero.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter  
  The NewTodoInput component listens for the Enter key event and dispatches the addTodo action after trimming the input value.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos  
  Each TodoItem includes a checkbox input that, upon change, dispatches the toggleTodo action to update the todo’s completed status.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once  
  The ToggleAllCheckbox component uses the toggleAll action to set the completion status of all todos when the checkbox is changed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management  
  The TodoItem component manages editing mode with internal state and uses a useEffect hook to autofocus the editing input with proper cursor placement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos  
  The TodoItem component includes a delete button that dispatches the deleteTodo action when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos  
  The Footer component contains a "Clear completed" button that dispatches the clearCompleted action to remove completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status  
  The selectFilteredTodos selector in the Redux slice correctly returns the list of todos according to the current filter ("all", "active", or "completed").
