# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all required technologies are present: Vite, TypeScript, React, Redux, and React Router  
  All required technologies can be seen across the project files. Vite is configured in vite.config.ts, TypeScript is used with tsconfig.json, React with JSX and TSX files, Redux is set up with Redux Toolkit, and React Router is used in App.tsx.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm documentation includes all available CLI commands with explanations for each command's purpose  
  The README.md clearly outlines the CLI commands (dev, build, lint, preview, test, test:watch) along with detailed explanations for the purpose and usage of each command.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that package.json includes all necessary dependencies for the required technologies  
  The package.json contains dependencies for React, Redux Toolkit, React Router DOM, Vite, and the associated development dependencies, ensuring proper support for all required technologies.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the project contains complete configuration files without placeholder comments or TODOs  
  All configuration files (vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json, tsconfig.node.json, jest.config.ts, setupTests.ts) are fully detailed and lack incomplete placeholder comments or TODOs.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the presence of proper TypeScript type definitions throughout the project  
  TypeScript configurations are robust, with strict settings in tsconfig.json. The code includes type annotations, interface definitions (e.g., in Greeting.tsx and counterSlice.ts), and proper usage of type definitions in hooks and Redux store setup.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure testing library configuration is complete with necessary setup files  
  The provided Jest config and the setupTests.ts file show that the testing setup is complete, including mappings and environment configurations for the testing library.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the project structure includes directories for components, state management, and routing  
  The project structure is well-organized with dedicated directories for components, features (state management), pages (routing), and application configuration, satisfying this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the entry point files for the application are properly defined  
  The index.html serves as the correct HTML entry point and main.tsx in the src folder correctly bootstraps the React application.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all configuration follows established best practices for each technology  
  All configurations (ESLint, Jest, Vite, TypeScript) adhere to widely-accepted best practices with clear and standard settings for a modern React-Redux-TS app.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that build and environment configuration supports production deployment  
  The Vite configuration includes production build settings (e.g., outDir, sourcemap) and the TypeScript setup ensures type safety, which collectively support a reliable production deployment.
