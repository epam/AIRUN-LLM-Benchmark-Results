  - Includes source map generation for production debugging

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm TypeScript is properly configured with a tsconfig.json file containing correct compiler options
  
  The TypeScript configuration is complete and well-structured:
  - `tsconfig.json` has appropriate settings for a React application
  - Includes strict type checking
  - Configures path aliases (`@/*`) for improved imports
  - `tsconfig.node.json` specifically configures TypeScript for Node.js environment files

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the React setup includes necessary entry points and proper component structure
  
  The React setup is complete with:
  - `index.html` entry point
  - `src/main.tsx` for React rendering with proper providers
  - Well-organized component structure with Layout, Pages, and Feature components
  - Proper separation of concerns between different parts of the application

- **Pass** (100%): Check that Redux is implemented with appropriate store configuration, reducers, and actions
  
  Redux is properly implemented with Redux Toolkit:
  - Store configuration in `src/app/store.ts`
  - Type-safe dispatch and selector hooks in `src/hooks/reduxHooks.ts`
  - Example counter slice with actions, reducers, and selectors
  - Proper typing for state and actions

- **Pass** (100%): Verify React Router is correctly configured with defined routes and navigation components
  
  React Router v6 is correctly implemented:
  - BrowserRouter in main.tsx
  - Routes configuration in `src/routes/AppRoutes.tsx`
  - Layout component with navigation links and Outlet for nested routes
  - Example routes for Home and About pages
  - 404 route handling

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure testing libraries are properly configured with appropriate test setup files
  
  Testing is configured correctly:
  - Vitest configuration in vite.config.ts
  - Setup file at `src/setupTests.ts` importing React Testing Library
  - Coverage configuration with appropriate exclusions
  - Scripts for running tests in different modes (regular, UI, coverage)

- **Pass** (100%): Validate package.json includes correct dependencies with compatible version specifications
  
  The package.json includes:
  - All required dependencies (React, Redux, React Router, etc.)
  - Appropriate development dependencies for testing, linting, and building
  - Version specifications using ^ for flexibility
  - Node engine requirement (>=18.0.0)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm package.json contains scripts for development, building, and testing operations
  
  The package.json includes comprehensive scripts:
  - `dev` for development
  - `build` for production builds
  - `lint` for code linting
  - `format` for code formatting
  - `preview` for previewing builds
  - Various testing scripts (test, test:ui, test:coverage)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the project structure follows modern React development conventions
  
  The project structure is well-organized following best practices:
  - Feature-based organization with the counter example
  - Separation of components, pages, and routes
  - Dedicated directories for hooks, store, and assets
  - Clear separation between application code and configuration

- **Pass** (100%): Check that configuration files are production-ready with appropriate optimization settings
  
  Configuration files are production-ready:
  - ESLint configured for TypeScript and React
  - Prettier for consistent code formatting
  - Vite build optimizations with sourcemaps
  - Comprehensive .gitignore file
  - Appropriate linting rules for production code
