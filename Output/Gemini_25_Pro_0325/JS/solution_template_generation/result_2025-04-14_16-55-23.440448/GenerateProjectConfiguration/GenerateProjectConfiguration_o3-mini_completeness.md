# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all required technologies are present: Vite, TypeScript, React, Redux, and React Router  
  All these technologies are clearly integrated: Vite is used as the build tool; TypeScript is configured via tsconfig files; React is present in the source files; Redux is implemented using Redux Toolkit with a store configuration; and React Router is used in AppRoutes and Layout components.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm documentation includes all available CLI commands with explanations for each command's purpose  
  The README.md section thoroughly explains each script in package.json (dev, build, lint, format, preview, test, test:ui, test:coverage) with clear usage instructions and the purpose behind each command.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that package.json includes all necessary dependencies for the required technologies  
  The package.json lists dependencies such as react, react-dom, react-redux, @reduxjs/toolkit, and react-router-dom. Dev dependencies include TypeScript, ESLint plugins, and Vitest for testing.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the project contains complete configuration files without placeholder comments or TODOs  
  All configuration files (vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json, tsconfig.node.json, .eslintrc.cjs, .prettierrc.json, etc.) are fully fleshed out with proper settings and without leftover placeholders or TODOs.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the presence of proper TypeScript type definitions throughout the project  
  Type definitions are properly set up (e.g., @types/react, @types/react-dom in package.json), and custom hooks as well as Redux store and slices utilize TypeScript types appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure testing library configuration is complete with necessary setup files  
  The project includes vitest configuration within vite.config.ts; the setup file (src/setupTests.ts) is present to extend testing-library functionalities, and the configuration specifies globals, environment, and coverage details.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the project structure includes directories for components, state management, and routing  
  The provided project structure clearly separates components (src/components), state management (src/app, src/features), and routing (src/routes), along with other necessary directories.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the entry point files for the application are properly defined  
  The application entry point is well-defined with index.html, src/main.tsx, and src/App.tsx, which correctly bootstrap and render the application with proper routing and state management integration.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all configuration follows established best practices for each technology  
  The configurations adhere to best practices: Vite is configured with production settings and HMR; TypeScript settings enforce strictness and type safety; ESLint and Prettier are properly set up; and Redux/React Router are integrated following standard patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that build and environment configuration supports production deployment  
  The build configuration in vite.config.ts is designed for production with sourcemap generation and proper output directory settings. The package.json scripts (build and preview) also support creating and testing a production-ready deployment.
