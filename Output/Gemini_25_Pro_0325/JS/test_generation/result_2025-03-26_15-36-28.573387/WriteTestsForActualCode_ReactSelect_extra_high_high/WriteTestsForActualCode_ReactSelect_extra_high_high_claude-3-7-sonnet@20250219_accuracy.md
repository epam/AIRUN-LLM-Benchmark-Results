# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up in the test file
    
    The test file correctly includes setup for Jest and React Testing Library. It mentions the necessary dependencies to install and properly configures Jest in the `jest.config.js` file. The setup file `setupTests.ts` correctly imports and configures testing-library/jest-dom and mocks necessary browser APIs.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test cases are properly isolated and do not have interdependencies
    
    Each test case is properly isolated using individual `it` blocks. The code uses `afterEach` cleanup and `jest.clearAllMocks()` to reset the environment between tests. The `renderSelect` helper function creates fresh instances and mocks for each test.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that DOM events are simulated using proper React Testing Library methods
    
    The code consistently uses `userEvent` from '@testing-library/user-event' for simulating user interactions, which is the recommended approach. It properly uses methods like `user.click()`, `user.type()`, and `user.keyboard()` to simulate events.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that accessibility attributes are being tested appropriately
    
    The test file includes a dedicated "Accessibility (ARIA)" section that thoroughly tests ARIA attributes like `aria-expanded`, `aria-activedescendant`, `aria-haspopup`, `aria-invalid`, and others. The tests verify these attributes are set correctly and change appropriately during interaction.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure mocks are used for external dependencies where appropriate
    
    The code properly mocks utility functions like `isTouchCapable`, `isMobileDevice`, `isAppleDevice`, etc. It also mocks browser APIs not available in JSDOM like `scrollIntoView`, `matchMedia`, and `ResizeObserver`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of async/await for asynchronous testing where needed
    
    The test file correctly uses async/await with user interactions and waitFor statements. For example: `await user.click(getControl())` and `await waitFor(() => expect(input).toHaveAttribute('aria-activedescendant', optionOne?.id))`.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all assertions use appropriate Jest matchers
    
    The assertions use appropriate Jest matchers and testing-library/jest-dom matchers, such as `toBeInTheDocument()`, `toHaveAttribute()`, `toHaveClass()`, `toHaveValue()`, `toBeDisabled()`, `toHaveFocus()`, `toHaveBeenCalledTimes()`, and `toHaveBeenCalledWith()`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that tests include proper cleanup after each test case
    
    The tests include proper cleanup with `cleanup()` from React Testing Library in the `afterEach` hook and also call `jest.clearAllMocks()` to reset mocks between tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test descriptions clearly indicate what functionality is being tested
    
    All test descriptions are clear and descriptive. For example: "opens menu on control click", "selects option on click", "renders disabled state", etc. These descriptions clearly indicate what functionality is being tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the test file follows best practices for organizing test cases (describe/it blocks)
    
    The test file is well-organized using nested `describe` blocks that group related tests together (Rendering, Interaction: Mouse, Interaction: Keyboard, State Management, Menu & Options, Accessibility, Edge Cases, Performance, Prop Variations). Each `it` block tests a specific piece of functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that all event handlers are tested using appropriate simulation methods
    
    The test file validates all event handlers (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose, onFocus, onBlur, onKeyDown) using appropriate simulation methods and checks they're called with the expected arguments.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the test environment correctly simulates both mouse and keyboard interactions
    
    The test file has separate sections for mouse interactions and keyboard interactions, thoroughly testing both types of interactions using the appropriate userEvent methods.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure tests for touch events properly simulate mobile interactions
    
    While the test file acknowledges the need to test
