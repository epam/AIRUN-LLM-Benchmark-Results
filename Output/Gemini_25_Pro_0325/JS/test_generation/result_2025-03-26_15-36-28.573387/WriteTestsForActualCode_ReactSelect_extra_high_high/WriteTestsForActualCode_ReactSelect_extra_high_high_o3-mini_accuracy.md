# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up in the test file  
  The provided answer shows a complete Jest configuration, a proper setup file for RTL, and sample usage of both jest and React Testing Library.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test cases are properly isolated and do not have interdependencies  
  The tests are neatly organized into describe/it blocks, employ a helper function for rendering, and cleanup is ensured via RTL’s cleanup and jest.clearAllMocks.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that DOM events are simulated using proper React Testing Library methods  
  Mouse and keyboard events are simulated through userEvent and fireEvent, accurately reflecting real user interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that accessibility attributes are being tested appropriately  
  The tests cover ARIA attributes (e.g., aria-expanded, aria-controls, aria-label) and verify proper behavior during interaction.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure mocks are used for external dependencies where appropriate  
  External utilities and browser-specific features (e.g., scrollIntoView, matchMedia, ResizeObserver) are mocked appropriately to isolate component behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of async/await for asynchronous testing where needed  
  The test cases correctly utilize async functions, await on user events, and use waitFor to handle asynchronous DOM updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all assertions use appropriate Jest matchers  
  The answer makes use of matchers like toBeInTheDocument, toHaveAttribute, toHaveBeenCalledTimes, etc., which are standard for robust testing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that tests include proper cleanup after each test case  
  Cleanup is performed with afterEach (using RTL’s cleanup and jest.clearAllMocks), ensuring no side effects between test cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test descriptions clearly indicate what functionality is being tested  
  Each test case is clearly named in the it blocks, providing a clear understanding of the intended functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the test file follows best practices for organizing test cases (describe/it blocks)  
  The tests are grouped logically into multiple describe blocks covering rendering, interactions, state management, accessibility, and edge cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that all event handlers are tested using appropriate simulation methods  
  Handlers like onChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose, onFocus, and onBlur are simulated using userEvent and are tested with proper assertions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the test environment correctly simulates both mouse and keyboard interactions  
  Mouse interactions (clicks) and keyboard interactions (Arrow keys, Escape, Enter, Tab, etc.) are simulated accurately.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure tests for touch events properly simulate mobile interactions  
  Although the answer mentions touch events (with comments and TODOs), it does not provide actual tests simulating mobile/touch interactions. This leaves a gap in coverage for touch-specific events.  
  Explanation: The answer includes comments regarding touch events (e.g., onControlTouchEnd) and mentions that user-event might cover basic taps but does not include concrete tests or usage of fireEvent to simulate specific touch gestures.
