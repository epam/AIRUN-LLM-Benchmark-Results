# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verified that tests for basic component rendering with default props exist. The test "renders with default props" in the "Rendering" block confirms this.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirmed that tests for keyboard navigation functionality (Arrow keys, Tab, Enter, Escape) are present. The "Interaction: Keyboard" section includes tests for ArrowDown, ArrowUp, Space, Escape, and Enter key interactions.

- **Fail** (90%): Validated mouse interaction tests. While there are extensive tests for clicking (opening/closing the menu, selecting options, clearing values), there is no explicit test for mouse hovering. This results in a partial failure because the evaluation step explicitly mentions hovering as well as clicking.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirmed test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior. There are tests verifying controlled prop behavior (e.g., updates to value, inputValue, menuIsOpen) and appropriate callbacks.

- **Pass** (100%): Verified tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values. Multiple tests (such as "selects option on click", "removes option on click in multi-select", and "clears value on clear indicator click") confirm this.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensured tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented. The tests cover various triggers including mouse clicks and keyboard events that open/close the menu.

- **Pass** (100%): Validated test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality. The test "filters options based on input change" confirms that filtered results are correctly handled.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirmed tests for multi-select behavior exist. Multiple tests verify multi-select addition, removal, and the correct rendering of multi-value options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verified tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility. Tests check for correct aria-* attributes, live region presence, and state updates during interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensured edge cases like empty options are tested. Tests for "renders noOptionsMessage when options are empty" and "handles null options gracefully" demonstrate this.

- **Pass** (100%): Validated tests for loading and error states. For loading, tests such as "renders loading indicator" and "renders loadingMessage when isLoading and menu is open" are present, and error states are partly covered via ARIA error attributes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verified tests for disabled options/states. There are multiple tests which check that the component handles disabled options and disabled states correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirmed tests for large option sets to verify performance exist. The performance test "renders reasonably fast with many options" ensures performance considerations.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensured focus management during interactions is properly tested. Tests confirm focus changes on control click, keyboard navigation, and proper blur handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verified tests for placeholder and value rendering. There are tests checking that placeholders render when no value is present and values render appropriately when selected.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensured test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations. The test "formats option label using formatOptionLabel" shows that custom label formatting is correctly applied.

- **Pass** (100%): Verified callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose) are appropriately tested. Multiple tests use these callbacks to assert correct behavior upon user interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validated tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading) exist. Specific tests verify that dropdown indicators, clear indicators, and loading indicators render when they should.
