# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)
  
  The answer clearly specifies using Jasmine as the testing framework with Karma as the test runner, which are appropriate modern testing tools for AngularJS applications. The answer includes configuration for both (`karma.conf.js`), and all test files follow Jasmine's syntax with `describe`, `it`, `beforeEach`, and `expect` functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints
  
  The answer demonstrates proper mocking of $resource in multiple ways:
  
  1. In the REST factory test, it spies on $resource methods to verify correct endpoint configuration
  2. In controller tests, it creates a comprehensive mock REST service with spies for all needed methods
  3. All REST API endpoints are properly mocked to return promises that simulate API responses

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation
  
  The code extensively uses `beforeEach` hooks to set up the testing environment before each test:
  - Loading the 'cosmo' module
  - Setting up mock services and spies
  - Creating a fresh scope and controller instance
  
  The code also uses `afterEach` hooks to verify no outstanding HTTP expectations or requests and to reset spy histories when needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls
  
  The answer shows proper mocking of HTTP requests in two ways:
  1. By using `$httpBackend` from Angular mocks (mentioned in the setup)
  2. By creating mock REST services that return promised results without making actual HTTP calls
  
  All API calls are properly mocked and no real network requests would be made during these tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection
  
  The tests properly use AngularJS dependency injection patterns:
  - Using the `inject` function to get services
  - Using the underscore naming convention (e.g., `_$controller_`) to handle injection
  - Properly injecting all required dependencies into the controller being tested
  - Providing mock versions of services where needed

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations
  
  The tests demonstrate correct handling of promises and asynchronous operations:
  - Using `$q` to create mock promises
  - Calling `$rootScope.$apply()` to resolve promises in tests
  - Using `spyOn` with `.and.callFake()` to return mock promises
  - Testing both success and error callback scenarios
  - Verifying that operations happen after promises resolve

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies
  
  The answer shows extensive and correct use of spies and mocks:
  - Creating comprehensive mock objects for REST, Page, and Users services
  - Using `jasmine.createSpy()` to track method calls
  - Using `.and.callFake()` to provide mock implementations
  - Spying on Angular services like `$location`, `$rootScope.$broadcast`, and `$translate`
  - Spying on browser APIs like `localStorage`

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization
  
  The tests follow a clear organizational structure:
  - Top-level `describe` blocks for each component being tested
  - Nested `describe` blocks for logical grouping of related functionality
  - Well-named `it` blocks that clearly state what's being tested
  - Logical progression from simple to complex tests

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls
  
  The tests cover both success and error scenarios:
  - Testing successful API responses with mock data
  - Testing error scenarios using error callbacks
  - Verifying correct error handling behavior (error notifications, preventing further actions)
  - Testing edge cases like empty responses or partial data

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate
  
  The tests simulate user interactions by directly calling the controller methods that would be triggered by user actions:
  - Calling `scope.titleChange()` to simulate a user typing in the title
  - Calling `scope.urlChange()` to simulate a user changing the URL
