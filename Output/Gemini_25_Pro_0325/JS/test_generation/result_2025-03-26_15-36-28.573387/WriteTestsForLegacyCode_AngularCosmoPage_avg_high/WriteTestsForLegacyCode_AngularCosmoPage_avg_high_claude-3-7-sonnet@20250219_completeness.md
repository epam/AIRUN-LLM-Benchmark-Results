# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources
  
  The evaluation confirms complete coverage for the REST factory. The tests verify all 16 resources (blocks, blocksRequirements, comments, content, contentExtras, contentRevisions, contentRevisionsExtras, contentTags, files, filesTags, menus, modules, sitemaps, themes, settings, users) and their proper configuration with correct URLs, parameters, and HTTP methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly
  
  The Page factory tests thoroughly verify that all properties (id, title, description, header, subheader, body, url, type, published_date, themePages, timestamp, extras, misc) initialize with their correct default values. Tests also confirm that properties can be updated correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly
  
  Tests for the Users factory verify that all properties (id, username, name, bio, email, facebook, twitter, photo, role) initialize with their correct default values and can be properly updated.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods
  
  The test suite provides exhaustive coverage for all public methods in the pageCtrl controller including deletePage(), localVersion(), deleteNewerVersion(), saveLocal(), updatePageType(), titleChange(), descriptionChange(), urlChange(), autocompleteTags(), selectSuggestion(), and savePage().

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller
  
  The tests thoroughly validate the controller initialization process, including setting defaults from the Page factory, handling route parameters, checking for newer versions in localStorage, and initializing the page type and schedule date correctly in various scenarios.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation
  
  The tests verify that the titleChange() function updates Page.title and properly auto-generates a URL when autoURL is true, including converting titles with special characters and spaces to URL-friendly formats. The tests also confirm that autoURL gets set to true when url is empty, 'new', or '/new'.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction
  
  The tests validate that saveLocal() correctly updates Page factory values from scope and saves the scope values to localStorage, including proper key generation using the URL prefix for title, description, url, publish, scheduleDate, and type.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality
  
  The test suite verifies that autocompleteTags() correctly calls REST.contentTags.query with the last tag if present, sets scope.page.suggestions on successful query, clears suggestions on failed query, and properly handles empty tags.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)
  
  The tests exhaustively cover all conditional paths in the savePage() function, including validation failures, new page creation, page updates, and duplication scenarios. Each path is tested with appropriate mocks and verifications.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types
  
  Edge cases are thoroughly tested, including empty URLs, "new" URLs, empty page types, empty titles (using header as fallback), duplicate URLs when duplicating a page, and handling of extras and tags.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly
  
  The tests validate that deletePage() properly calls REST.content.delete, REST.contentRevisions.delete, REST.contentRevisionsExtras.delete, REST.contentExtras.delete, and REST.contentTags.delete with the correct page ID, broadcasts notifications on success, and redirects correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions
  
  The tests verify proper handling of page versions in localStorage, including detecting newer versions, restoring local versions, deleting newer versions, and properly updating properties in localStorage during editing.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components
  
  While specific coverage percentages aren't provided, the tests appear to cover well over 80% of the code paths, including nearly all methods, edge cases, and error conditions. The test suite is extremely thorough, but
