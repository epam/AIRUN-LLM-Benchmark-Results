# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources  
  The tests in "test/services/rest.spec.js" use the helper function checkResource to verify the configuration of all resources (e.g. blocks, comments, content, etc.), ensuring each endpoint and its actions (including update when expected) are tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly  
  The "test/services/page.spec.js" contains tests that check each property (id, title, description, header, subheader, body, url, type, published_date, themePages, timestamp, extras, misc) is initialized as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly  
  The specifications in "test/services/users.spec.js" verify that all the expected properties (id, username, name, bio, email, facebook, twitter, photo, role) are properly set upon initialization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods  
  The extensive tests in "test/controllers/pageCtrl.spec.js" cover nearly every public method and interaction in the controller, including initialization, title changes, URL changes, localStorage interactions, deletion, event broadcasting, and save/update workflows.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller  
  Initialization is thoroughly checked by confirming that scope.page is populated with values from the Page factory and that defaults (e.g. for scheduleDate) are correctly applied in various scenarios (e.g. /new path).

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation  
  Multiple test cases demonstrate that when autoURL is true, the titleChange method properly auto-generates the URL from the page title. Scenarios when autoURL is forced false are also examined.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction  
  The test suite covers localStorage interactions within the "Local Storage Interaction" describe block. It verifies that localVersion restores values, that saveLocal writes the expected items, and that localStorage is cleared when appropriate.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality  
  The tests for autocompleteTags check that the query is called correctly when the last tag is present, that suggestions are assigned on successful responses, and that suggestions are cleared under failure or empty tag conditions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)  
  The savePage functionality is broken into several describe blocks that handle duplicate detection, new page creation (/new), scheduling/publishing logic, and updating an existing page. This covers the different branches and error conditions effectively.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types  
  There are dedicated tests that check the reaction when the page type is empty or when the URL is empty/new, ensuring proper error notifications and stopping of further actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly  
  The "Page Deletion" section contains multiple tests confirming that calls to delete the content, its revisions, extras, and tags are made correctly and that subsequent UI actions (notification, redirection) are executed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions  
  Tests for localVersion, deleteNewerVersion, and related events demonstrate that the controller correctly handles version differences between localStorage and the Page factory.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components  
  Although no explicit code coverage metrics are provided, the extensive test cases across multiple files and scenarios indicate comprehensive coverage. There is some uncertainty in the exact numerical coverage, but the depth and breadth suggest that coverage is well above 80%.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling  
  The tests explicitly verify that events (e.g. "notify", "contentGet", "settingsGet") are broadcast and handled as expected throughout the controllerâ€™s logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality  
  Several tests in both the "Initialization" and "savePage() - Schedule Date Logic" sections confirm that scheduleDate is correctly interpreted, including validations for future (scheduled), past (published), and undefined setup for drafts.
