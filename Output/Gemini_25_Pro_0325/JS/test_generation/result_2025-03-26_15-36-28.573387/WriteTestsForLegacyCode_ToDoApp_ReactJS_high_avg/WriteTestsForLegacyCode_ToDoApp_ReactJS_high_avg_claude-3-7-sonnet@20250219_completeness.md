# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering
- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos
- **Pass** (95%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos

    The test file includes basic tests for the initial "All" filter state, but acknowledges limitations with testing the router's effects on filtering. The tests verify that all todos are shown initially and the "All" link is selected, but does not fully test switching between Active and Completed filters due to router coupling challenges. The test author explicitly comments on this limitation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events
- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts
- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation
- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data
- **Pass** (90%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented

    The code includes a Router mock in the setup file that provides basic functionality, but the implementation acknowledges limitations in fully testing the routing behavior. While the mock exists, the tests explicitly mention the challenges in testing the actual route changes and their effects on component state without modifying the source code. The mock provides a foundation for testing routing but does not fully simulate all routing interactions.
