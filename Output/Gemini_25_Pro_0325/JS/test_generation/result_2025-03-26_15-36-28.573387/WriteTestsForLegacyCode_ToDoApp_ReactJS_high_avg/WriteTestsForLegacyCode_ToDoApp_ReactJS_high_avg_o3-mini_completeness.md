# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering  
  The app.tsx test file includes tests such as "should render the header and input field" and checks for the presence of the main section and footer.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos  
  The tests "should call model.addTodo on Enter key press with non-empty value" and its variants demonstrate that adding todos is properly tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos  
  The "Toggle All" describe block contains tests that check both checking and unchecking of the toggle-all checkbox.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos  
  There is a dedicated "Routing / Filtering" section in app.test.tsx that verifies the default (ALL_TODOS) filter and discusses how filtering is handled.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The test file includes tests for the "Clear completed" button, ensuring it is displayed correctly and that it triggers model.clearCompleted when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering  
  The todoItem.test.tsx file includes tests for rendering in both view mode and completed state, ensuring proper content display.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos  
  The tests cover clicking the checkbox to toggle, clicking the destroy button, and double-clicking the label to enter edit mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events  
  The file includes tests for key events such as handling the Enter key (with trimming), Escape key (to cancel editing), and blur (to save changes).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts  
  The footer tests include separate cases for singular and plural active todo counts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation  
  The test file validates that filter links are rendered correctly and that their "selected" classes are applied appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The tests check for the presence/absence of the "Clear completed" button and verify that clicking it calls the onClearCompleted callback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos  
  The todoModel.test.ts file contains tests that verify addTodo, toggle, save, destroy, and other operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions  
  There is a dedicated test that subscribes a listener and confirms that notify/inform triggers the callback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The tests cover scenarios for removing completed todos and ensuring proper behavior when no todos are completed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation  
  The uuid function is tested for type, uniqueness, and format.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality  
  The tests confirm that pluralize returns the correct singular or plural string based on input count.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations  
  The tests validate storing, retrieving, and handling invalid JSON scenarios for localStorage interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function  
  The extend function is tested with multiple scenarios including merging objects and handling empty inputs.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx  
  Most React component tests use the .test.tsx extension; non-React utility or model tests use .test.ts which is common. Although the instruction specifies [filename].test.tsx, the use of .test.ts for non-UI code is acceptable.  
  Explanation: There is a slight naming discrepancy for non-component files, but it adheres to common practice.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data  
  The tests consistently use sample todo data (e.g., mockTodo, initialTodos) for their test cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented  
  The Router is mocked in setupTests.ts and there is a "Routing / Filtering" section in app.test.tsx that discusses the approach to simulate routing behavior.
