# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up in the test file

    The test file correctly sets up Jest and React Testing Library with appropriate imports:
    ```javascript
    import React from 'react';
    import { render, screen, fireEvent, waitFor, act } from '@testing-library/react';
    import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';
    ```
    
    The setup also includes a comprehensive `setupTests.ts` configuration that mocks browser APIs not available in JSDOM.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test cases are properly isolated and do not have interdependencies

    Each test case is properly isolated using:
    - Clear `beforeEach()` blocks that reset mocks
    - Individual test cases that don't rely on state from previous tests
    - The `renderSelect` helper function that creates a fresh component instance for each test

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that DOM events are simulated using proper React Testing Library methods

    The test suite properly uses:
    - `userEvent` for most interactions (`click`, `type`, `keyboard`, `hover`)
    - `fireEvent` for specialized events like touch events
    - Example: `await user.click(getControl())`, `await user.keyboard('{ArrowDown}')`

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that accessibility attributes are being tested appropriately

    The test file has a dedicated "Accessibility" section that thoroughly tests:
    - ARIA roles (`combobox`, `listbox`, `option`)
    - ARIA attributes (`aria-expanded`, `aria-disabled`, `aria-activedescendant`)
    - Custom ARIA attributes (`aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-invalid`, `aria-errormessage`)
    - Live region rendering

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure mocks are used for external dependencies where appropriate

    The test file uses mocks appropriately:
    - Browser APIs (`scrollIntoView`, `matchMedia`, `ResizeObserver`)
    - Internal utilities (`isTouchCapable`, `isMobileDevice`)
    - Internal components (`MenuPlacer`, `LiveRegion`, `ScrollManager`)
    - Event handlers (`onChange`, `onInputChange`, etc.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of async/await for asynchronous testing where needed

    The test file correctly uses async/await for all asynchronous operations:
    - With userEvent: `await user.click(getControl())`
    - With screen.findBy queries: `await screen.findByRole('listbox')`
    - With waitFor: `await waitFor(() => { expect(...) })`

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all assertions use appropriate Jest matchers

    The test file uses appropriate Jest matchers throughout:
    - DOM element presence: `toBeInTheDocument()`, `not.toBeInTheDocument()`
    - Attribute checking: `toHaveAttribute()`, `toHaveClass()`, `toHaveValue()`
    - Element state: `toHaveFocus()`, `toBeDisabled()`
    - Mock verification: `toHaveBeenCalled()`, `toHaveBeenCalledWith()`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that tests include proper cleanup after each test case

    Cleanup is properly handled:
    - React Testing Library's `render` automatically unmounts components after each test
    - Mocks are reset in `beforeEach` with `jest.clearAllMocks()`
    - No manual DOM manipulation that would require cleanup

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test descriptions clearly indicate what functionality is being tested

    Test descriptions are clear and descriptive:
    - Describe blocks organize tests by functionality: "Rendering", "Menu and Options", "Keyboard Navigation"
    - Each test case has a descriptive name: "should open menu when control is clicked", "should cycle through options with ArrowDown/ArrowUp"

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the test file follows best practices for organizing test cases (describe/it blocks)

    The test organization follows best practices:
    - Logical grouping with nested describe blocks
    - Related functionality grouped together
    - Progressive complexity (basic rendering, then interactions, then edge cases)
    - Clear separation of concerns (keyboard vs. mouse vs. touch interactions)

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that all event handlers are tested using appropriate simulation methods

    All event handlers are properly tested:
    - `onChange`: Tested with option selection, clearing, and removing values
    - `onInputChange`: Tested with typing in the input
    - `onMenuOpen`/`onMenuClose`: Tested with opening/closing the menu
    - `onFocus`/`onBlur`: Tested with focusing/blurring the input

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the test environment correctly simulates both mouse and keyboard interactions

    The test file properly simulates:
    - Mouse interactions: `click`, `hover` events via userEvent
    - Keyboard interactions: Arrow keys, Enter, Tab, Escape, Backspace, Page Up/Down, Home/End
    - Focus management: Focus and blur events

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for touch events properly simulate mobile interactions

    Touch events are properly simulated:
    - Uses `fireEvent.touchStart`, `fireEvent.touchMove`, `fireEvent.touchEnd`
    - Mocks touch environment: `(utils.isTouchCapable as jest.Mock).mockReturnValue(true)`
    - Tests specific touch behaviors: Dragging, tapping indicators, opening/closing menu
