# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist
  
  The test file includes a comprehensive "Rendering" describe block with numerous tests for basic component rendering, including checking for the select container, control, input with default props, and other essential elements.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present
  
  The "Keyboard Navigation" section thoroughly tests all required keyboard interactions, including arrow key navigation, Enter key selection, Tab key behavior, Escape key for closing the menu, and additional keys like PageUp/Down and Home/End.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)
  
  The "Mouse Interaction" section tests clicking on options, clicking clear indicators, clicking remove buttons for multi-values, and option hovering behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior
  
  The "State Management (Controlled)" section specifically tests controlled component behavior for value, inputValue, and menuIsOpen, verifying that the component responds to prop changes but doesn't internally update controlled values.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values
  
  Tests for these state changes are covered across multiple sections, including tests for selecting options, clearing values with the clear indicator, and removing values in multi-select mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented
  
  Tests verify menu opens when control is clicked, when dropdown indicator is clicked, when ArrowDown/Up is pressed, and closes on Escape, selection, or clicking outside.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality
  
  Tests verify that typing in the input field filters options correctly, that "No options" message appears for no matches, and that onInputChange is called appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist
  
  Multiple tests specifically check multi-select behavior, including rendering multiple values, removing values with backspace or clicking remove buttons, and handling closeMenuOnSelect differently for multi-select.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility
  
  The "Accessibility" section tests correct roles (combobox, listbox, option), aria-expanded, aria-disabled, aria-activedescendant during navigation, and other accessibility attributes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested
  
  The "Edge Cases" section includes tests for empty options array, showing appropriate "No data" message.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states
  
  Tests verify that loading indicator appears when isLoading is true, and that aria-invalid and aria-errormessage attributes are applied correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states
  
  Tests check both disabled component state (preventing interactions) and disabled options (not selectable).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance
  
  The "Performance Considerations" section tests rendering with 200 options to ensure it doesn't crash.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested
  
  The "Focus Management" section specifically tests focus behavior, including onFocus/onBlur callbacks, input focus on menu open, and blurInputOnSelect behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering
  
  Tests check placeholder rendering when no value is selected, and correct rendering of both single and multi values.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations
  
  Tests for custom option formatting are included in the "Edge Cases" section, verifying custom getOptionLabel and getOptionValue functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)
  
  All callback functions are extensively tested across multiple interactions to ensure they're called with the correct parameters and at the right times.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)
  
  Tests verify rendering and interaction with indicator components, including dropdown indicator for toggling menu, clear indicator for removing values, and loading indicator appearance.
