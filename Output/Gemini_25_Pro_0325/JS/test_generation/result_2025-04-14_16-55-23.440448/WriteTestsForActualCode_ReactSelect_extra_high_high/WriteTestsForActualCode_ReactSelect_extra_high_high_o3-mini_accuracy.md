# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up in the test file  
  The test file includes installation instructions, proper configuration files (jest.config.js), and a dedicated setup file (`setupTests.ts`) that imports `@testing-library/jest-dom` and correctly mocks browser APIs.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test cases are properly isolated and do not have interdependencies  
  The tests use separate `describe` and `it` blocks, along with a `beforeEach` hook to clear mocks, ensuring isolation among test cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that DOM events are simulated using proper React Testing Library methods  
  The tests predominantly use `userEvent` and `fireEvent` where appropriate, simulating clicks, keyboard events, mouse hover, and touch events correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that accessibility attributes are being tested appropriately  
  The tests check for key accessibility attributes such as `aria-expanded`, `aria-disabled`, `aria-activedescendant`, `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, and `aria-invalid`, ensuring proper accessibility testing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure mocks are used for external dependencies where appropriate  
  External modules and components such as `MenuPlacer`, `LiveRegion`, `ScrollManager`, and utility functions are mocked to isolate the `Select` component logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of async/await for asynchronous testing where needed  
  The tests use `await` with asynchronous helpers like `userEvent.click`, `userEvent.keyboard`, and `waitFor`, ensuring that asynchronous behavior is handled correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all assertions use appropriate Jest matchers  
  The code utilizes a range of Jest matchers (e.g., `toBeInTheDocument`, `toHaveAttribute`, `toHaveClass`, `toBeDisabled`, `toHaveFocus`) which are well-suited for the tested conditions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that tests include proper cleanup after each test case  
  The use of `beforeEach(jest.clearAllMocks)` and the inherent automatic cleanup provided by React Testing Library ensure proper test isolation. Although an explicit `afterEach` cleanup is not shown, the setup is standard and sufficient.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test descriptions clearly indicate what functionality is being tested  
  The `describe` and `it` blocks include clear, descriptive titles that precisely indicate the functionality being evaluated.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the test file follows best practices for organizing test cases (describe/it blocks)  
  The test file is well-structured with modularized sections (Rendering, Menu and Options, User Interaction, State Management, Accessibility, Edge Cases, and Performance Considerations), following best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that all event handlers are tested using appropriate simulation methods  
  Each event-related functionality (clicks, keyboard events, touch events) is simulated using proper methods (`userEvent` and `fireEvent`), accurately testing the corresponding handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the test environment correctly simulates both mouse and keyboard interactions  
  The test cases include simulations for mouse clicks, keyboard navigation (Arrow keys, Enter, Tab, Escape, etc.), ensuring a realistic interaction scenario.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for touch events properly simulate mobile interactions  
  Touch events are simulated with `fireEvent` (using `touchStart`, `touchMove`, and `touchEnd`), appropriately reflecting mobile interactions.
