# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist  
  The provided test suite contains a full “Rendering” section that checks the container, control, input, placeholder, and hidden input elements.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present  
  Multiple tests under “Keyboard Navigation” cover arrow key movements, Tab, Enter, Escape, Backspace, PageUp/PageDown, Home/End—all simulating realistic keyboard interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)  
  The “Mouse Interaction” describe block includes tests for selecting options via click, hovering to focus options, clicking the clear indicator, and similar events.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior  
  Although the tests explicitly cover controlled behavior (with state managed via props) and verify that callbacks like onChange are called while the UI does not update internally, they do not explicitly isolate uncontrolled behavior. Still, the defaultTestProps and rendering tests imply uncontrolled behavior by default.  
  Explanation: Controlled behavior is well covered; uncontrolled state is indirectly verified via defaults.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values  
  Tests are present for selecting options, removing multi-select values (using Backspace and clicking removal icons), and clearing selections via the clear indicator.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented  
  The suite provides several tests that simulate opening the menu (clicking the control, using keyboard keys, touch events) and closing it (Escape key, selecting an option when closeMenuOnSelect is true).

- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality  
  There are tests that type into the input to filter the available options, check that matching options appear, and verify that a “No options” message is rendered when there are no matches.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist  
  The tests include scenarios for multi-select rendering, verifying multiple values, ensuring multi-value removal, and checking hidden inputs for multi-select forms.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility  
  Multiple tests confirm the correct roles (combobox, listbox, option), and verify attributes like aria-expanded, aria-disabled, aria-activedescendant, aria-label, aria-labelledby, aria-invalid, and aria-errormessage.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested  
  There is a dedicated test in the “Edge Cases” section that renders an empty options array and verifies that an appropriate “No data” message is shown.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate tests for loading and error states  
  The suite includes tests for the loading indicator when isLoading is true and for ARIA error attributes (aria-invalid and aria-errormessage).  
  Explanation: While the loading state is well covered, explicit UI error state behavior (beyond ARIA attributes) isn’t extensively tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states  
  The tests check for disabled options (including not selecting them and correct aria-disabled settings) and ensure that interactions are not allowed when the component is disabled.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance  
  A “Performance Considerations” section includes a test rendering 200 options and verifies that a significant number of options are rendered without crashing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested  
  Focus management is thoroughly evaluated via tests that trigger onFocus and onBlur events, check focus after menu interactions, and verify aria-activedescendant updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering  
  The tests explicitly check that the placeholder is displayed when no value is selected, and the proper value is shown both in single and multi-select modes as well as through the rendered hidden inputs.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations  
  Although there is a test for custom getOptionLabel and getOptionValue, there is no specific test for a custom formatOptionLabel implementation.  
  Explanation: The test suite does not include any scenarios that verify the behavior of a custom formatOptionLabel, which could be important for ensuring that option labels are formatted as intended when overridden.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)  
  The tests consistently verify that all key callbacks (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose) are called with the expected parameters during various interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)  
  There are tests that check for the presence and correct behavior of the dropdown indicator, clear indicator, and loading indicator under various props and interaction scenarios.
