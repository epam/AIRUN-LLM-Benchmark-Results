# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)
  
  The tests clearly use Jasmine as the testing framework with Karma as the test runner. This is evident from the use of Jasmine-specific functions like `describe()`, `it()`, `beforeEach()`, `jasmine.createSpy()`, and `expect()`. The answer also mentions setting up Karma in the configuration section.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints
  
  The tests properly mock `$resource` and handle REST API endpoints throughout the test suite. In the `REST` factory test, there's a sophisticated mock of `$resource` using a spy that returns a dummy resource object with methods like `query`, `get`, `save`, etc. In controller tests, the REST API endpoints are mocked with spies that return promises created with `$q.defer()`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation
  
  The tests consistently use `beforeEach()` hooks to set up the testing environment before each test, such as loading modules, creating mock objects, injecting dependencies, and initializing the controller. `afterEach()` hooks are also used when necessary, such as uninstalling the Jasmine clock after time-sensitive tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls
  
  All HTTP requests are properly mocked using spies on the REST service methods. For example, `mockREST.content.save.and.returnValue({ $promise: deferredContentSave.promise })`. No real API calls are made in these tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection
  
  The tests properly use AngularJS dependency injection. Dependencies are injected using the `inject()` function provided by `angular-mocks`. For controllers, the `$controller` service is used with a dependency object to inject both real and mock dependencies.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations
  
  The tests handle promises and asynchronous operations properly by:
  1. Creating deferred objects with `$q.defer()`
  2. Returning the promises from mocked functions
  3. Resolving/rejecting promises during tests
  4. Calling `$rootScope.$digest()` to process the Angular digest cycle after promise resolution/rejection
  
  This approach is used consistently throughout the codebase for testing asynchronous operations like REST API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies
  
  The tests make extensive and proper use of spies and mocks. Various approaches are used:
  - Jasmine spies: `jasmine.createSpy()`, `spyOn()`
  - Mock objects with spy methods: `mockREST`, `mockLocation`, etc.
  - Spy on real objects: `spyOn(localStorage, 'getItem')`
  - Mock implementations: `.and.callFake()`, `.and.returnValue()`

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization
  
  The tests are clearly organized using nested `describe()` blocks for logical grouping and `it()` blocks for individual test cases. Each test uses descriptive names that explain what's being tested. For example:
  
  ```javascript
  describe('Controller: pageCtrl', function () {
    // ...
    describe('Method: savePage', function () {
      // ...
      describe('New Page (/new)', function() {
        it('should call REST.content.save with correct data', function() {
          // ...
        });
        // more tests...
      });
    });
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls
  
  The tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls. For example, in the `savePage` method tests, there are tests for what happens when the content save succeeds and when it fails:
  
  ```javascript
  it('should show error notification if content save fails', function() {
    $scope.savePage();
    deferredContentSave.reject();
    $rootScope.$digest();
    expect(mockTranslate).toHaveBeenCalledWith('page_error_saving');
    // ...
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate
  
  Tests simulate user interactions by directly calling controller methods that would be triggered by user actions. For example, `$scope.savePage()`, `$scope.titleChange()`, `$scope.deletePage()`, and `$scope.selectSuggestion('completeTag')` all represent functions that would be called in response to user interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage
  
  The tests properly clean up after execution using `afterEach()` hooks where necessary. The most notable example is the use of `jasmine.clock().uninstall()` after tests that use `jasmine.clock().install()` to control time. Additionally, mocks and spies are re-initialized in `beforeEach()` blocks to prevent state leakage between tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested
  
  All test cases use clear, descriptive names that explain what's being tested. For example:
  - `'should initialize $scope.page with values from Page factory'`
  - `'should update Page.url with the scope value'`
  - `'should set autoURL to true if page url is empty'`
  - `'should redirect and notify after revision save succeeds (no extras)'`
  
  These names clearly indicate the expected behavior being tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible
  
  While some tests necessarily verify implementation details (like checking that specific API calls are made with correct parameters), many tests focus on validating function outputs and side effects:
  
  - Checking that properties are updated correctly: `expect($scope.page.title).toBe('Local Save Title')`
  - Verifying UI state changes: `expect($scope.newerVersion).toBe(false)`
  - Confirming user-facing actions occur: `expect($rootScope.$broadcast).toHaveBeenCalledWith('notify', { message: 'page_created' })`
  - Checking navigation: `expect(mockLocation.path).toHaveBeenCalledWith('test-url')`
