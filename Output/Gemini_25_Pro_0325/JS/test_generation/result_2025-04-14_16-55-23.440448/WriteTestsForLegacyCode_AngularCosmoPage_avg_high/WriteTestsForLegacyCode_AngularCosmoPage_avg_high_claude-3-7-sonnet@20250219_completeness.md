# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources
  
  The tests for the REST factory are comprehensive and validate all 17 defined resources including blocks, blocksRequirements, comments, content, contentExtras, contentRevisions, contentRevisionsExtras, contentTags, files, filesTags, menus, modules, sitemaps, themes, settings, and users. Each resource is tested with specific assertions about its URL, parameters, and actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly
  
  The `page.spec.js` file contains a dedicated test suite that verifies all properties of the Page factory are initialized with their default values, including id, title, description, header, subheader, body, url, type, published, published_date, themePages, timestamp, extras, and misc properties.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly
  
  The `users.spec.js` file contains tests that verify all properties of the Users factory initialize correctly, including id, username, name, bio, email, facebook, twitter, photo, and role.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods
  
  The `pageCtrl.spec.js` file contains comprehensive tests for all public methods of the controller, including titleChange, descriptionChange, urlChange, updatePageType, savePage, saveLocal, deletePage, localVersion, deleteNewerVersion, autocompleteTags, and selectSuggestion.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller
  
  The tests thoroughly verify the controller's initialization logic, including how it sets up the page properties from the Page factory, handles scheduleDate initialization based on various conditions, sets page type correctly, and checks localStorage for newer versions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation
  
  The tests for the titleChange function explicitly verify that URLs are auto-generated from the title when autoURL is true, ensuring special characters are handled appropriately. Tests also verify that URLs are not changed when autoURL is false, and that autoURL is set appropriately based on the current URL state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction
  
  The tests for the saveLocal function verify that it properly saves relevant page properties to localStorage using the current route parameter URL as a prefix, properly updating the Page factory and storing the correct values in localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality
  
  The tests for autocompleteTags verify it calls REST.contentTags.query with the correct parameters, sets suggestions properly on successful query, clears suggestions on failed query, and handles empty tag cases appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)
  
  The tests for savePage comprehensively cover all branches including new page creation, page updates, duplication checks, handling extras, error cases, and the complex promise chains involved in saving a page completely.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types
  
  The tests explicitly verify behavior with edge cases including empty URLs, URLs set to "new", empty page types, title fallback when empty, and handling of localStorage data.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly
  
  The tests for deletePage verify it calls all required DELETE endpoints (content, contentRevisions, contentRevisionsExtras, contentExtras, contentTags), handles notification broadcasting, and redirects to "/new" after deletion.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions
  
  The tests thoroughly validate the newerVersion flag setting, localVersion restoration, and deleteNewerVersion functionality, ensuring all localStorage interactions are properly tested.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components
  
  The tests appear comprehensive enough to achieve high code coverage. They cover initialization, all major code paths, edge cases, successful and error responses from API calls, and the complex asynchronous operations. However, without an actual coverage report, it's difficult to guarantee the exact percentage, which is why I'm assigning 90% confidence.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling
  
  The tests verify event broadcasting (notify, contentGet, settingsGet) and event handling (responding to the contentGet event) throughout the controller functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality
  
  The tests thoroughly cover date handling and scheduling functionality, including different publish states (draft, publish now, schedule), handling of past vs. future scheduled dates, and the proper calculation of timestamps.
