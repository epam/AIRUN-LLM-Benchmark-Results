# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)  
  The tests are written using Jasmine with Karma in mind and rely on angular-mocks, confirming that a modern framework is in use.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints  
  The tests for the REST factory replace the actual $resource with spies that check the calls and return dummy resources, ensuring REST API endpoints are handled without issuing real HTTP requests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation  
  The test files consistently use beforeEach to set up module, dependency injections, and even install/uninstall Jasmine clock where needed, ensuring proper isolation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls  
  The tests use angular-mocks and mocked implementations (spies, deferred promises) so that no actual HTTP requests are made during testing.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection  
  All needed dependencies (e.g., $controller, $rootScope, $q, REST, Page, Users, $translate) are injected via AngularJS's dependency injection, ensuring tests are not dependent on global state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations  
  The tests correctly create deferred objects with $q, resolve or reject them as needed, and call $rootScope.$digest() to simulate asynchronous behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies  
  There is extensive use of jasmine.createSpy, spies on localStorage methods, and replacement of services such as $resource and $translate, confirming proper mocking.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization  
  The test suite is well-organized with nested describe blocks and it statements that clearly state the behavior being tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls  
  The tests simulate both resolution and rejection of promises, checking for success notifications as well as error notifications.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate  
  Methods such as titleChange, urlChange, and selectSuggestion are invoked to simulate interactions, and events (e.g., $rootScope.$broadcast) are tested accordingly.

- **Pass** (95%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage  
  While the tests clean up asynchronous state—especially with the proper installation and uninstallation of the Jasmine clock—and rely on beforeEach to set state for each test, a few global spies (e.g., on localStorage) are set on the global object. This approach appears controlled by the test environment; however, there is a slight dependency on the global mock state which makes me a bit less than 100% confident.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested  
  The test descriptions and it blocks are written with clarity, explicitly stating what behavior or functionality is expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible  
  The tests focus on outcomes such as broadcasted events, REST calls with correct parameters, and changes to scope properties. Although some tests check internal calls (spies), they primarily validate the externally visible behavior.
