# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering  
  The app.test.tsx file contains tests that check for the correct rendering of the TodoApp component (e.g., verifying the presence of the input, list items, and footer).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos  
  The tests in app.test.tsx check that new todos are added correctly when text is entered and the Enter key is pressed, as well as verifying that empty or whitespace input does not add a new todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos  
  The app.test.tsx file includes tests that simulate clicking the "toggle-all" checkbox and verify that the model’s toggleAll method is called with the correct arguments, reflecting the toggled state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos  
  Tests in app.test.tsx simulate route changes (e.g., '/active' and '/completed') and verify that filtering works as expected by checking for the presence or absence of todos based on their completion state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The app.test.tsx file contains tests that simulate clicking the "Clear completed" button and checks that the model’s clearCompleted method is invoked appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering  
  The todoItem.test.tsx file verifies that the TodoItem component renders correctly in both view and completed states.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos  
  The tests in todoItem.test.tsx call the onToggle, onDestroy, and onEdit handlers, ensuring that the corresponding actions (toggle, destroy, edit) are performed correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events  
  The file contains tests that simulate key events (Enter and Escape) in edit mode and verify that onSave, onDestroy, or onCancel are called as appropriate.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts  
  The footer.test.tsx file includes tests that validate rendering of singular and plural item counts as well as the correct textual content based on the count.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation  
  The tests verify that the filter links ("All", "Active", "Completed") are rendered and that the appropriate filter link receives the "selected" class based on the current view.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The footer tests check for the presence or absence of the "Clear completed" button depending on the completed count and that clicking it invokes the onClearCompleted handler.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos  
  The todoModel.test.ts file thoroughly tests methods like addTodo, toggle, save, and destroy, ensuring that todos are updated correctly and that changes are communicated.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions  
  Tests in todoModel.test.ts ensure that subscribers are registered via subscribe and that the inform method calls these subscribers accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The file includes tests that validate clearCompleted, ensuring that it both removes completed todos and calls inform to update subscribers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation  
  The utils.test.ts file contains tests verifying that uuid generates a string of correct length and format and that multiple calls produce unique IDs.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality  
  The tests confirm that pluralize returns the correct singular or plural form based on the provided count.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations  
  The utils.test.ts file includes tests for the store function in various scenarios: empty localStorage, data retrieval, invalid JSON, and storing new data.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function  
  The tests for extend check that multiple objects are merged correctly, handling empty objects and ensuring a new object is returned.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx  
  Most test files for React components follow the .test.tsx convention (e.g., app.test.tsx, footer.test.tsx, todoItem.test.tsx). For non-UI modules like utils and todoModel, the tests are named with .test.ts. This is a common practice and generally acceptable; however, if the strict naming convention was to use .test.tsx for all tests, then these would need to be renamed. Due to the widespread industry practice of using .test.ts for non-JSX tests, we consider this acceptable.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data  
  The test files define sample todo data (e.g., mockTodos, initialTodos) that are used as fixtures for validating behavior in multiple tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented  
  The app.test.tsx file mocks the Router and verifies routing behaviors by simulating route changes using the mocked router callbacks.
