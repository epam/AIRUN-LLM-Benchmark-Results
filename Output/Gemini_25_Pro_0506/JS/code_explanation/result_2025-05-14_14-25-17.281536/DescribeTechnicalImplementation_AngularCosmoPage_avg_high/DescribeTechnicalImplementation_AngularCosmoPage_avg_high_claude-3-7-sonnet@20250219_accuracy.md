# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies Angular.js as the framework used

    The documentation clearly identifies AngularJS (Angular 1.x) as the framework used throughout the documentation. In the first line of the answer, it states "this is a classic AngularJS (Angular 1.x) setup" and consistently refers to AngularJS concepts and patterns throughout.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all factories (REST, Page, Users) are accurately documented with their purposes

    All three factories are thoroughly documented with their purposes clearly explained:
    - The REST factory is described as "a centralized factory for defining and accessing RESTful API endpoints"
    - The Page factory is explained as a "global singleton service to store and share the state of the page currently being created or edited"
    - The Users factory is described as a "global singleton service to store and share data about the currently authenticated user"

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of the Page controller and its functionality is technically accurate

    The documentation provides a detailed and technically accurate description of the pageCtrl controller. It correctly explains its functionality including initialization, local storage draft recovery, page operations (delete, save, duplicate), form field interactions, tag autocomplete, and event handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the RESTful API endpoints are correctly documented

    The documentation accurately describes the REST factory's implementation, including how it uses $resource to communicate with backend endpoints such as "api/blocks/:blockID", "api/content/:contentID", and how it provides methods for CRUD operations (query(), get(), save(), delete()). It also correctly explains custom actions like update with the PUT method.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of Angular module dependencies ($resource, $location, etc.) is correct

    The documentation correctly lists and explains the Angular dependencies injected into the pageCtrl controller, including $scope, REST, $location, Page, $rootScope, $routeParams, $upload, Users, and $translate. Each dependency's purpose is accurately described.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the page management features (creating, editing, deleting) are accurately described

    The documentation accurately describes the page management features:
    - Creating new pages through the savePage() method
    - Editing existing pages with proper state management
    - Deleting pages through the deletePage() method which also handles related content like revisions and tags
    - Additional features like duplicating pages

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately explains how the local storage mechanism works

    The documentation correctly explains the local storage draft recovery mechanism. It details how the controller checks localStorage for newer unsaved versions, how the newerVersion flag controls the recovery UI visibility, and the functions localVersion() and deleteNewerVersion() that handle restoration and deletion of local drafts.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of form validation logic is technically accurate

    The documentation accurately describes the form validation logic implemented in the savePage() method, including validation for unique URLs for duplicates, page type selection, and non-empty URL requirements.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of publish/schedule date handling is correct

    The documentation correctly explains how the publish/schedule date handling works, including how the controller determines scheduleDate and publish status based on user input, and how the UI provides radio buttons for publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) with a datetime-local input appearing when "schedule" is selected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the tag management and autocomplete feature explanation is technically accurate

    The documentation accurately explains the tag management and autocomplete functionality, including the autocompleteTags() method that queries REST.contentTags for suggestions, the selectSuggestion() method that adds selected suggestions to page.tags, and how the UI displays and handles tag interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the relationship between controllers, factories, and templates is accurately explained

    The documentation clearly explains how the components work together: the REST factory for API communication, the Page factory for state management, the pageCtrl controller for logic orchestration, and how these interact with the page.html template. It correctly describes the data flow and event handling between these components.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation correctly identifies and explains the purpose of broadcast events

    The documentation accurately identifies and explains broadcast events including 'contentGet' for refreshing page data, 'settingsGet', and the notification broadcasts through $rootScope.$broadcast('notify', ...). It explains their purpose in communication between components.
