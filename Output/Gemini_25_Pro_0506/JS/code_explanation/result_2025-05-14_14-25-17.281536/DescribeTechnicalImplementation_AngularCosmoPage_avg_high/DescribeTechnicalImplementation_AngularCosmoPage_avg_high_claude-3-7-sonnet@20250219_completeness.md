    - Page creation and editing
    - Local storage draft recovery
    - Auto-URL generation
    - Tag management with autocomplete
    - Publishing status controls (publish, draft, schedule)
    - Page type selection
    - Page deletion and duplication
    - Form field interactions and data synchronization
    - Internationalization support

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all form inputs and their behavior are documented

    Section 2.5 provides detailed documentation of all form inputs in the page editor:
    - Type selection dropdown

    - Description textarea with character count
    - Tags input with autocomplete
    - URL input with auto-generation option
    - Publish status radio buttons
    - Schedule date input for scheduled publishing

    The behavior of each field, including events and data binding, is thoroughly documented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page versioning and revision system

    The documentation explains the page versioning and revision system in multiple sections:
    - Section 2.4 details the local storage draft recovery system that checks for newer, unsaved versions of the page
    - It explains the functions `$scope.newerVersion`, `$scope.localVersion()`, and `$scope.deleteNewerVersion()`
    - Section 2.4 also documents how revisions are saved as part of the page saving workflow via `saveRevisionPromise`
    - Section 4 (Usage Documentation) includes "Draft Recovery" as a common use case and explains how it works

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation covers the tag system and autocomplete functionality

    The tag system and autocomplete functionality are thoroughly documented:
    - Section 2.4 includes a dedicated "Tag Autocomplete" subsection explaining `$scope.autocompleteTags()` and `$scope.selectSuggestion()`
    - Section 2.5 details the HTML implementation of the tags input with the ng-list directive and tag suggestions UI
    - Section 3.4 lists the relevant methods and properties exposed to the view for tag functionality

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes explanation of error handling and user notifications

    Error handling and notifications are documented:
    - Section 2.4 explains how the controller broadcasts notifications via `$rootScope.$broadcast('notify', ...)` for success or error messages
    - The documentation notes the use of `$translate` for internationalization of these messages
    - Section 6 mentions error handling as an area for maintenance, noting "While notifications are broadcast, ensure comprehensive error handling for all API calls, providing clear feedback to the user."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page publishing workflow including scheduling

    The documentation clearly explains the publishing workflow:
    - Section 2.5 documents the publish status controls (publish, draft, schedule) in the UI
    - Section 2.4 explains how `$scope.savePage()` determines `scheduleDate` and `publish` status based on user input
    - Section 3.4 lists the relevant `$scope` properties like `page.publish` and `page.scheduleDate`
    - The documentation describes how the controller handles both immediate publishing and scheduled publishing options

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation details how content extras and additional metadata are managed

    Content extras and metadata management is documented:
    - Section 2.4 explains how the `savePage()` function extracts featured image URL from `Page.extras.featured`
    - It also documents the `saveExtrasPromise` step in the page saving workflow
    - Section 3.2 lists `extras` as a property of the Page Factory with description "Container for custom fields/data"
    - The documentation explains that extras are saved after the main content and tags during the sequential saving process

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation explains how the UI interacts with the backend APIs

    The documentation thoroughly explains backend API interactions:
    - Section 2.1 details the REST Factory that handles all API communications
    - Section 2.4 explains how specific API endpoints are called for various operations:
      - `REST.content.delete` for page deletion
      - `REST.content.save()` for new pages
      - `REST.content.update()` for existing pages
      - `REST.contentTags` for tag suggestions
    - The documentation explains the promise chain used in `savePage()` to orchestrate sequential API calls

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes sample usage examples or patterns

    Sample usage examples are provided in Section 4 (Usage Documentation):
    - A sample route configuration using ngRoute is included
    - Three common use cases are described in detail:
      1. Creating a New Page
      2. Editing an Existing Page
      3. Draft Recovery
    - Each use case includes a step-by-step explanation of the user flow and the underlying code execution

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains all significant event broadcasting and inter-component communication

    The documentation covers event broadcasting and inter-component communication:
    - Section 2.4 explains how the controller listens for `$rootScope.$on('contentGet', ...)` to refresh its local page data
    - It documents how the controller broadcasts notifications using `$rootScope.$broadcast('notify', ...)`
    - The documentation explains how `updatePage()` is triggered on the `contentGet` event
    - It describes how `$scope.updatePageType()` broadcasts `settingsGet`
    - Section 2.4 also explains how the controller syncs between the local `$scope.page` and the global `Page` factory
