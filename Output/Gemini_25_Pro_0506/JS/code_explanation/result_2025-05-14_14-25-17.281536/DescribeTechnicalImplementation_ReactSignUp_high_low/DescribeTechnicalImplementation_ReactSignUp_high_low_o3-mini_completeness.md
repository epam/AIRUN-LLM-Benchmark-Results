- **Pass** (100%): Verify that both synchronous and asynchronous validation processes are fully documented  
  The documentation clearly describes the synchronous validation rules (e.g., character limits, required fields) as well as the asynchronous validation process (with API calls for name and email uniqueness), including how errors are handled.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation explains the form submission process and error handling  
  It covers the submission process by describing how redux-form handles the form submission, the role of handleSubmit, and the way errors are captured and displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure usage examples demonstrate proper component integration and prop configurations  
  Usage examples are given for integrating the Signup component into a router setup as well as for using the reduxForm configuration, clearly showing how props are wired.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that accessibility features including keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility are documented

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation includes details on validation rules and constraints for all form fields  
  Detailed validation constraints for the name, email, and password fields are provided, outlining both the requirements and the corresponding error messages.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation concludes with a summary highlighting key benefits, accessibility compliance, and performance considerations  
  A concluding section summarizes the key benefits, addresses accessibility practices, and discusses performance considerations for both components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the component's internal structure and state management approach are fully documented  
  The internal architecture, state management via redux-form, lifecycle methods, and event handling are all detailed clearly in the documentation.
