# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies Angular.js as the framework used
  
  The documentation correctly identifies that this is an AngularJS (Angular 1.x) implementation. It refers to AngularJS throughout the document, including proper references to AngularJS-specific concepts like factories, controllers, $scope, $resource, and other AngularJS services.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all factories (REST, Page, Users) are accurately documented with their purposes
  
  The documentation thoroughly describes all three factories:
  - REST factory is correctly described as centralizing RESTful API endpoint definitions
  - Page factory is accurately described as a global in-memory store for the current page properties
  - Users factory is correctly described as holding the currently logged-in user data

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of the Page controller and its functionality is technically accurate
  
  The documentation provides a detailed and technically accurate description of the pageCtrl controller, including its initialization, functions for handling local versions, page deletion, data synchronization, form field interactions, tag autocomplete, and page saving functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the RESTful API endpoints are correctly documented
  
  The documentation includes a comprehensive table of all API endpoints from the REST factory, including the resource keys, endpoint templates, parameters, and custom methods (like update with PUT).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of Angular module dependencies ($resource, $location, etc.) is correct
  
  The document correctly identifies and explains all the injected dependencies in the pageCtrl controller, including $scope, REST, $location, Page, $rootScope, $routeParams, $upload, Users, and $translate, along with their purposes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the page management features (creating, editing, deleting) are accurately described
  
  The document provides a detailed and accurate description of the page CRUD operations, particularly in the pageCtrl Controller section where it describes page creation, editing, duplication, and deletion processes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately explains how the local storage mechanism works
  
  The documentation correctly explains the localStorage mechanism for saving drafts, including how data is prefixed with the page URL, how newer versions are detected, and the functions to restore or delete local versions.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of form validation logic is technically accurate
  
  The documentation accurately describes the validation logic in the savePage function, including checks for duplicate URLs, ensuring a page type is selected, verifying the URL is not empty or "new", and using fallbacks for empty titles.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of publish/schedule date handling is correct
  
  The document accurately describes how the publishing logic determines the scheduleDate based on the publish status ('Y', 'N', 'schedule') and correctly notes that scheduling for a past date sets the publish status to 'Y'.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the tag management and autocomplete feature explanation is technically accurate
  
  The documentation correctly explains the tag autocomplete functionality, including how the autocompleteTags function queries for suggestions and how selectSuggestion appends selected suggestions to the tags list.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the relationship between controllers, factories, and templates is accurately explained
  
  The documentation clearly explains how the components work together - the Page and Users factories provide data storage, the REST factory handles API communication, and the pageCtrl controller manages the binding between the model and the page.html view.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation correctly identifies and explains the purpose of broadcast events
  
  The documentation accurately identifies and explains the broadcast events, including 'contentGet' for refreshing the scope, 'settingsGet', and 'notify' for user feedback messages via $rootScope.$broadcast.
