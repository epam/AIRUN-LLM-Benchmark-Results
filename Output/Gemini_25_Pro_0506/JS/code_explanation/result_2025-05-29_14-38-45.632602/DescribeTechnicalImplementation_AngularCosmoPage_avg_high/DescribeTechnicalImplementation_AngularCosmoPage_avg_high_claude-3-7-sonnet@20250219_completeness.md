    - It explains both `$scope.autocompleteTags()` and `$scope.selectSuggestion()` functions
    - The API interactions for tags are covered in the REST factory documentation
    - The page saving section explains how tags are saved, deleted, and updated

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes explanation of error handling and user notifications

    The documentation addresses error handling and user notifications:
    - User notifications are explained in Section 2D, subsection 7 "Page Saving" with the mention of `$rootScope.$broadcast('notify', ...)` with messages from `$translate` service
    - The "Newer Version" notification bar is described in the local version management section
    - The validation logic in the savePage function is documented, showing how errors are prevented
    - The document mentions error callbacks for API requests in the "Best Practices for Implementation" section

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page publishing workflow including scheduling

    The page publishing workflow is clearly explained:
    - Section 2D, subsection 7 "Page Saving" details the publishing logic
    - It explains how `scheduleDate` is determined based on `$scope.page.publish` status ('Y', 'N', 'schedule')
    - The logic for handling scheduled dates in the past is covered
    - The interface specifications section shows the data structure for publication status

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation details how content extras and additional metadata are managed

    The management of content extras and additional metadata is well documented:
    - The Page factory interface specifications show the `extras` property
    - Section 2D, subsection 7 "Page Saving" explains how extras are saved using `REST.contentExtras.save` and `REST.contentRevisionsExtras.save`
    - The document explains the asynchronous saving of multiple extras
    - The REST factory documentation shows the API endpoints for content extras

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation explains how the UI interacts with the backend APIs

    The documentation thoroughly explains UI-backend API interactions:
    - The REST factory section details all API endpoints used
    - The Page Saving section provides a detailed explanation of the API call flow for create/duplicate and update operations
    - The documentation shows how form inputs trigger controller functions that interact with the API
    - The deletion workflow clearly shows the sequence of API calls needed

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes sample usage examples or patterns

    Section 4 "Usage Documentation" provides comprehensive sample usage examples for:
    - REST Factory: Shows how to get, save, and update content
