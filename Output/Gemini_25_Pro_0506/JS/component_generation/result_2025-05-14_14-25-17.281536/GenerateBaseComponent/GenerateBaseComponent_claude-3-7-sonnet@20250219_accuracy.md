- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
  
  The code includes proper TypeScript interfaces (`OptionType`, `SearchableSelectProps`), type annotations for all functions, parameters, and state variables, and proper generic type usage like in `useOnClickOutside<T extends HTMLElement>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility
  
  The component uses multiple `useState` hooks appropriately for managing dropdown state (`isOpen`), search term (`searchTerm`), and focused option index (`focusedOptionIndex`).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions
  
  The component uses `useRef` for DOM elements correctly, employs the custom `useOnClickOutside` hook properly, and follows best practices for imperative DOM interactions like `scrollIntoView`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques
  
  Focus management is well-implemented with focus moving to the search input when the dropdown opens and returning to the trigger button when it closes, along with proper tracking of focused options.
