# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element
  
  The code includes a button that serves as the trigger for the dropdown and a div with class `searchable-select-dropdown` that contains the dropdown content.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown
  
  The dropdown includes an input element with the class `searchable-select-search-input` and has functionality to filter options based on the search term.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown
  
  The component tracks the selected value through the `value` prop and updates it via the `onChange` callback when an item is selected.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys
  
  The component includes handlers for keyboard events that process the ArrowDown and ArrowUp keys to navigate through the options, updating the `focusedOptionIndex` state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key
  
  The `handleSearchInputKeyDown` function handles the Enter key press to select the currently focused option with `handleOptionSelect(filteredOptions[focusedOptionIndex])`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused
  
  The `handleTriggerKeyDown` function contains logic to toggle the dropdown when Enter or Space key is pressed on the trigger button.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes
  
  In the `closeDropdown` function, there's a line `triggerRef.current?.focus();` which returns focus to the trigger button when the dropdown closes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click
  
  The `handleOptionSelect` function is called when an option is clicked, and it calls `closeDropdown()` which closes the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard
  
  When an item is selected via Enter key (in `handleSearchInputKeyDown`), it calls the same `handleOptionSelect` function which closes the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed
  
  Both keyboard handlers (`handleTriggerKeyDown` and `handleSearchInputKeyDown`) include logic to close the dropdown when the Escape key is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component
  
  The component uses a custom hook `useOnClickOutside` that attaches event listeners to detect clicks outside the container and closes the dropdown when detected.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused
  
  The `handleTriggerKeyDown` function contains logic to open the dropdown when Enter or Space key is pressed on the trigger button.
