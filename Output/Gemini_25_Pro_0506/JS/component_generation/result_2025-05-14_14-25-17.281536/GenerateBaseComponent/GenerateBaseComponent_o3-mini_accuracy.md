# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  The code imports and uses React 18.x features such as useId, which confirms the component is built on React 18.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  The implementation utilizes TypeScript interfaces (e.g., OptionType, SearchableSelectProps) and TypeScript syntax throughout the component code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  An "index.css" file is provided with the necessary CSS rules for the componentâ€™s styling.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  The code is clean, well-structured, and free of any TODO comments or placeholder code.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  State management using useState for "isOpen", "searchTerm", and "focusedOptionIndex" is appropriately handled along with effects to update UI state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  The component accepts several props (id, options, value, onChange, placeholder, label, disabled, notFoundContent) making it highly customizable and reusable.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  The code includes keyboard handling for trigger, search input navigation (Arrow keys, Enter, Escape) ensuring robust keyboard accessibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  It leverages useRef for DOM interactions and includes a custom hook (useOnClickOutside) for handling outside clicks, following best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  Focus management is handled correctly by focusing the search input upon dropdown open and returning focus to the trigger button on close.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  The component makes appropriate use of ARIA attributes (aria-haspopup, aria-expanded, aria-controls, aria-label, role="listbox", role="option", aria-selected, aria-activedescendant, etc.) to enhance accessibility.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  The code appears free of potential issues that would lead to console errors or warnings. However, without executing the component, there is a minor uncertainty, albeit unlikely, about runtime warnings.  
  Explanation: Since static code review cannot fully replicate runtime conditions, there is a 90% confidence level.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  The component makes good use of useMemo and useCallback to minimize unnecessary re-renders, optimizing performance.
