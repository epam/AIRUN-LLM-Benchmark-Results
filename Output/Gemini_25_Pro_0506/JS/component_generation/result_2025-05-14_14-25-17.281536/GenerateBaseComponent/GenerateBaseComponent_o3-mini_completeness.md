- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component renders a button that conditionally displays a dropdown container when the isOpen state is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  The dropdown includes an input element (with type="text" and appropriate ARIA attributes) for searching options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The code handles selection via the handleOptionSelect callback, ensuring that only one item is selected at a time.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The component provides keydown event handling for ArrowDown and ArrowUp both on the trigger button and the search input to navigate through options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  The component listens for the Enter key within the search input and trigger button to select an option, calling handleOptionSelect appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  Pressing Enter on the trigger toggles the isOpen state, thereby opening or closing the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  The closeDropdown function explicitly focuses the trigger element after closing the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  Clicking an option calls handleOptionSelect, which in turn calls closeDropdown, closing the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  The Enter key within the search input triggers item selection and closes the dropdown via closeDropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  Both the trigger button and the search input handle the Escape key to close the dropdown by calling closeDropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  The useOnClickOutside hook is used to detect external clicks and properly close the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused
