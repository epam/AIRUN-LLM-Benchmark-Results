# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The code fetches Star Wars characters from the SWAPI API in the `fetchCharacters` function and displays them in a list in the `App` component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The application properly manages loading state with a `loading` state variable and displays a "Loading characters..." message when data is being fetched.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The application maps through all fetched characters in the `characters` array and displays each one in a list item.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  The provided code doesn't implement any search functionality or user input fields, focusing solely on displaying the fetched data.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character is displayed in a list item with its name: `<li key={character.url} className="character-item">{character.name}</li>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The package.json file, folder structure, and configuration clearly indicate this is a Create React App project with TypeScript support.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The application correctly implements state management with useState hooks for loading, error, and characters data, and properly handles the transitions between these states.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each character list item has a unique key using the character's URL: `key={character.url}`, which provides a unique identifier for React's reconciliation algorithm.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  The application includes a conditional check for empty character lists and displays "No characters found." when the list is empty.
