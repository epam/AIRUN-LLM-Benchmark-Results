# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses React 18.x or newer by checking the package.json dependencies.  
  The package.json lists "react": "^18.2.0" and "react-dom": "^18.2.0", which confirms React 18.x is in use.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that TypeScript is properly implemented with appropriate type definitions for all components, props, and states.  
  The codebase defines types explicitly in src/types.ts, uses TypeScript in components (e.g., App.tsx), and applies type annotations with useState and function signatures.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Axios is used for API requests to fetch data from the Star Wars API endpoint.  
  Axios is imported and utilized in src/services/swapiService.ts to fetch data from the SWAPI endpoint.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles API errors gracefully with appropriate error states or messages.  
  The catch blocks in the API service and the error state management in App.tsx (displaying a friendly error message) demonstrate graceful handling of API errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the character data is fetched on component mount using the useEffect hook.  
  The App.tsx file includes a useEffect hook with an empty dependency array to fetch data once the component mounts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application properly manages component rendering optimization.  
  Given the applicationâ€™s scope, it leverages React hooks appropriately. Although advanced optimization (like memoizing components) is not used, the simple structure of the app does not require it.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows React best practices using hooks appropriately.  
  The use of useState and useEffect, as well as error and loading state management, aligns with common React best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't contain any TODO comments or unnecessary code.  
  The provided code is clean and does not include any extraneous TODO comments or leftover code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the codebase has minimal comments that only clarify complex logic when necessary.  
  Comments present in the code are used to explain key implementation details, such as error handling. They are minimal and relevant.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the API endpoint 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' is being called correctly.  
  In src/services/swapiService.ts, the endpoint is correctly constructed via axios.get using the base URL and the '/people/' path.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application renders without console errors or warnings.  
  Based on the provided code structure and proper error handling, there is no indication of any console errors or warnings during rendering.
