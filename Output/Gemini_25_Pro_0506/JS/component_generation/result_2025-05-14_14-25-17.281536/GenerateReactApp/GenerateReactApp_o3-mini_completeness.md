# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The App component fetches data from SWAPI and maps over the characters list to render each character in an unordered list.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  A loading indicator ("Loading characters...") is displayed while the API call is in progress.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  The application renders all characters by mapping over the fetched data, ensuring that each result is shown.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  The provided code solely focuses on fetching and displaying data without any search or input components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each list item displays the character's name as seen in the code (<li key={character.url}> {character.name} </li>).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The file structure and scripts (e.g., package.json, public/index.html, src/index.tsx) indicate that the project was scaffolded by Create React App.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The App component uses React's useState hook to manage 'loading', 'error', and 'characters' states, clearly handling different stages of the data fetching process.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  The code correctly uses the character's URL as a unique key for each list item in the rendered list of characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  There is an explicit check for an empty characters list, showing a message ("No characters found.") if there are no characters to display.
