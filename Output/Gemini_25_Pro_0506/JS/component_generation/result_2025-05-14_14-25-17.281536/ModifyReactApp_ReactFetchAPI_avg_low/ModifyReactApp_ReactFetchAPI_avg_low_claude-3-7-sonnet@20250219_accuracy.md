# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses
- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters
- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices
- **Pass** (90%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code

    The code contains one intentional console.error statement in the ErrorBoundary component for logging errors caught by the boundary, which is actually a best practice. There are no unused imports or commented-out code except for explanatory comments that show how to use the ErrorBoundary component, which are appropriate in this context.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns
