# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name
  
  The code clearly implements a search input field that takes user input with onChange handler to filter characters by name. The input is connected to the Star Wars API search endpoint.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests
  
  The application includes a loading state that displays "Loading..." text while API requests are in progress, shown in the renderContent function when loading is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query
  
  The useEffect hook triggers fetchCharacters on component mount with an empty debouncedSearchTerm, fulfilling the requirement for initial data loading.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type
  
  The implementation includes a debounce mechanism (useDebounce hook with 500ms delay) that triggers API calls as users type, ensuring search results update dynamically without overwhelming the API.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found
  
  The renderContent function includes specific handling for when characters.length is 0, displaying appropriate messages like "No characters found matching [searchTerm]".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design
  
  The component uses responsive design principles with maxWidth, width: 100% on inputs, and proper box-sizing to ensure it works across different screen sizes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response
  
  The code renders an unordered list (ul) with character names from the API response when results are available and loading is false.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed
  
  A comprehensive ErrorBoundary component is implemented as a class component with proper error catching, state management, and helpful error display for both production and development environments.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props
  
  The code includes well-defined TypeScript interfaces for Character, SwapiPeopleResponse, ErrorBoundaryProps, and ErrorBoundaryState, ensuring type safety throughout the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities
  
  The implementation maintains the core functionality of displaying Star Wars characters while adding search capabilities. The code structure preserves the original character listing functionality with the added search feature.
