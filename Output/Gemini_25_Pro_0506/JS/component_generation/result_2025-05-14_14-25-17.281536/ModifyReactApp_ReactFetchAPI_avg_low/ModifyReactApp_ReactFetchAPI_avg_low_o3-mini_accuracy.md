# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type  
  The answer includes an input element with an onChange handler that calls setSearchTerm, ensuring user input updates the component state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls  
  The provided code implements a useDebounce hook with a 500ms delay, which fits within the specified range.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured  
  The code uses axios with a GET request to the SWAPI endpoint and includes proper error handling, demonstrating correct configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses  
  TypeScript interfaces such as Character and SwapiPeopleResponse are defined and utilized, and the component and hook are properly typed.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters  
  The API endpoint is constructed as "https://swapi.dev/api/people/?search=" concatenated with the encoded search query, ensuring correct parameter inclusion.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate  
  The fetchCharacters function is wrapped in useCallback, which helps avoid unnecessary recreations and is appropriate for the given context.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback  
  A try-catch block is used during the API call, and any errors are caught, logged, and displayed to the user via the state and UI feedback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing  
  The debouncing mechanism ensures that API calls are made only after the user has stopped typing for 500ms.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices  
  The component uses useState and useEffect appropriately to manage state, and the code structure adheres to common React patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code  
  The code is clean, all imports and commented sections appear purposeful, and no obvious issues that would lead to console errors are present.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests  
  The loading state is set to true before making the API call and is reset in the finally block, ensuring the UI correctly reflects the request status.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns  
  The component is implemented as a functional component using hooks and FC notation, which aligns with React 18.x best practices.
