# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The code includes an input field with a placeholder ("Search Star Wars characters by name...") and an onChange handler that updates the search term state. This ensures that users can filter characters by name.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  The component renders a "Loading..." div when the loading state is true, indicating that the user is informed during API requests.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  The useEffect hook triggers the fetchCharacters function on mount with an empty debounced search term, which satisfies the requirement for initial data loading.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  As the user types, the search term state is updated and debounced before triggering the fetchCharacters call, ensuring that search results update dynamically.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  The code handles cases where no characters are returned: it displays either "No characters found matching ..." for a non-empty search or "No characters available." for an initial empty query with no results.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The inline styles (e.g., width: 100% for the input field and a max-width container) provide a basic responsive design for the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  When the API response returns character data, the code maps over the characters array to render a list of character names, confirming the display of search results.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  An ErrorBoundary component is provided, which can be used to wrap the CharacterList component. This component effectively catches and displays errors in its child components.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The code defines the necessary interfaces (e.g., Character and SwapiPeopleResponse) as well as appropriate TypeScript types for components and state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The integration of search functionality does not interfere with the original behavior. The application continues to perform the initial data fetch, display characters, and handle errors, while seamlessly adding the search capabilities.
