# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x
  
  The component imports React hooks that are compatible with React 18.x: `import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef, useMemo, useCallback } from 'react';`. The implementation uses modern React functional components with hooks which are fully supported in React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
  
  The code uses TypeScript throughout, with proper interfaces defined for `Option` and `SearchableSelectProps`. The component is defined with proper type annotations: `React.FC<SearchableSelectProps>`. Types are also correctly defined for refs, state variables, and function parameters.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling
  
  The component imports a CSS file (`import './index.css';`) and the implementation includes a comprehensive CSS file with all necessary styling for the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments
  
  The code is clean, well-structured, and has no TODO comments. It's organized logically with clear function and variable names, and is production-ready.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility
  
  The component correctly uses React's `useState` hook to manage state:
  - `isOpen` for dropdown visibility
  - `searchTerm` for the search input value
  - `highlightedIndex` for keyboard navigation
  
  It also properly manages the selected item through props (`value` and `onChange`).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props
  
  The component accepts customizable props including:
  - `id` for unique identification
  - `options` for the dropdown items
  - `value` for the selected option
  - `onChange` callback for selection changes
  - `placeholder` with a default value
  - `disabled` with a default value
  - `noOptionsMessage` with a default value

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection
  
  The component has thorough keyboard support with dedicated handlers:
  - `handleTriggerKeyDown` for the dropdown trigger button
  - `handleSearchInputKeyDown` for the search input
  
  These handlers properly implement navigation with arrow keys, selection with Enter, closing with Escape, and opening with Space/Enter.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions
  
  The component correctly uses `useRef` for DOM element references and follows best practices:
  - Refs are used appropriately for focus management
  - DOM interactions are handled through React's event system
  - `useCallback` is used for memoizing functions that interact with refs
  - Array of refs for option elements is managed efficiently

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques
  
  The component correctly manages focus:
  - Focus moves to the search input when the dropdown opens
  - Focus returns to the trigger button when the dropdown closes
  - Highlighted options are scrolled into view when navigating with keyboard
  - Focus is trapped within the component during dropdown interaction

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
  
  The component implements comprehensive ARIA attributes:
  - `aria-haspopup="listbox"` and `aria-expanded` on the trigger button
  - `aria-controls` to associate the trigger with the listbox
  - `role="listbox"` on the options list
  - `role="option"` and `aria-selected` on individual options
  - `aria-activedescendant` to indicate the currently highlighted option
  - `aria-label` and `aria-autocomplete` on the search input

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  The code appears to be free of any console errors or warnings. There are no apparent issues that would trigger React warnings like missing keys or improper use of hooks.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component
  
  The component efficiently prevents unnecessary re-renders by:
  - Using `useMemo` for `filteredOptions`
  - Using `useCallback` for `closeDropdown` and `handleSelectOption`
  - Properly managing dependencies in effect hooks
  - Only updating state when necessary
