# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  Although the code imports React and makes use of React hooks—which are available from React 16.8 onward—it does not explicitly specify the React version. In most modern projects, using React.FC and hooks would imply compatibility with React 18.x. However, since the version isn’t enforced in the code, I’m 90% confident that this meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  The code is contained in a TSX file and defines interfaces (e.g., Option and SearchableSelectProps) with clear type annotations throughout, satisfying TypeScript requirements.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  The component explicitly imports an "index.css" file and the CSS content is provided, meeting this criterion.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  The code is free of any TODO comments and shows production-ready practices with clean formatting and thoughtful structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  The component employs useState to manage the dropdown's open/closed state, the search term, and the highlighted index for options in a correct and straightforward manner.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  Customizable props such as id, options, value, onChange, placeholder, and others are provided, making the component reusable in different contexts.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  The code implements comprehensive keyboard handlers on both the trigger button and search input, supporting key navigation (ArrowUp, ArrowDown, Enter, Space, and Escape) as required.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  The use of useRef for tracking multiple DOM elements (container, trigger button, search input, listbox, and option elements) and the clean-up of event listeners demonstrates adherence to best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  The component shifts focus to the search input when the dropdown is open and returns focus to the trigger button upon closing, which satisfies proper focus management.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  ARIA attributes such as aria-haspopup, aria-expanded, aria-controls, role="listbox", role="option", aria-activedescendant, and aria-selected are appropriately employed to support accessibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  There are no obvious sources of console errors or warnings in the clean, well-structured code provided.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  The component utilizes useMemo and useCallback where appropriate to mitigate excessive re-renders. Although minor improvements might be possible depending on dynamic prop changes, the overall implementation appears optimized. Hence, I am 90% confident that unnecessary re-renders are minimized.
