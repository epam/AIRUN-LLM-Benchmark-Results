# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The code renders a button that displays the selected value or a placeholder and conditionally renders a dropdown container when the internal state "isOpen" is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  The dropdown markup includes an <input> element with appropriate attributes and a ref ("searchInputRef"), meaning the search input is part of the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The code defines a "handleSelectOption" function that accepts an option and calls "onChange(option)", clearly enabling single item selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The "handleSearchInputKeyDown" event handler responds to "ArrowUp" and "ArrowDown" keys, cycling through "highlightedIndex" values to navigate the options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  Within "handleSearchInputKeyDown", when the Enter key is pressed, if an option is highlighted, "handleSelectOption(filteredOptions[highlightedIndex])" is executed, which selects the item.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  The "handleTriggerKeyDown" of the trigger button listens for the "Enter" key and toggles "isOpen", thereby allowing the dropdown to open/close with Enter.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  In the "closeDropdown" function, after setting "isOpen" to false and resetting the search term, "triggerRef.current?.focus()" is explicitly called to bring focus back to the select element.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  The list items (<li>) have an "onClick" handler that calls "handleSelectOption", which in turn calls "closeDropdown"; thus, a mouse click on an option closes the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  The Enter key handler in the search input triggers item selection through "handleSelectOption", which then closes the dropdown; keyboard selection is properly handled.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  Both the trigger button and the search input handle the "Escape" key by calling "closeDropdown", ensuring that pressing Escape closes the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  A useEffect sets up a global "mousedown" listener that detects clicks outside the component (using the containerRef) and calls "closeDropdown" if the dropdown is open.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  The trigger button's keydown handler toggles the "isOpen" state on an "Enter" key press, ensuring that the dropdown opens when focused and Enter is pressed.
