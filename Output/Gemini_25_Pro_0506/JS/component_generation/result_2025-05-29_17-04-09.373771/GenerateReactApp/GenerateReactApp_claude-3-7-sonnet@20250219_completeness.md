# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The application fetches character data from the SWAPI endpoint 'https://swapi.dev/api/people/' and displays the names of the characters in a list. The `fetchCharacters` function in the `useEffect` hook makes an API call and sets the character data to the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The application uses a loading state which is set to true initially and when the API call starts. During loading, it renders a loading message: `<p className="loading-indicator">Loading characters...</p>`. This state is properly managed and set to false after the API call completes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The application maps through all characters in the `characters` state array and renders each one in a list item: `{characters.map((character) => (<li key={character.url} className="character-list-item">{character.name}</li>))}`. This ensures all fetched characters are displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  The code does not contain any search functionality, filters, or user input fields. The application simply fetches and displays the list of characters without any additional interactive features.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character is displayed in a list item showing the character's name: `{character.name}`. The styling applied to the list items through the CSS classes makes them visually distinct and well-formatted.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The application follows the standard Create React App structure with files like `package.json`, `public/index.html`, `src/index.tsx`, `src/App.tsx`, etc. The dependencies in package.json and the configuration are typical of a Create React App project.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The application properly manages three states:
  - `characters` state for storing the fetched character data
  - `loading` state to track when API calls are in progress
  - `error` state to capture and display any API errors
  
  These states are correctly used to control the rendering of different UI components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each character list item has a unique key attribute using the character's URL, which is guaranteed to be unique by SWAPI: `<li key={character.url} className="character-list-item">`. This satisfies React's requirement for unique keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  The application checks if the characters array is empty and displays an appropriate message: `<p>No characters found. The force may be weak with this API call.</p>`. This ensures users are informed when no data is available.
