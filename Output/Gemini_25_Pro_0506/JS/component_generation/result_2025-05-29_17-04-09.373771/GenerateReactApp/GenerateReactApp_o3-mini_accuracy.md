# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses React 18.x or newer.  
  The package.json specifies "react": "^18.2.0" and "react-dom": "^18.2.0", confirming the use of React 18.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that TypeScript is properly implemented with appropriate type definitions for all components, props, and states.  
  The code uses TypeScript (.tsx and .ts files) and defines interfaces (e.g., Character, SwapiResponse) to enforce type safety.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Axios is used for API requests to fetch data from the Star Wars API endpoint.  
  The application imports Axios and uses it in an async function to perform GET requests to the SWAPI.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles API errors gracefully with appropriate error states or messages.  
  The code includes a try-catch block within the useEffect hook. It captures Axios errors, sets an error message, and renders an error message in the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the character data is fetched on component mount using useEffect hook.  
  The useEffect hook is used with an empty dependency array to ensure that the API call is executed only on component mount.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application properly manages component rendering optimization.  
  The component uses conditional rendering based on the state (loading, error, characters) to avoid unnecessary renders. Although there are no advanced memoization techniques, the code structure is appropriate for this applicationâ€™s scope.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows React best practices using hooks appropriately.  
  The usage of useState, useEffect, and conditional rendering adheres to common React best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't contain any TODO comments or unnecessary code.  
  The code is clean, with comments only where necessary, and does not include any extraneous or placeholder TODO comments.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the codebase has minimal comments that only clarify complex logic when necessary.  
  The comments in the code are clear and provide context only where the logic might benefit from further explanation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the API endpoint 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' is being called correctly.  
  The API_URL constant is set to 'https://swapi.dev/api/people/' and is properly utilized in the Axios GET request.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application renders without console errors or warnings.  
  Based on the provided code structure and standard Create React App practices, there are no apparent pitfalls that would lead to console errors or warnings.
