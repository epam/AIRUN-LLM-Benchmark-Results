# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The application successfully fetches data from the SWAPI via Axios and renders the character list using the .map() function over the fetched results.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The code conditionally renders a loading indicator paragraph element (“Loading characters…”) when the loading state is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  The fetched character array is correctly mapped to a list of <li> elements, ensuring that all characters from the API response are rendered in the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  The provided code does not implement any search or input fields; it solely focuses on fetching and displaying the character list.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each list item displays the character’s name as obtained from the API response without additional unnecessary elements.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The file structure (with separate public and src directories) and usage of react-scripts confirm that the project is structured using Create React App.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  State is correctly managed via React’s useState hook for handling loading, error, and character data.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  The code uses the unique property “character.url” as the key for each list item, which satisfy React’s key requirements.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  The implementation includes a fallback UI message (“No characters found. The force may be weak with this API call.”) to handle cases when the data is empty.
