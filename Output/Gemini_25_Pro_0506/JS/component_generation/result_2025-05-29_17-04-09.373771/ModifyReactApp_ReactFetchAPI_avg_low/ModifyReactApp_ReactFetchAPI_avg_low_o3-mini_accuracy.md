# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type  
  The search input field is connected to the onChange handler (handleSearchChange) that updates the state variable (searchTerm) accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls  
  The custom hook useDebounce is implemented with a hardcoded 500ms delay, which meets the specified range.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured  
  The code uses axios.get with a well-formed generic type for the API response, ensuring type safety and correct configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses  
  Interfaces for Character and SwapiPeopleResponse are defined, and the component along with functions use appropriate TypeScript annotations.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters  
  The API URL is constructed using encodeURIComponent on currentSearchTerm and injected into the URL as a search query parameter, which meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate  
  The component uses useCallback for both fetchCharacters and handleSearchChange. Although the implementation does not use useMemo, the use of useCallback is appropriate for optimizing function references.  
  (Confidence is 90% because while useCallback is correctly implemented, the requirement mentions useMemo/useCallback, and no useMemo is necessary unless there is heavy computation.)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback  
  The code catches errors from axios and differentiates between Axios-specific errors and unexpected errors, setting a user-friendly error message accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing  
  Debouncing via useDebounce ensures that API fetches are delayed until the user stops typing for 500ms.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices  
  The state is managed using useState for searchTerm, characters, loading, and error with proper separation of concerns and clear updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code  
  The code does not contain any commented-out code or unused imports, and any console usage is intentional for error logging.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests  
  The component correctly sets the loading state to true before initiating the API call and resets it in the finally block after the API call completes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns  
  The component uses React.FC and hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback) and aligns well with modern React best practices, including accessibility considerations.
