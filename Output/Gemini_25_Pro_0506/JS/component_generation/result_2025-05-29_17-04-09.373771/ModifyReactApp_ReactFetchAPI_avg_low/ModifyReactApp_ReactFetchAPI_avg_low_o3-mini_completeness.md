# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The component renders an input element with an onChange handler that updates the search term, which is subsequently debounced to trigger the API call.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  A loading state is maintained and, when true, a "Loading characters..." message is displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  On mounting, the component calls the fetch function with an initially empty search term (via the debounced value), ensuring initial data loads.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  With the debounced search term and a useEffect dependency on it, the component refetches and updates the character list dynamically as the user types.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  The component conditionally renders a message when no characters are found for non-empty search terms, as well as a fallback message when the initial load returns an empty list.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  Inline styles (using width: 100%, maxWidth, and centered container) indicate a design that adapts to different screen sizes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  When characters are returned from the API (and given no error or loading state), the component correctly maps and displays the characters in a list.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  While the component properly handles API errors with try/catch and displays an error message, it does not incorporate a dedicated React Error Boundary for catching rendering errors. An Error Boundary component would enhance robustness by handling exceptions during rendering, lifecycle methods, and constructors in its child components.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The component defines clear TypeScript interfaces (e.g., Character, SwapiPeopleResponse) and uses generics with axios to ensure strong typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The solution preserves the original data-fetching behavior on mount (via an empty search query) while seamlessly integrating the new search functionality and optimizations.
