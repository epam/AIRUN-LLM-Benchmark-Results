# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document identifies the application as a Todo list management application  
  The document clearly states that it is a Todo Application and outlines its core CRUD features, which identifies it correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the component structure (TodoApp, TodoItem, TodoFooter)  
  The answer details the roles of TodoApp, TodoItem, TodoFooter, and even related components like TodoModel, demonstrating a clear understanding of their relationships.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of local storage for data persistence  
  The description highlights how TodoModel uses Utils.store() to persist data via localStorage, which aligns with the provided implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the state management approach using the TodoModel  
  The explanation details how TodoModel holds the canonical list of todos and uses subscription and inform patterns to manage and propagate state changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the routing mechanism for filtering todos  
  The answer explains the usage of a Router initialized in TodoApp.componentDidMount() and the hash-based routing (e.g., #/active, #/completed) used for filtering.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the event handling for user interactions  
  The document thoroughly explains event handling patterns for adding, editing, toggling, and deleting todos through appropriate user interactions and method calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of immutable data structures for state management  
  It correctly notes that immutable approaches (using methods like map and filter) are employed in the TodoModel, which is an important practice for React applications.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the performance optimization using shouldComponentUpdate  
  The answer details that TodoItem implements shouldComponentUpdate to prevent unnecessary re-renders, which is an effective performance optimization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of the Utils class for helper functions  
  The description covers various helper methods provided by the Utils class (uuid, pluralize, store, extend), confirming its correct identification.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the data flow between components  
  The provided data flow explanation shows how data moves from the TodoModel to TodoApp and then to child components, accurately reflecting the application's structure.
