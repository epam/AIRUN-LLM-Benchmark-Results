- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about filtering todos by status (all, active, completed)  
  Filtering is well documented with references to URL hash changes, the TodoFooter links (All, Active, Completed), and how the state nowShowing in TodoApp influences the filtering.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the user workflow for creating new todo items

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the editing functionality triggered by double-clicking  
  The document clearly specifies that double-clicking a todo item label triggers the editing mode, along with details on focus management and the submission or cancellation (ENTER_KEY, blur, ESCAPE_KEY) of the edit.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the clear completed functionality  
  Clear completed functionality is described within both the features and user interaction sections, including how the TodoFooter displays the "Clear completed" button when there are completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the toggle all functionality

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the persistent storage of todos  
  Persistent storage is clearly noted by referencing the TodoModelâ€™s use of Utils.store() and the reliance on localStorage for data persistence.

  Business objectives, including enhancing productivity, ease of use, and user focus through filtering and saving state across sessions, are clearly documented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes performance and scalability considerations  
  The report outlines performance optimizations such as shouldComponentUpdate, immutable data handling, and concerns about scalability with large numbers of todos and localStorage limits.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes technical constraints and limitations  
  Technical constraints such as client-side only operation, localStorage capacity, reliance on an external router, and no user authentication are thoroughly discussed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the pluralization of item/items text based on count
