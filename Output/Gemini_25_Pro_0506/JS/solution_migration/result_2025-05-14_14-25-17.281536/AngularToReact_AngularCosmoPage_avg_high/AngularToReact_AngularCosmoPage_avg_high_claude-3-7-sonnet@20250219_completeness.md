# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented

    The code thoroughly implements all page management functionality. The `handleSavePage` function handles both create and update operations with the `isDuplicate` parameter to distinguish duplications. The `handleDeletePage` function implements page deletion. All core CRUD operations are properly implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present

    Page type selection is implemented through a dropdown select element populated with `themePagesOptions`. The `onChange` handler for this element updates both the local form state and dispatches to the Redux store with `dispatch(setGlobalPageType(e.target.value))`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists

    URL auto-generation is implemented in the `handleInputChange` function. When the title field changes and `autoGenerateUrl` is true, the URL is automatically generated by transforming the title (lowercase, replacing spaces with hyphens, removing special characters). The `setAutoGenerateUrl` state is also properly managed to disable this feature after manual URL changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented

    Tag management with autocomplete suggestions is fully implemented. The code includes functionality to:
    - Input and track tags with the `currentTagInput` state
    - Add tags when a comma is typed
    - Fetch and display tag suggestions with `contentTagsApi.query`
    - Add tags from suggestions with `addTagFromSuggestion`
    - Remove tags with `removeTag`

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available

    All three publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are implemented with radio buttons and their associated handlers in the `handlePublishChange` function.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented

    Scheduled publishing is implemented with a conditional rendering of a datetime-local input when `formState.publish === 'schedule'`. The `handleSavePage` function properly handles the scheduled date logic, setting the appropriate `effectivePublishDate` and `finalPublishStatus` based on the selected publish option and schedule date.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present

    Local storage for draft versioning is fully implemented with:
    - Saving drafts to localStorage with `saveToLocalStorage` 
    - Checking for newer versions with the `useEffect` that sets `newerVersionExists`
    - Restoring local versions with `handleUseLocalVersion`
    - Discarding local versions with `handleDeleteNewerVersion`
    - UI for displaying when a newer version exists and options to use or discard it

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented

    A notification system is implemented using Redux. The code includes a `NotificationDisplay` component and the appropriate `dispatch(showNotification(...))` calls throughout the page editor for various success and error conditions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present

    Form validation for required fields is implemented in the `handleSavePage` function. It checks for missing page type and URL, showing appropriate error notifications before proceeding with the save operation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled

    The API endpoints are properly handled through structured service modules like `contentApi`, `contentExtrasApi`, `contentRevisionsApi`, `contentRevisionsExtrasApi`, and `contentTagsApi`. Each provides functions that match the original REST operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented

    Extras management is implemented in the `handleSavePage` function where extras from `globalPageData.extras` are saved to the API with proper promises for both content extras and revision extras.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained

    Revision history functionality is maintained. The code creates a revision when saving a page through the `revisionPayload` and `contentRevisionsApi.save` call in `handleSavePage`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components

    The code follows a clean organization with proper separation of concerns:
    - Models in a dedicated `models` directory
    - Redux store logic in `store/slices`
    - API services in `services`
    - UI components in `components/ui`
    - Feature components in `features/page/components`
    - The business logic is separated from UI rendering in the components

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved

    Translation functionality is preserved using react-i18next. The code includes:
    - A proper i18n configuration with resources
    - Usage of `useTranslation` hook to access translations
    - Consistent use of translation keys with the `t()` function throughout the component

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters

    The URL structure is maintained with React Router. The routes are set up to handle:
    - `/new` for new pages
    - `/:pageUrl` for existing pages
    - The navigation after save properly updates the URL using `navigate`
