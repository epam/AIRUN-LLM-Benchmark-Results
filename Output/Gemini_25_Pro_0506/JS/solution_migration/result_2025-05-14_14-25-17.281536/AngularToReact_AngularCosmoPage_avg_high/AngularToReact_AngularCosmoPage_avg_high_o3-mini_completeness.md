# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
  All CRUD operations and duplication functionality are present through the save, delete, and duplicate handlers in the PageEditor component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
  The code includes a dropdown selector for page type and correctly dispatches the selected value to the Redux store.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
  The onChange handler for the title input automatically generates a URL based on the title value when auto-generation is enabled.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
  The solution includes tag input handling with comma-separated entries, autocomplete suggestions via API calls, and UI for adding/removing tags.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
  Radio buttons for "publish", "draft", and "schedule" are implemented, allowing the user to select the desired publication state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
  When “schedule” is selected, a datetime-local input appears and the save logic converts and handles the scheduled publish date appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
  The code inspects local storage against the global page data and offers options to use or discard a locally stored (newer) version.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
  A NotificationDisplay component is provided and notifications are dispatched on events (e.g., successful save, deletion errors).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
  The save handler explicitly checks that the URL is not empty and that a page type is selected before proceeding.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
  While the solution implements APIs for content, extras, revisions, and tags, some endpoints (e.g., for blocks, comments, files) mentioned in the original $resource are not fully implemented. This step is marked as a failure because the pattern is described but not every original endpoint is explicitly mapped.  
  *Reasoning: Although the structure for API handling is provided and extensible, the complete set of API endpoints from the original code is not fully covered, which creates some uncertainty.*

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
  Extras are processed in the save logic: the code iterates over extras in the global page data and makes API calls to save them.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
  The code creates a new revision via contentRevisionsApi.save and also supports revisions extras saving.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
  The provided migration organizes code into folders (e.g., models, store, services, features) and separates business logic (Redux slices, API services) from UI components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
  The migration includes i18n configuration and uses the useTranslation hook throughout the components.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
  The router is configured to use paths like “/new” and “/:pageUrl” which aligns with the original URL structure requirements.
