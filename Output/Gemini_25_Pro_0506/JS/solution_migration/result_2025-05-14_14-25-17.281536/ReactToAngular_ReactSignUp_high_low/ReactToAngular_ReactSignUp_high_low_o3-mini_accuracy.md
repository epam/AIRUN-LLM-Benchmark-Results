# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The SignupComponent uses ReactiveFormsModule and FormBuilder to create the form, ensuring that Angular’s Reactive Forms are in use.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The signup form defines validators for the name (required, minLength(3), maxLength(60)), for email (required, email), and for password (required, minLength(6)), meeting the requirements.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  Both asyncNameValidator and asyncEmailValidator are implemented to call the API service and check if the name or email exists. While they use control.valueChanges within the async validator—which is somewhat unconventional compared to using the control’s value directly—the intended asynchronous checks are present.  
  Explanation: The implementation deviates from the more common pattern of using the control’s raw value for async validation. This approach may work but is a non-standard pattern, hence the 90% confidence.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The shared FormGroupComponent applies classes such as “has-error” and “has-success” based on the control’s state and displays error messages when the field is touched, dirty, or invalid.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  The onSubmit() method in the SignupComponent validates the form and dispatches AuthActions.signup, triggering the associated NgRx effect that calls the API service.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The FormGroupComponent iterates over the errorMessages array and displays the messages in a <div> when a control is invalid and touched, fulfilling the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  In ngOnInit(), the component calls titleService.setTitle(getAppTitle('Signup')) ensuring the page title is set as specified.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The component dispatches actions via @ngrx/store and the AuthEffects class handles side effects with @ngrx/effects, meeting this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button is disabled when the form is invalid or when the "submitting$" observable (tied to the isLoading state) returns true, ensuring proper behavior during submission.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  The AuthEffects.signup$ effect maps successful responses to signupSuccess and uses catchError to dispatch signupFailure for error responses, satisfying the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component uses Angular lifecycle hooks (ngOnInit, ngOnDestroy) and unsubscribes from subscriptions (even though the optional subscription isn’t actively used), following best practices in structure and lifecycle management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The ApiService makes HTTP requests using Angular’s HttpClient and returns Observables rather than promises, meeting this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The error messages defined in the FormGroupComponent (e.g., "This field is required.", minimum/maximum length messages, email validation, and custom messages for name/email in use) align with the requirements.
