- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a lead paragraph about membership benefits  
  A lead paragraph (<code>&lt;p class="lead"&gt;</code>) is present, describing the benefits of being a member (e.g., subscribing to podcast feeds).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form includes a submit button with appropriate styling and icon  
  The form includes a submit button with class "btn btn-primary form-control" and an inline Font Awesome icon (<code>&lt;i class="fa fa-sign-in"&gt;</code>), meeting the requirements.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the FormGroup component or equivalent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display  
  The provided FormGroupComponent handles styling, error message generation, and feedback icons for the input controls.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Icon component or equivalent is implemented for the signup button  
  Although there is no separate Icon component, the inline usage of the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> element serves as an equivalent for displaying the icon in the signup button.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all validation rules are implemented (name length, email format, password length)  
  The SignupComponent applies synchronous validators: required, minlength (3 for name, 6 for password), maxlength (60 for name), and proper email format validation for the email field.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API integration is complete with proper error handling

  The form element includes the <code>form-horizontal</code> CSS class, indicating the expected horizontal layout is followed.
