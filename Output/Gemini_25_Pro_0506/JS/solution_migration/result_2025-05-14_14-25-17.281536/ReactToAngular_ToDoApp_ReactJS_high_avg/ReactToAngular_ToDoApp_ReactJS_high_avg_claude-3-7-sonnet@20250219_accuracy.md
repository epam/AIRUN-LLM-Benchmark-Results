# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The code clearly implements Angular 14.x framework features, using proper Angular decorators, module structure, and dependency injection patterns. This is evident in the imports from `@angular/core`, use of `@Component` decorators, and the Angular-specific application structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
  
  The implementation properly uses @ngrx/store for state management. This is evident from the imports of `createReducer`, `on`, and `Action` from '@ngrx/store', as well as the definition of a structured store with actions, reducers, and selectors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
  
  The implementation includes a comprehensive `TodoEffects` class that extends `OnInitEffects` and contains multiple effect methods like `initTodos$`, `addTodo$`, etc., to handle side effects. It properly uses the `@ngrx/effects` package.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
  
  The implementation includes well-organized actions in `todo.actions.ts`, reducers in `todo.reducer.ts`, and selectors in `todo.selectors.ts`. These follow NgRx best practices with clear naming conventions and organization.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
  
  All components use appropriate Angular decorators. Components are decorated with `@Component`, and they use `@Input()` and `@Output()` decorators for data binding and event emission, respectively.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators
  
  The implementation properly replaces React refs with Angular's `@ViewChild` decorator, as seen in the `TodoItemComponent` where it uses `@ViewChild('editField') editField!: ElementRef<HTMLInputElement>;` to reference the edit input field.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
  
  The implementation correctly implements Angular's component communication model, using `@Input()` for property binding (e.g., `@Input() todo!: ITodo;`) and `@Output() EventEmitter` for event handling (e.g., `@Output() toggle = new EventEmitter<void>();`).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
  
  The implementation includes Angular services like `UuidService` and `LocalStorageService` for handling business logic and data operations, properly using the `@Injectable` decorator.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
  
  Dependency injection is correctly implemented throughout the application. Services are provided with `providedIn: 'root'` and injected via constructor parameters in components and effects classes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
  
  The implementation uses `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` in presentation components like `TodoHeaderComponent`, `TodoItemComponent`, `TodoListComponent`, and `TodoFooterComponent` for optimized change detection.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
  
  The implementation correctly uses Angular Router with the `AppRoutingModule` that defines routes and uses `useHash: true` to maintain the behavior of the original application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The implementation follows Angular style guide conventions with proper naming (kebab-case for files, PascalCase for classes), organization of files into feature folders, and separation of concerns between components, services, and state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
  
  TypeScript interfaces and types are properly defined and used consistently, with interfaces like `ITodo` and type aliases like `TodoFilterType` being used across the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
  
  All JSX templates have been properly converted to Angular HTML templates with correct Angular-specific syntax for directives (`*ngIf`, `*ngFor`), binding (`[]`, `()`), and template reference variables (`#`).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
  
  React event handlers have been properly replaced with Angular event bindings. For example, `onClick` has been replaced with `(click)`, and keyboard event handlers use Angular's `(keydown)` binding.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs
  
  The implementation does not contain any TODOs or incomplete sections.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules
  
  The application does not implement lazy loading for feature modules. The entire application is bundled in the main `AppModule` without any use of lazy loading techniques such as `loadChildren` in the routing configuration. In Angular, lazy loading is typically implemented using the `loadChildren` syntax in route configurations to load modules on demand when the route is accessed.
