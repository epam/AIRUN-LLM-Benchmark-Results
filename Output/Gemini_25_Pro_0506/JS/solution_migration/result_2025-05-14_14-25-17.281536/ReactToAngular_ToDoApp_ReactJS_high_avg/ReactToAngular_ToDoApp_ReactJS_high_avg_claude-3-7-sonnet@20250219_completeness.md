# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items

    The code includes components and state management for displaying todo items through `app-todo-list` and `app-todo-item` components. The `filteredTodos$` observable from the store is properly passed to the list component. I'm not 100% confident because actual rendering depends on correct implementation of the HTML templates and CSS, but the logic appears sound.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented

    The functionality is implemented in `TodoHeaderComponent` with the `handleNewTodoKeyDown` method, which emits an event when Enter is pressed on a non-empty input. This is handled in the container component by dispatching `addTodo` action, which is processed by effects and reducers to add a todo with a unique ID.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works

    Toggle functionality is implemented in `TodoItemComponent` with the `onToggle` method, which emits events to the container component. The container dispatches `toggleTodo` action, and the state is properly updated via reducers and effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented

    Editing is fully implemented with double-click to edit, blur to save, Enter to save, and Escape to cancel. The code correctly manages editing state in the store with `editingTodoId` and uses appropriate actions: `startEditTodo`, `saveTodo`, and `cancelEditTodo`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented

    Delete functionality is implemented via the destroy button in `TodoItemComponent`, which emits events to the container. The container dispatches `deleteTodo` action, which is handled by the reducer to remove the item from the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented

    The "Mark all as complete" functionality is implemented in `TodoHeaderComponent` with `onToggleAll` method, which emits an event with the checked state. The container dispatches `toggleAllTodos` action, which is handled by effects and reducers to update all todos' completed status.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works

    Filtering is implemented via Angular routing and NgRx. The routes (/all, /active, /completed) are set up in AppRoutingModule, and the container component dispatches `setFilter` actions based on route parameters. The `selectFilteredTodos` selector filters todos based on the current filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items

    The footer component receives `activeCount` input and displays it with proper pluralization using the custom `PluralizePipe`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items

    The "Clear completed" button is implemented in `TodoFooterComponent` and only shown when completed items exist. When clicked, it emits an event to the container, which dispatches `clearCompletedTodos` action, handled by effects and reducers to remove completed items.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage

    Persistence is implemented via `LocalStorageService` and the `persistTodos$` effect, which saves todos to localStorage after relevant state changes. Initial loading from localStorage happens via the `initTodos$` effect.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation

    The app uses Angular's router with `useHash: true` to maintain the original #/ URL structure. The routes are configured in `AppRoutingModule` with paths for '/', '/:filter', and a fallback that all match the original structure.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states

    The code handles empty states with `*ngIf="hasTodos$ | async"` for the todo list and main section. The footer only shows when there are todos. However, I'm less confident in this evaluation because some empty state UI may depend on CSS that isn't fully shown in the code snippets.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly

    Form submissions are handled correctly: todo creation uses keypress events with ENTER_KEY, editing uses both blur and keypress events, and form controls use ngModel for two-way binding. All these implementations follow Angular best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships

    The application follows a clear container/presentational component pattern. The `TodosContainerComponent` is a smart component that manages state via NgRx, while other components are presentational, receiving data via inputs and emitting events via outputs.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved

    All business logic has been correctly migrated from the React app to Angular with NgRx. The same functionality is preserved: creating, editing, toggling, deleting todos, filtering, storing in localStorage, and counting active/completed items.
