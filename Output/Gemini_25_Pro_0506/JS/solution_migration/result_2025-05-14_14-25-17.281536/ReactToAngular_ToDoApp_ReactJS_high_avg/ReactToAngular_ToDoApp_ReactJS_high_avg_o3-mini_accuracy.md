# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The code utilizes standard Angular constructs (NgModule, Components, Decorators) and is structured according to Angular best practices. Although the version number is not explicitly commented in the code, the implementation appears to be compatible with Angular 14.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The code imports StoreModule from '@ngrx/store' and defines the reducers in a typical NgRx structure, clearly indicating the use of @ngrx/store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  The application includes an effects file (todo.effects.ts) where createEffect is used to manage asynchronous side effects, confirming proper use of @ngrx/effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  The implementation contains comprehensive action definitions, a clear reducer with multiple handlers, and well-organized selectors, fulfilling NgRx store requirements.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  All components are decorated with @Component and use @Input and @Output for property binding and event communication, which complies with Angular’s design patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  The React approach of using refs is replaced by Angular’s @ViewChild (e.g., in TodoItemComponent), ensuring proper element access and focus management.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  Components consistently receive data through @Input properties and emit events via @Output EventEmitter, confirming proper component interaction.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  The code defines services (UuidService and LocalStorageService) that encapsulate utility functions and data handling logic, aligning with Angular practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  The services are provided using Angular’s dependency injection (either via "providedIn: 'root'" or in the providers array), ensuring proper DI functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  Several components (TodoHeaderComponent, TodoItemComponent, TodoListComponent, TodoFooterComponent) explicitly use ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush to optimize change detection.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  The routing module (AppRoutingModule) is implemented with defined routes and the useHash option, clearly demonstrating Angular Router usage.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code demonstrates modular file structures, naming conventions, and proper usage of Angular decorators. Although minor naming details might vary based on team preferences, the overall style is consistent with Angular style guidelines.  
  (Explanation: While the implementation is well-organized, explicit module lazy loading or additional feature module separation for large applications is not observed, which is a common Angular style guideline enhancement.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  Interfaces (e.g., ITodo) and types are defined in a separate file and used consistently, ensuring strong typing across the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  The solution offers Angular HTML templates for each component instead of React’s JSX, indicating successful template conversion.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  The event handling logic uses Angular bindings (e.g., (click), (keydown)), successfully replacing React’s event handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  A thorough review of the provided code shows that there are no leftover TODO comments present.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  The routing configuration does not demonstrate any lazy loading of feature modules. All routes are loaded eagerly. Lazy loading is typically implemented by using loadChildren in the route definitions, which is missing in this implementation.
