# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The application uses a selector (selectFilteredTodos) and the TodoListComponent iterates over the list with *ngFor, ensuring that all todo items are displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoHeaderComponent captures new todo text and emits an event on ENTER. The container dispatches an addTodo action, which is handled by an effect that creates and adds a new todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  Each TodoItemComponent fires the toggle event on checkbox changes. The corresponding action and NgRx effect update the todo’s state, ensuring proper toggling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  The editing functionality is provided via events in TodoItemComponent (edit, save, cancel) and is handled by the store actions and effects, allowing a todo’s title to be updated.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent emits a delete event that triggers the deleteTodo action. An effect processes this action to remove the todo from the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  The TodoHeaderComponent includes a toggle-all checkbox that emits an event to update all todos (via toggleAllTodos action) to the completed state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  The application uses routing to set the filter and a selector (selectFilteredTodos) to filter todos accordingly. Routes and actions ensure that switching between filters is properly implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooterComponent receives the activeCount from the store and displays it, verifying that the active items counter is present.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The footer provides a Clear Completed button that dispatches an action. An effect handles this action by filtering out completed todos from the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  The TodoEffects include an effect to persist changes to local storage after every update, and an initialization effect loads todos from local storage on start.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The AppRoutingModule uses hash-based routing (useHash: true) and route parameters to mimic the original URL structure (e.g., /#/all, /#/active).

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  The application conditionally renders components (using *ngIf based on the hasTodos observable). While it hides the todo list when there are no items, the report does not specify a dedicated empty state message. This implementation meets basic expectations, though additional UI feedback might further enhance the user experience.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  Form submissions in the TodoHeaderComponent (via keydown event handling for ENTER) and the use of two-way data binding (ngModel) ensure proper processing of the input.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The migration correctly separates smart (TodosContainerComponent) and presentational components (TodoHeaderComponent, TodoListComponent, TodoItemComponent, TodoFooterComponent) and leverages Angular’s Input/Output bindings to maintain clear relationships.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  The migration covers adding, editing, toggling, deleting, marking all complete, filtering, and clearing completed todos with NgRx state management. Although the migration appears comprehensive, there is a slight uncertainty about nuances in the original business logic (e.g., exact behaviors in edge cases) that might require further testing.
