# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework

    While the answer clearly implements an Angular framework application, it doesn't explicitly mention Angular 14.x version in any import statements or in package.json. However, the code structure, usage of NgRx patterns, and syntax are all compatible with Angular 14.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS

    The application clearly uses ES modules with import/export syntax throughout all files instead of RequireJS. For example:
    ```typescript
    import { Component } from '@angular/core';
    import { Todo } from '../../models/todo.model';
    export interface Todo { ... }
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management

    NgRx store is properly implemented with imports from '@ngrx/store' and proper store configuration in the app module:
    ```typescript
    import { StoreModule } from '@ngrx/store';
    
    StoreModule.forRoot({
      todoFeature: todosFeatureReducer,
      filterFeature: filterFeatureReducer,
    }),
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects

    NgRx effects are correctly implemented for handling side effects, particularly for loading todos from localStorage and saving changes:
    ```typescript
    import { Actions, createEffect, ofType } from '@ngrx/effects';
    
    @Injectable()
    export class TodoEffects {
      // Effects implementation
      loadTodos$ = createEffect(() => ...)
      saveTodos$ = createEffect(() => ...)
    }
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management

    The solution provides comprehensive actions, reducers, selectors, and effects for todo management:
    - Actions for CRUD operations (add, update, remove), filtering, and editing
    - Reducers that handle state transitions immutably
    - Selectors that provide various views of the state (filtered todos, counts)
    - Effects for localStorage interactions

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator

    Services are properly defined with @Injectable decorator:
    ```typescript
    @Injectable({
      providedIn: 'root',
    })
    export class TodoStorageService { ... }
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service

    The TodoStorageService properly implements localStorage for data persistence:
    ```typescript
    getTodos(): Observable<Todo[]> {
      try {
        const todos = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(this.STORAGE_ID) || '[]');
        return of(todos);
      } // ...
    }
    
    saveTodos(todos: Todo[]): Observable<void> {
      try {
        localStorage.setItem(this.STORAGE_ID, JSON.stringify(todos));
        // ...
      }
    }
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators

    All components are properly decorated with @Component and include appropriate metadata:
    ```typescript
    @Component({
      selector: 'app-todo-item',
      template: `...`,
    })
    export class TodoItemComponent implements OnChanges { ... }
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators

    Angular directives are properly implemented with @Directive decorators:
    ```typescript
    @Directive({
      selector: '[appTodoFocus]',
    })
    export class TodoFocusDirective implements OnChanges { ... }
    
    @Directive({
      selector: '[appTodoEscape]',
    })
    export class TodoEscapeDirective { ... }
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)

    Components use proper Angular template syntax throughout:
    ```html
    <section class="main" *ngIf="hasTodos">
    <ul class="todo-list">
      <app-todo-item
        *ngFor="let todo of todos; trackBy: trackById"
        [todo]="todo"
        [isEditing]="editedTodoId === todo.id"
        ...
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))

    Event binding uses proper Angular syntax throughout:
    ```html
    <button class="destroy" (click)="onRemove()"></button>
    <form (ngSubmit)="onAddTodo()" #todoForm="ngForm">
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])

    Property binding uses proper Angular syntax throughout:
    ```html
    <li [ngClass]="{ completed: todo.completed, editing: isEditing }">
    <input [value]="editingTitle" [appTodoFocus]="isEditing" />
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed

    Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed:
    ```typescript
    export class TodoItemComponent implements OnChanges {
      ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges): void {
        if (changes['isEditing'] && this.isEditing) {
          this.editingTitle = this.todo.title;
        }
      }
    }
    
    export class TodoAppComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
      ngOnInit(): void { ... }
      ngOnDestroy(): void { ... }
    }
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models

    TypeScript interfaces are properly used for data models:
    ```typescript
    export interface Todo {
      id: string;
      title: string;
      completed: boolean;
    }
    
    export interface TodoState {
      todos: Todo[];
      editedTodoId: string | null;
      error: any | null;
      loading: boolean;
    }
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services

    Dependency injection is properly implemented throughout:
    ```typescript
    constructor(
      private actions$: Actions,
      private todoStorageService: TodoStorageService,
      private store: Store<AppState>
    ) {}
    
    constructor(private store: Store<AppState>, private route: ActivatedRoute, private router: Router) {
      // ...
    }
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions

    The code follows Angular style guide conventions with:
    - Proper naming (kebab-case for files, PascalCase for classes)
    - Component selectors prefixed with 'app-'
    - Feature modules and organization
    - Clear component responsibilities

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings

    No explicit console.log, error, or warning calls are included in the code except for error handling in main.ts:
    ```typescript
    platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)
      .catch(err => console.error(err));
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)

    TypeScript features are used appropriately throughout:
    - Strong typing for parameters, properties, and return types
    - Interfaces for data models
    - Access modifiers (private, public)
    - Generic types with Observable<T>

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code

    The code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code. All code is production-ready with no "work-in-progress" markers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design

    The application clearly follows the single responsibility principle:
    - Components are divided by function (header, list, item, footer)
    - Smart components (TodoAppComponent) connect to the store
    - Presentational components handle UI concerns
    - Services manage data persistence
    - Store handles state management
    - Effects manage side effects
