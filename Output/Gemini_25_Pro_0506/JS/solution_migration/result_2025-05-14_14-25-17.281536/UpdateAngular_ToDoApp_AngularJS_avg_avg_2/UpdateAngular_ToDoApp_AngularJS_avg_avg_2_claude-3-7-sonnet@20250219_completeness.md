# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list
  
  The application includes a `TodoListComponent` which is responsible for displaying the list of todos. This component is defined in `src/app/components/todo-list/todo-list.component.ts`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos
  
  The application includes a `TodoHeaderComponent` which contains the input field for adding new todos. This component is defined in `src/app/components/todo-header/todo-header.component.ts`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos
  
  The application includes functionality for editing todos within the `TodoItemComponent` defined in `src/app/components/todo-item/todo-item.component.ts`. The component manages editing mode and provides the interface for modifying existing todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos
  
  The application includes filtering functionality within the `TodoFooterComponent` defined in `src/app/components/todo-footer/todo-footer.component.ts`. This component contains the filter links (All, Active, Completed).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics
  
  The application includes count statistics in the `TodoFooterComponent` which displays the number of remaining items and conditionally shows a "Clear completed" button based on the completed count.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos
  
  The application implements add functionality through the `TodoHeaderComponent` which emits an `addTodo` event when a new todo is submitted. This event is handled by the `TodoAppComponent` which dispatches the `addTodo` action to the NgRx store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos
  
  The application implements edit functionality through the `TodoItemComponent` which handles double-click to start editing, blur and submit events to save edits, and includes directives for focus and escape key handling. The `TodoAppComponent` dispatches appropriate NgRx actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos
  
  The application implements delete functionality through the `TodoItemComponent` which contains a destroy button that emits a `remove` event. The `TodoAppComponent` handles this by dispatching the `removeTodo` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed
  
  The application implements the ability to mark todos as completed through the `TodoItemComponent` which includes a checkbox that emits a `toggleCompletion` event. The `TodoAppComponent` handles this by dispatching the `updateTodo` action with the completed status toggled.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The application implements filtering through router links in `TodoFooterComponent` and route handling in `AppRoutingModule`. The filter state is managed in the NgRx store, and filtering logic is implemented in the `selectFilteredTodos` selector.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete
  
  The application implements the "toggle all" functionality in `TodoListComponent` with a checkbox that emits a `toggleAll` event. The `TodoAppComponent` handles this by dispatching the `toggleAllTodos` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos
  
  The application implements a "Clear completed" button in `TodoFooterComponent` which emits a `clearCompleted` event. The `TodoAppComponent` handles this by dispatching the `clearCompletedTodos` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos
  
  The application displays the count of remaining todos in `TodoFooterComponent`, using an NgRx selector `selectRemainingCount` to calculate the count of uncompleted todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage
  
  The application persists todos in localStorage through the `TodoStorageService` and associated NgRx effects. The `saveTodos$` effect listens for relevant actions and saves the current state to localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization
  
  The application loads persisted todos on initialization through the `loadTodos` action dispatched in `TodoAppComponent`'s `ngOnInit` method, which triggers the `loadTodos$` effect that retrieves data from localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing
  
  The application handles escape key press through the `TodoEscapeDirective` which listens for the escape key and emits an event. This directive is applied to the edit input field in `TodoItemComponent`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo
  
  The application automatically focuses the input field during editing through the `TodoFocusDirective` which sets focus on the element when its `shouldFocus` input changes to true. This directive is applied to the edit input field in `TodoItemComponent`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original
  
  The application maintains the same visual appearance by importing the original TodoMVC CSS files (`todomvc-common/base.css` and `todomvc-app-css/index.css`). The HTML structure in the component templates also matches the original layout.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately
  
  The application handles empty todo titles properly by:
  1. Not adding a new todo if the title is empty (in `TodoHeaderComponent`) 
  2. Removing a todo if its title becomes empty during editing (in `onSaveEditedTodo` method in `TodoAppComponent`)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter
  
  The application updates the URL based on the selected filter through Angular's routing. The `AppRoutingModule` defines routes for different filters, and `TodoFooterComponent` contains router links that change the URL. The `TodoAppComponent` also listens to URL changes to update the filter in the store.
