# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list  
  The application clearly includes a TodoListComponent that renders the list of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos  
  The TodoHeaderComponent is responsible for capturing and adding new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos  
  TodoItemComponent contains logic to initiate and save edits, fulfilling the editing requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos  
  Filtering is handled via the TodoFooterComponent (with filter links) and routing, so this requirement is met.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics  
  TodoFooterComponent displays counts for remaining and completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos  
  The addTodo functionality is implemented in the TodoHeaderComponent which dispatches the addTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos  
  Editing is managed in TodoItemComponent through startEdit, saveEdit, and cancelEdit methods and corresponding store actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos  
  Deletion is handled with a remove action triggered from the TodoItemComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed  
  There is functionality to toggle the completed status in the TodoItemComponent and via the toggle-all feature.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)  
  Filtering is achieved using both router-based URLs and store-based filtering in the selectors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete  
  The TodoListComponent includes a checkbox for toggling all todos, dispatching the toggleAllTodos action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos  
  The TodoFooterComponent provides a button which, when activated, dispatches the clearCompletedTodos action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos  
  Remaining todos are computed and displayed via selectors and passed to the TodoFooterComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage  
  The TodoStorageService is used together with NgRx effects to save todos to localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization  
  On initialization, the AppComponent dispatches loadTodos; the corresponding effect reads from localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing  
  The TodoEscapeDirective listens for escape key events and triggers cancellation of editing via the TodoItemComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo  
  The TodoFocusDirective ensures that the input field is focused when a todo item enters edit mode.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original  
  The application imports TodoMVC styles (via assets or angular.json configuration). While the implementation appears correct, minor deviations in styling could occur depending on integration; hence the confidence is slightly less than 100%.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately  
  In the editing logic, if the input becomes empty the todo is removed, aligning with expected behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter  
  The Angular Router configuration and the router events handling in TodoAppComponent ensure the URL reflects the current filter (all, active, or completed).
