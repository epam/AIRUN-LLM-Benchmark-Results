# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed
  
  The `TodoInput` component clearly handles keypress events, checks for the Enter key (code 13), and dispatches the `addTodo` action when valid text is entered.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter
  
  The `TodoList` component uses the `getVisibleTodos` function to filter todos based on the current filter status from Redux state, and renders the appropriate todos accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos
  
  The `App` component includes an input with the "toggle-all" class that dispatches the `toggleAll` action to mark all todos as complete or incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted
  
  The `TodoItem` component includes handlers for toggling completion (`handleToggle`), deletion (`handleDestroy`), and editing (`handleEdit`).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode
  
  The `TodoItem` component has a label with an `onDoubleClick={handleEdit}` event handler that sets the editing state via Redux.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo
  
  The `TodoItem` component includes a `handleKeyDown` function that checks for the Enter key (code 13) and calls `submitEdit()` to save the edited todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value
  
  The `TodoItem` component's `handleKeyDown` function also checks for the Escape key (code 27) and resets the edit text to the original todo title.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The `TodoFooter` component displays the active todo count with appropriate pluralization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The `TodoFooter` component renders filter links for All, Active, and Completed todos with proper URL hash routing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos
  
  The `TodoFooter` component includes a "Clear completed" button that dispatches the `clearCompleted` action when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence
  
  The code includes a `localStorageMiddleware` in the store setup that saves todos to localStorage whenever a relevant action occurs, and it loads the initial state from localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state
  
  Various components use conditional rendering: the main section and footer are only shown if there are todos, the "Clear completed" button only appears if there are completed todos, etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count
  
  The `pluralize` utility function is used in the `TodoFooter` to correctly display "item" or "items" based on the count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components
  
  The application is broken down into focused components: `App`, `TodoInput`, `TodoList`, `TodoItem`, and `TodoFooter`, each with a single responsibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality
  
  The code is well-organized with a clear structure: types in `types/`, utilities in `utils/`, Redux logic in `app/slices/`, components in `components/`, and core application setup in `app/`.
