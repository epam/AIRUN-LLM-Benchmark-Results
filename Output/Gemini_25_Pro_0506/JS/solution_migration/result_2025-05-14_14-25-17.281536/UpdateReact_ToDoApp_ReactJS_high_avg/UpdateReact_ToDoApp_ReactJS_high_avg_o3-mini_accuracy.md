# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all React imports use React 18.x compatible syntax  
  All React-related imports (e.g., ReactDOM.createRoot in index.tsx) confirm the usage of React 18.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all components use functional component syntax with hooks instead of class components  
  Every component is implemented as a function-based component using React hooks.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Redux Toolkit's createSlice is used for state management  
  The code utilizes Redux Toolkit’s createSlice (in todosSlice.ts and filterSlice.ts) for managing state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for all props, state, and Redux store  
  TypeScript interfaces are defined in types/index.ts, and components as well as the Redux store are correctly typed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses immutable state updates in reducers  
  Even though the reducers mutate state directly, they do so via Redux Toolkit’s Immer, ensuring immutability is maintained.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that nanoid is used for ID generation instead of custom UUID implementation  
  The utils file uses nanoid for generating IDs, replacing any custom UUID functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application uses React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate  
  Components such as TodoInput, TodoItem, TodoList, and TodoFooter are wrapped with React.memo to optimize rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that useCallback is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders  
  Event handlers in components are wrapped in useCallback to minimize unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage handling is implemented in a modern way  
  The localStorage operations are encapsulated in modern utility functions (loadState and saveState) with error handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows consistent naming conventions throughout the application  
  Variable, file, and function names follow a coherent and consistent naming scheme across the codebase.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that proper error handling is implemented where necessary  
  Basic error handling is present (e.g., try/catch blocks in localStorage functions and handling missing root element in index.tsx). Although adequate for a TodoMVC example, more robust error management could be considered for production-level code. 

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware  
  The store is configured using configureStore, with custom localStorageMiddleware properly added to the middleware chain.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that React.lazy is used for code splitting where appropriate  
  There is no implementation of React.lazy for code splitting. While this may not be critical for a small application such as TodoMVC, the evaluation criterion explicitly requires its use where applicable.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the codebase has no TODOs remaining  
  No TODO comments remain in the submitted code.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux Provider wraps the application entry point  
  The index.tsx file correctly wraps the application with the Redux Provider.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure strict TypeScript type checking is implemented throughout the application  
  The tsconfig.json file sets "strict": true and enforces other rigorous type checking settings.
