# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The TodoInput component listens for the Enter key (using ENTER_KEY) and dispatches an action to add a new todo when a valid trimmed text is detected.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The TodoList component filters todos based on the current filter (all, active, or completed) using the getVisibleTodos function and renders them accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  The main App component includes an input checkbox that calls the toggleAll action, allowing all todos to be marked complete or incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  Within the TodoItem component, there are handlers for toggling (toggleTodo), editing via double-click (setEditingTodoId), and deletion (destroyTodo).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  The TodoItem component uses an onDoubleClick event on the label to trigger editing mode by dispatching an action to set the editing todo's ID.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  The TodoItem component monitors key events with the onKeyDown handler and calls submitEdit when the Enter key is pressed, ensuring that edits are submitted.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  Pressing Escape in the editing input resets the local edit text to the original title and cancels the editing mode by dispatching setEditingTodoId(null).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooter component renders a count of active (non-completed) todos using a computed activeTodoCount.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The footer provides links for All, Active, and Completed filters, allowing users to change the current view via hash-based navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  The TodoFooter includes a "Clear completed" button that is conditionally rendered when there are completed todos and dispatches clearCompleted when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  The Redux store is configured with a middleware that saves todos to localStorage on changes, and the initial state is loaded from localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  Conditional rendering is implemented in components (e.g., the main section and footer in App.tsx only render if todos exist) ensuring a dynamic UI based on state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  The pluralize function in utils correctly returns "item" or "items" based on the active todo count, as used in the TodoFooter.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The codebase is organized into distinct, focused components (TodoInput, TodoList, TodoItem, TodoFooter, etc.) that each handle a specific piece of functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The project structure is clearly defined with separate directories for app logic, components, types, and utilities, demonstrating a modular design.
