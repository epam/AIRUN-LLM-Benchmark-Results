# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'
  
  The code creates a Header component in `src/components/Header.tsx` that includes an `h1` element with the class `header-title` containing the text "Virtual Piano". This component is then included in the main App component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons
  
  The Controls component in `src/components/Controls.tsx` creates a div with class `btn-container` containing two buttons labeled "Notes" and "Letters" with appropriate CSS classes including `btn-active` for the currently selected mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)
  
  The Piano component in `src/components/Piano.tsx` renders white keys based on `whiteKeysConfig` and sharp keys based on `sharpKeysConfig`, creating a complete piano keyboard with both natural and sharp keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes
  
  In the PianoKey component, each key div includes `data-note={note}` and `data-letter={letter}` attributes, which are essential for correctly displaying the note or letter on each key.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked
  
  The application implements sound playback through the `useAudio` hook which creates audio elements for each note. When a key is clicked, the `handlePlayNote` function calls `playSound(note)` which plays the corresponding audio file.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)
  
  The PianoKey component adds a `piano-key-active` class to keys that are in the `activeNotes` set, providing visual feedback when keys are pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes
  
  The App component includes keyboard event listeners that map keyboard letters to piano notes using the `letterToNoteMap`. When a key is pressed, it triggers `handlePlayNote` and when released it triggers `handleReleaseNote`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked
  
  The Controls component has click handlers that call `onModeChange` to switch the `displayMode` state between 'notes' and 'letters'. The Piano component uses this state to apply the 'letters' class conditionally.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes
  
  The FullscreenButton component triggers the `toggleFullscreen` function which uses the Fullscreen API to enter or exit fullscreen mode, with appropriate event listeners to update the UI state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly
  
  The application uses a Set to track active notes (`activeNotes`) which naturally prevents duplicates and allows for tracking multiple simultaneous key presses.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys
  
  The application implements mouse dragging through a combination of:
  - Tracking mouse state with `isMousePressedRef`
  - Using `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` events on piano keys
  - Implementing `handlePianoMouseLeave` to release notes when the mouse leaves the piano area while pressed

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information
  
  The Footer component in `src/components/Footer.tsx` creates a footer element with a div containing the text "2020", which matches the original application's footer.
