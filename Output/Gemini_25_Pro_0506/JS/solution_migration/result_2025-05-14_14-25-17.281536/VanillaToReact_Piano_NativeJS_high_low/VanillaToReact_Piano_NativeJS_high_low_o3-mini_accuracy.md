# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration  
  The solution provides clear instructions using "npx create-react-app virtual-piano-react --template typescript" and uses ReactDOM.createRoot, which are indicative of React 18 and the proper Create React App with TypeScript setup.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure  
  The code defines TypeScript types and interfaces (e.g., in types.ts and in useAudio.ts with proper Record typings), fulfilling the requirement for typed audio mapping structures.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks  
  All components (Header, Footer, Controls, FullscreenButton, PianoKey, Piano, and App) are implemented as functional components and make use of hooks such as useState, useEffect, useRef, and useCallback.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)  
  The App component properly manages state (activeNotes, displayMode, isFullscreen) using useState, and synchronizes state with side effects using useEffect, effectively handling UI interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels  
  Keyboard events (keydown, keyup) are handled in the App component via useEffect, tying them to the note mapping logic and ensuring proper prevention of default behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events  
  Mouse events are managed in the PianoKey component with React synthetic event handlers (onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseEnter, onMouseLeave), correctly replicating the original behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment  
  Audio files are preloaded in the useAudio hook using a global mapping of HTMLAudioElement objects, ensuring that audio resources are initialized only once and are efficiently managed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility  
  The FullscreenButton component and the corresponding fullscreen logic in the App component use state and event listeners (including vendor-specific events) to manage fullscreen mode, addressing compatibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns  
  The components conditionally build class names using array filtering and template strings (e.g., in PianoKey), demonstrating a proper React approach to conditional styling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate  
  The PianoKey component is wrapped with React.memo to avoid unnecessary re-renders, ensuring improved performance where applicable.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations  
  By preloading audio resources and using controlled state (including refs to manage mouse state), the application addresses audio playback within the React lifecycle effectively.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application  
  Throughout the code, TypeScript types and interfaces are used extensively, ensuring strict type safety and clear interface definitions across components and hooks.
