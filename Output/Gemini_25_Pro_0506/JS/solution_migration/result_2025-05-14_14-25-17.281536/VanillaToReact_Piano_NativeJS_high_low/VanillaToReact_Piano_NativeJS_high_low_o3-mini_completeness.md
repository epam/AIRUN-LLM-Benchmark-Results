# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'  
  The Header component clearly renders an <h1> element containing "Virtual Piano".  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons  
  The Controls component creates two buttons for toggling between 'notes' and 'letters', applying an active class based on the current mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)  
  The Piano component renders keys by mapping over whiteKeysConfig and sharpKeysConfig, ensuring that all keys (except placeholders) are rendered.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes  
  PianoKey components include data attributes (data-note and data-letter) used by CSS to display text, which meets this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked  
  The useAudio hook creates Audio objects for each note and the playSound function resets and plays the corresponding sound on key press. The mapping and connection between notes and audio files is handled clearly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)  
  The code manages an "activeNotes" set and assigns the "piano-key-active" CSS class to keys that are active, ensuring proper visual feedback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes  
  Global keydown and keyup event listeners translate keyboard characters to notes via the letterToNoteMap and call onPlayNote and onReleaseNote accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked  
  The Controls component updates the displayMode (either "notes" or "letters"), and the Piano component applies the proper CSS class based on this state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes  
  The FullscreenButton component and toggleFullscreen function correctly check and request/exit fullscreen mode with appropriate event listeners for fullscreen changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly  
  The use of a Set to track activeNotes and event handlers on both mouse and keyboard events indicate that simultaneous presses are managed appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys  
  Mouse event handlers (onMouseEnter, onMouseLeave, onMouseDown, and onMouseUp) in the PianoKey component, combined with the global mousedown/up events, ensure that dragging across keys properly plays and releases notes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information  
  The Footer component renders a footer with the static year "2020", fulfilling the requirement.
