# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos
  
  The implementation includes a `Header` component that renders an `h1` with "todos" and an input field with the className "new-todo" and appropriate placeholder text. The input field has onChange and onKeyDown event handlers to capture user input and create new todos when Enter is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos
  
  The implementation includes a `TodoList` component that renders a main section with className "main". It includes a toggle-all checkbox container with an input of type checkbox and appropriate label. The component also renders a `ul` with className "todo-list" that maps over the filtered todos and renders `TodoItem` components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button
  
  The `TodoItem` component correctly implements each todo item with a toggle checkbox for completion status, a label displaying the todo title, and a delete button with className "destroy".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode
  
  The `TodoItem` component includes a double-click handler on the label element that sets the editing state to true, which then renders an input field for editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The application implements filtering through the Redux state with a `filter` property and appropriate selectors like `selectFilteredTodos`. The `Footer` component displays filter links, and the app listens to hash changes to update the filter status.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization
  
  The `Footer` component displays the count of active todos with proper pluralization using the `pluralize` utility function.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter
  
  The `Footer` component renders filter links with appropriate styling for the selected filter by comparing the `currentFilter` state with each filter option.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist
  
  The `Footer` component conditionally renders a "Clear completed" button when there are completed todos, checked via `completedTodoCount > 0`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter
  
  The `Header` component captures input and dispatches the `addTodo` action when the Enter key is pressed with a non-empty trimmed value.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos
  
  The `TodoItem` component includes a toggle checkbox that dispatches the `toggleTodo` action when clicked, updating the completion status of individual todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once
  
  The `TodoList` component includes a toggle-all checkbox that dispatches the `toggleAllTodos` action, setting all todos to either completed or active based on the current state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management
  
  The `TodoItem` component implements editing with proper focus management using `useRef` and `useEffect` to focus the edit field and position the cursor at the end of the input when entering edit mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos
  
  The `TodoItem` component includes a delete button that dispatches the `deleteTodo` action when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos
  
  The `Footer` component includes a "Clear completed" button that dispatches the `clearCompletedTodos` action when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status
  
  The application uses appropriate Redux selectors (`selectFilteredTodos`, `selectActiveTodos`, `selectCompletedTodos`) to filter todos based on their completion status and the current filter setting.
