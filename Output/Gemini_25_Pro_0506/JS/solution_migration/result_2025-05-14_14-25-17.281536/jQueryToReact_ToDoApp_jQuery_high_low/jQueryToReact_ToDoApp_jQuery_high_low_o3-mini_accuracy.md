# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18.x  
  The code in index.tsx uses ReactDOM.createRoot from "react-dom/client", which is specific to React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript for type safety  
  All files use TypeScript (.tsx, .ts) and include proper interface/type definitions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for state management  
  The code in "todosSlice.ts" clearly employs createSlice from Redux Toolkit, setting up reducers and actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm nanoid is used for generating unique IDs  
  The implementation of addTodo uses the "nanoid" function within the prepare callback to generate unique IDs.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code uses functional components with hooks instead of class components  
  Every component (Header, TodoList, TodoItem, Footer, etc.) is implemented as a functional component that makes full use of React hooks.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains the same routing functionality with proper route handling  
  The App component sets up a hashchange event listener to manage filtering, replicating the routing behavior of the original app.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Redux store is properly configured with appropriate slices  
  The store is configured in "store/index.ts" with the todos reducer, and the store subscription correctly persists updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the Redux provider is set up in the application entry point  
  In "src/index.tsx", the Redux <Provider> wraps the App component, ensuring state availability across the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for all data structures  
  Interfaces such as Todo and FilterStatus are defined in "src/features/todos/types.ts" to enforce type safety across the app.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows React best practices for component composition  
  The codebase is modularized into well-organized components and custom hooks, following modern React conventions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles keyboard events properly  
  The Header and TodoItem components correctly handle keyboard events: using Enter for submission and Escape for cancellation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application maintains localStorage persistence if implemented  
  The localStorage functionality is implemented in a dedicated service ("localStorage.ts") with proper try-catch error handling, and the Redux store is subscribed to persist state changes.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  While the code appears clean and well-structured, runtime testing is necessary to be 100% certain; however, no obvious issues are present in the provided static code analysis.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify the application implements proper error handling  
  Error handling is implemented in the localStorage service using try-catch blocks; although UI-level error handling is minimal, the critical parts include error logging which is acceptable for this context.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the code is optimized with no unnecessary re-renders  
  The use of functional components and direct state/prop updates suggest minimal unnecessary re-renders. However, more advanced optimizations (such as React.memo) are not used, which is reasonable given the scale of the application.
