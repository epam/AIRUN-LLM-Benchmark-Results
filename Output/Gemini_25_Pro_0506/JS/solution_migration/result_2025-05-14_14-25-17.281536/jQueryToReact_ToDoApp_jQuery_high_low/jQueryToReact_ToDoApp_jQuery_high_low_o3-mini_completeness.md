# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos  
  The Header component renders an <h1> with the title "todos" and an input field with the class "new-todo", which meets the specified requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos  
  The TodoList component renders a "main" section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list (<ul>) composed of TodoItem components when todos exist.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button  
  The TodoItem component clearly provides a toggle checkbox (input with class "toggle"), a label for the title, and a delete button rendered with the class "destroy".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode  
  The TodoItem component listens for the double-click event on the label, triggering editing mode by setting the state variable "editing" to true.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The App component initializes the filter based on the URL hash, and the Footer component renders filter links ("all", "active", "completed"). Additionally, the todos slice and the selector "selectFilteredTodos" implement the filtering logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization  
  The Footer component uses the "pluralize" utility and displays the count of active todos, ensuring correct pluralization based on the count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter  
  The Footer component maps over the filter options and conditionally applies a "selected" class to the link matching the current filter state, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist  
  The Footer component conditionally renders the "Clear completed" button only if there is at least one completed todo, as verified by the "completedTodoCount" selector.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter  
  The Header component listens for the Enter key event on the new todo input field and dispatches the addTodo action when the input is not empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos  
  Each TodoItem includes a checkbox input that, on change, dispatches the toggleTodo action, thereby toggling the completed status.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once  
  The TodoList component provides a toggle-all checkbox that dispatches the toggleAllTodos action to update the completion state of all todos simultaneously.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management  
  The TodoItem component correctly sets focus to the input field when entering editing mode using a ref and useEffect, and it ensures the cursor is placed at the end of the text.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos  
  The TodoItem component includes a delete button that dispatches the deleteTodo action when clicked, allowing for the deletion of individual todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos  
  The Footer component provides a "Clear completed" button which, when clicked, dispatches the clearCompletedTodos action, effectively removing all completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status  
  The todos slice includes selectors (e.g., selectFilteredTodos) that correctly filter todos based on the active filter ("all", "active", or "completed") as set by the URL hash and Redux state.
