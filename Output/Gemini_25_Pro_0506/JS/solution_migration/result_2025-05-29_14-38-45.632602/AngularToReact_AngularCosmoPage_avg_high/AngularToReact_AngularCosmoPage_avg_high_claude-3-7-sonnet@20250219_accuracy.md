# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props
  
  The code consistently uses TypeScript throughout all components, with proper type annotations for variables, functions, props, and state. For example, interfaces like `PageFormProps`, `PageDetailsProps`, and types like `PageFormData` and `Page` are defined and used appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management
  
  Redux Toolkit is correctly implemented using `createSlice` for all state slices (pageSlice, userSlice, adminSlice, notificationSlice). The code properly defines actions, reducers, and initial state using the Redux Toolkit pattern.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components
  
  All components in the code are implemented as functional components using the React.FC type, for example:
  ```typescript
  const PageDetails: React.FC<PageDetailsProps> = ({ isNewPage = false }) => { ... }
  const PageForm: React.FC<PageFormProps> = ({ ... }) => { ... }
  const NotificationToast: React.FC = () => { ... }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately
  
  The code demonstrates proper usage of React hooks throughout. For example:
  - `useState` for local component state (formData, newerVersionExists)
  - `useEffect` for side effects (initialization, local storage, data fetching)
  - `useCallback` for memoized callbacks (handleFormChange)
  - Custom hooks like `useAppDispatch` and `useAppSelector` are also correctly implemented

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource
  
  The code uses the native `fetch` API for all API communication, encapsulated in an `apiClient` utility function that handles request configuration, error handling, and response processing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components
  
  All form inputs in the PageForm component are implemented as controlled components, where their values are stored in state and updated via onChange handlers:
  ```typescript
  <input
    id="title-input"
    type='text'
    value={formData.title}
    onChange={(e) => onFormChange('title', e.target.value)}
    placeholder="about us, contact us"
  />
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation
  
  React Router v6 is correctly implemented with imports from 'react-router-dom' and usage of hooks like useParams, useNavigate, and useLocation. The routing structure is defined in AppRoutes.tsx with proper Route components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization
  
  The code implements internationalization using react-i18next, with proper configuration in i18n.ts and usage of the useTranslation hook in components. Translation keys are used consistently throughout the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization
  
  Code splitting is implemented using React.lazy for component loading, as shown in AppRoutes.tsx:
  ```typescript
  const PageDetails = React.lazy(() => import('../features/page/PageDetails'));
  ```
  This is wrapped in a Suspense component in App.tsx to handle the loading state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations
  
  React.memo is correctly applied to the PageForm component to prevent unnecessary re-renders:
  ```typescript
  export default React.memo(PageForm);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks
  
  All useEffect hooks have appropriate dependency arrays that include all referenced variables from the outer scope:
  ```typescript
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!isNewPage && routePageUrl) {
      let foundNewer = false;
      relevantLsKeys.forEach(key => {
        // ...
      });
      setNewerVersionExists(foundNewer);
    }
  }, [isNewPage, routePageUrl, globalPageData, LS_PREFIX, relevantLsKeys]);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models
  
  TypeScript interfaces are comprehensively defined for all data models, including Page, PageFormData, User, ContentPayload, ContentResponse, NotificationMessage, and other types needed for the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state
  
  The code uses Redux selectors via the useAppSelector custom hook to access state from the Redux store:
  ```typescript
  const globalPageData = useAppSelector((state) => state.page);
  const themePagesFromStore = useAppSelector((state) => state.page.themePages);
  const notifications = useAppSelector((state) => state.notifications.messages);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations
  
  Action creators are correctly exported from the Redux slices and used for state mutations:
  ```typescript
  export const { setPageData, updatePageField, setThemePages, resetPage, pageLoading, pageError } = pageSlice.actions;
  ```
  They are properly dispatched in components and thunks:
  ```typescript
  dispatch(setPageData({ type: newType }));
  dispatch(addNotification({ message: 'Page deleted successfully.', type: 'success' }));
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks
  
  Local storage functionality is correctly implemented using useEffect hooks with proper dependency arrays to handle saving, loading, and comparing data:
  ```typescript
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!isNewPage && routePageUrl) {
      const handler = setTimeout(() => {
        relevantLsKeys.forEach(key => {
          const value = formData[key];
          if (value !== undefined) {
            localStorage.setItem(LS_PREFIX + key, String(value));
          }
        });
      }, 500); // Debounce
      return () => clearTimeout(handler);
    }
  }, [formData, isNewPage, routePageUrl, LS_PREFIX, relevantLsKeys]);
  ```
