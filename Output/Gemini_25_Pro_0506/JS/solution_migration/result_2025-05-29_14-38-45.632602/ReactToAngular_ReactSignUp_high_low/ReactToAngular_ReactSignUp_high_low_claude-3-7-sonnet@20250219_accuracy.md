# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling
  
  The signup component clearly uses Angular's Reactive Forms as shown by the import of `FormBuilder`, `FormGroup`, and `Validators` from '@angular/forms', and the implementation of form creation in the `ngOnInit` method using `this.fb.group`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)
  
  The form configuration properly includes all required validations:
  - Name field: `[Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3), Validators.maxLength(60)]`
  - Email field: `[Validators.required, Validators.email]`
  - Password field: `[Validators.required, Validators.minLength(6)]`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use
  
  Asynchronous validation is correctly implemented using `UniqueNameValidator` and `UniqueEmailValidator` classes that implement the `AsyncValidator` interface and are properly bound to their respective form controls with `updateOn: 'blur'` configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched
  
  The template includes conditional CSS classes for validation feedback:
  - `[class.has-error]="name?.invalid && (name?.dirty || name?.touched)"`
  - `[class.has-success]="name?.valid && (name?.dirty || name?.touched)"`
  - And also includes feedback icons using glyphicons for both success and error states.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions
  
  The `onSubmit()` method correctly extracts form values and dispatches the signup action:
  ```typescript
  const { name, email, password } = this.signupForm.value;
  this.store.dispatch(AuthActions.signup({ name, email, password }));
  ```
  This is then handled by the NgRx effects which use the API service.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails
  
  Error messages are properly displayed using `*ngIf` directives that check for specific validation errors, such as:
  ```html
  <div *ngIf="name?.errors?.['required']">Name is required.</div>
  <div *ngIf="name?.errors?.['minlength']">Name must be at least 3 characters in length.</div>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service
  
  The title service is properly injected in the constructor and used in `ngOnInit` to set the page title:
  ```typescript
  this.titleService.setTitle(getAppPageTitle('Signup'));
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management
  
  The implementation correctly uses NgRx by:
  - Importing the Store from '@ngrx/store'
  - Selecting state with `this.store.select(selectAuthIsLoading)`
  - Dispatching actions with `this.store.dispatch(AuthActions.signup({ name, email, password }))`
  - Defining effects in `AuthEffects` class that respond to actions

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress
  
  The submit button is disabled based on the loading state and form validity:
  ```html
  [disabled]="(isLoading$ | async) || signupForm.pending || signupForm.invalid && signupForm.touched"
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses
  
  The `AuthEffects` class correctly handles both success and error cases:
  ```typescript
  map(response => AuthActions.signupSuccess({ user: response.data })),
  catchError(error => of(AuthActions.signupFailure({ error: error.error || error.message || 'Unknown signup error' })))
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management
  
  The component follows best practices by:
  - Implementing `OnInit` and `OnDestroy` interfaces
  - Using a subscription collection and unsubscribing in `ngOnDestroy`
  - Exposing getters for form controls
  - Separating component logic from template display

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises
  
  The ApiService correctly uses Angular's HttpClient pattern with Observables rather than promises:
  ```typescript
  return of({ data: { id: '123', name, email, message: 'Signup successful' } }).pipe(delay(1000));
  ```
  This is a simulation, but the structure is correct for HttpClient implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements
  
  The error messages in the template match the required specifications:
  - For name field: required, length requirements, and "already in use" checks
  - For email field: required, valid format, and "already in use" checks
  - For password field: required and minimum length requirements
