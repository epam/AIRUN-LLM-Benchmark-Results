# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The component imports FormBuilder, creates a FormGroup, and uses ReactiveFormsModule, which confirms reactive form usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The code applies Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3), Validators.maxLength(60) for the name, Validators.required and Validators.email for email, and Validators.required with Validators.minLength(6) for the password.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  The asyncValidators include UniqueNameValidator and UniqueEmailValidator, which call the API service methods to check if the name or email is already in use.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The template uses conditional classes (has-error/has-success) and icon spans to display visual feedback based on the fields’ validation state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  The onSubmit() method checks form validity before dispatching AuthActions.signup, and the NgRx effect calls the apiService.signup method.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The template includes error message blocks for the name, email, and password fields that activate upon invalid state when the controls are touched or dirty.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  The component calls titleService.setTitle with the generated title from getAppPageTitle('Signup'), fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The component uses the Store to dispatch actions and select state, while the module configuration includes StoreModule.forFeature and EffectsModule.forFeature.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button’s disabled property is bound to the isLoading observable, form pending state, and invalid state, ensuring it is disabled during submission.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  The NgRx effect for signup maps a successful API call to AuthActions.signupSuccess and catches errors to dispatch AuthActions.signupFailure.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component implements OnInit and OnDestroy, uses a Subscription for cleanup, and organizes logic clearly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The ApiService uses HttpClient for making API calls (even though it simulates responses with of() and delay for demonstration).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The error messages for required fields, minlength/maxlength constraints, email format, and async errors (nameInUse, emailInUse) are implemented as per the requirements.
