# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The code clearly uses Angular 14.x features throughout the implementation, including imports from `@angular/core`, usage of Angular decorators like `@Component`, `@Input`, `@Output`, `@ViewChild`, and Angular-specific concepts like modules, component architecture, and dependency injection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management

  NgRx store is properly implemented with imports from `@ngrx/store` and implementation of the store pattern with actions, reducers, selectors, and state interfaces.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects

  The solution includes proper implementation of NgRx effects with `@ngrx/effects`, notably in the `TodosEffects` class that handles loading todos from localStorage and persisting todos when they change.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store

  The solution includes well-structured actions (`todo.actions.ts`), reducers (`todo.reducer.ts`), and selectors (`todo.selectors.ts`) that follow NgRx best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)

  All components properly use `@Component` decorators for component definitions, `@Input` for property binding, and `@Output` with EventEmitter for event handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators

  React refs have been correctly replaced with Angular's `@ViewChild` decorators, as seen in the `TodoItemComponent` and `TodosContainerComponent`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling

  Component communication is implemented correctly using `@Input()` for passing data down and `@Output() EventEmitter` for sending events up the component hierarchy.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic

  The solution uses NgRx store and effects for data handling and business logic, which is an appropriate pattern for Angular applications.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented

  Dependency injection is properly implemented throughout the application, with services, store, and effects being injected into components via constructor parameters.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate

  Change detection strategies are properly applied using `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` on components to optimize performance.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation

  Angular Router is implemented with proper route configuration in `app-routing.module.ts` and used in the components, especially for filter navigation in the footer.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions

  The code follows Angular style guide conventions with proper naming, file organization, and coding patterns that match Angular best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application

  TypeScript interfaces and types are well-defined and consistently used throughout the application, including the `ITodo` interface and proper typing for all variables and parameters.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates

  JSX templates have been properly converted to Angular HTML templates with appropriate Angular directives like `*ngFor`, `*ngIf`, property binding `[]`, and event binding `()`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings

  React event handlers have been replaced with Angular event bindings such as `(click)`, `(change)`, `(input)`, etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs

  The code does not contain any TODOs or unfinished sections. All implementation details are complete.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules

  There is no implementation of lazy loading for feature modules in the provided code. The entire application is loaded eagerly through the main `AppModule`. For lazy loading, we would expect to see routes with `loadChildren` property that uses dynamic imports.
