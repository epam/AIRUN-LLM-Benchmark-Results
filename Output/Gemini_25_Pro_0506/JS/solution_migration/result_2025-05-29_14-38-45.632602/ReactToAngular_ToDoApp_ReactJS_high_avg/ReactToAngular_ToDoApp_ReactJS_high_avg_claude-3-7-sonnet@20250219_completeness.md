# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items
  
  The implementation properly displays all todo items through the `todos-container.component.html` with an ngFor loop iterating over filtered todos: `*ngFor="let todo of (filteredTodos$ | async); trackBy: trackByTodoId"`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented
  
  The implementation includes the functionality to add new todo items in the `handleNewTodoKeyDown` method of the `TodosContainerComponent`, which dispatches the `addTodo` action when the Enter key is pressed with a non-empty input.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works
  
  The implementation allows toggling todo items through the `onToggleTodo` method in `TodosContainerComponent`, which dispatches the `toggleTodo` action. This is connected to the toggle event from `TodoItemComponent`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented
  
  The implementation includes editing functionality through double-click on a todo item label (`onEdit` method), and supports saving with Enter or blur events, and canceling with Escape key in the `TodoItemComponent`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented
  
  The implementation includes deleting todo items through the "destroy" button in `TodoItemComponent`, which emits an event caught by `TodosContainerComponent` that dispatches the `deleteTodo` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented
  
  The implementation includes a "toggle-all" checkbox in the `todos-container.component.html` that calls `toggleAll` method, which dispatches the `toggleAllTodos` action with the checked state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works
  
  The implementation includes routing for different filter states (/, /active, /completed) and the `selectFilteredTodos` selector filters todos based on the current filter value from the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The implementation passes the active todo count to the footer component: `[activeTodoCount]="(activeTodoCount$ | async)!"` which then displays it with proper pluralization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items
  
  The implementation includes a "Clear completed" button in the footer that emits an event to the container component, which dispatches the `clearCompletedTodos` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage
  
  The implementation uses NgRx effects to persist todos to localStorage whenever they change, through the `persistTodos$` effect in `TodosEffects`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation
  
  The implementation maintains the URL structure with routes for '/', '/active', and '/completed' in the `app-routing.module.ts` file.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states
  
  The implementation conditionally renders the main section and footer only when there are todos: `*ngIf="(totalTodoCount$ | async) > 0"`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly
  
  The implementation correctly handles form submissions by preventing default actions on Enter key, validating inputs (checking for empty strings), and focusing input fields appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships
  
  The implementation maintains proper component relationships with a container component (`TodosContainerComponent`) that manages state and child presentational components (`TodoItemComponent`, `TodoFooterComponent`) that emit events back to the container.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved
  
  The implementation preserves all business logic from the original application, including todo management, filtering, local storage persistence, and UI behaviors, now structured according to Angular and NgRx patterns.
