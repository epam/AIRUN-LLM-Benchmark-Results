# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The answer explicitly states the migration is to Angular 14.x and all Angular files (modules, components, etc.) adhere to this framework.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The provided code imports and configures @ngrx/store via StoreModule.forRoot with the todosReducer, which confirms state management using NgRx.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  The solution includes a properly implemented TodosEffects class decorated with @Injectable and registered in EffectsModule.forRoot.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  The answer features a full set of actions, a reducer (todosReducer), and selectors that adequately manage the state of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  Each component file clearly declares @Component and uses @Input and @Output where necessary.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  Instead of using React refs, the Angular components correctly use the @ViewChild decorator (e.g., in TodoItemComponent and TodosContainerComponent).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  The code shows proper usage of @Input for passing data down and @Output with EventEmitter for event propagation among components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  While traditional Angular services are not explicitly created for all business logic, the TodosEffects class (an Angular service) handles localStorage interactions and side effects, effectively managing data handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  Services like Store and Actions are injected through the constructors in various components and effects, demonstrating correct dependency injection.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  Several components (TodoItemComponent, TodoFooterComponent, TodosContainerComponent) use ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush for improved performance.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  The routing module (AppRoutingModule) along with routerLink directives in the templates confirms the use of Angular Router.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The file structure, naming conventions, and coding style (such as separation into modules, components, and store-related files) align well with Angular style guide recommendations.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  Interfaces like ITodo and well-typed files throughout the code indicate proper use of TypeScriptâ€™s type system.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  All templates are standard Angular HTML templates rather than JSX, which confirms the proper conversion.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  React-style event handlers have been replaced by Angular bindings; for example, (keydown), (click), and (blur) are used in the templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  The code does not include any code comments or placeholders marked as TODO.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  The provided solution wraps the entire application in a single module without any indication of lazy-loaded feature modules. No routes or modules are set up to load lazily.
