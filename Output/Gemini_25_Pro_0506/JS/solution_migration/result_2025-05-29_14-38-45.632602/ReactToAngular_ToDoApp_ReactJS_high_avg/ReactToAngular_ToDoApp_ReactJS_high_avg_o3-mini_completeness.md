# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The migration includes an Angular component (TodosContainerComponent) that uses an *ngFor loop over the filtered todos. The selector and template correctly display each todo item.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodosContainerComponent provides an input field with a keydown handler that dispatches the addTodo action when the ENTER key is pressed. This confirms that adding new todo items is implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  The TodoItemComponent provides an input checkbox that calls onToggle() to dispatch the toggleTodo action. The reducer then updates the todo’s completed status, ensuring this functionality is correctly implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  The editing functionality is provided in TodoItemComponent with events for edit, save, and cancel. The component switches to an input field for editing, and the corresponding NgRx actions (editTodo, saveTodo, cancelEditTodo) manage the editing state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent includes a destroy button that dispatches the deleteTodo action. The reducer appropriately removes the todo by filtering it out from the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  The TodosContainerComponent template includes a "toggle-all" checkbox. Its associated method dispatches toggleAllTodos with the proper completed status, confirming the implementation of this feature.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  The selected filter is derived from the router URL and dispatched to update state via setFilter. The selectors in the store (selectFilteredTodos) correctly filter todos based on the current filter value.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The Footer Component (TodoFooterComponent) receives the activeTodoCount from the store and displays it correctly. This is verified by its binding in the template and the utility method for pluralizing the word “item.”

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The TodoFooterComponent provides a "Clear completed" button that emits an event. The TodosContainerComponent then dispatches the clearCompletedTodos action, which the reducer handles by filtering out completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  The integration of NgRx Effects shows a persistTodos$ effect that uses utility methods (Utils.storeSet) to write the todos to localStorage upon state changes, and loadTodos$ reads from localStorage when loading the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The AppRoutingModule defines routes for the root, "active," and "completed" paths, and even includes a wildcard path for unknown URLs, thereby preserving the URL structure similar to the original application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  The TodosContainerComponent template uses an *ngIf directive to conditionally display components (like the main section and footer) only when there are todos. This ensures that empty states (no todos) are handled appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  The form submission is handled within the keydown event of the new-todo input, where the ENTER key triggers adding a todo. The logic properly prevents default behavior and ensures a trimmed value is considered.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The container component orchestrates interactions between the items and footer components. Component communication is managed via Input/Output binding and event dispatching through NgRx actions, confirming proper component relationships.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  The NgRx reducer and effects capture all core business logic for adding, toggling, editing, deleting, filtering, and persisting todos. The provided logic mirrors the original TodoMVC application’s behavior.
