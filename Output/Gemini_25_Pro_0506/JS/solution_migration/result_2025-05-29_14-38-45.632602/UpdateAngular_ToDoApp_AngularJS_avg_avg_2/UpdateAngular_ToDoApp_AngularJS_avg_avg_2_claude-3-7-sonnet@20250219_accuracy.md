# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The code clearly indicates the use of Angular framework with version 14.x features. This is evident from the imports from '@angular/core' and other Angular packages, along with the use of Angular 14.x-compatible syntax and features like standalone components.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS
  
  The code exclusively uses ES modules with import/export syntax throughout all files, which is the standard module system in Angular 14.x applications.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management
  
  The code thoroughly implements NgRx store for state management with proper imports from '@ngrx/store' and implementation of store features like reducers, actions, and selectors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects
  
  The code includes a complete implementation of NgRx effects for handling side effects, particularly for todo operations and localStorage persistence. The TodoEffects class properly implements the OnInitEffects interface.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management
  
  The code contains comprehensive implementations of actions (todo.actions.ts, filter.actions.ts), reducers (todo.reducer.ts, filter.reducer.ts), selectors (todo.selectors.ts, filter.selectors.ts), and effects (todo.effects.ts) for complete todo management functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator
  
  Services like TodoStorageService are properly decorated with @Injectable and use the 'providedIn: root' syntax for tree-shakable injection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service
  
  The TodoStorageService properly implements localStorage for todo persistence with methods to get and save todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators
  
  All components (TodoHeaderComponent, TodoListComponent, TodoItemComponent, TodoFooterComponent, AppComponent) use the @Component decorator with appropriate metadata.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators
  
  The code includes properly implemented custom directives (TodoFocusDirective, TodoEscapeDirective) with the @Directive decorator.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)
  
  Component templates make appropriate use of Angular template syntax, including *ngFor, *ngIf, and async pipe throughout the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))
  
  Event binding is correctly implemented using Angular syntax such as (click), (change), (ngSubmit), etc., throughout the templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])
  
  Property binding is correctly implemented using Angular syntax such as [checked], [ngClass], etc., throughout the templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed
  
  The code properly implements lifecycle hooks such as OnInit and OnChanges where needed, particularly in the AppComponent and directives.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models
  
  The code defines and uses TypeScript interfaces for data models, particularly the Todo interface and FilterType type in todo.model.ts.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services
  
  Dependency injection is correctly implemented throughout the application, with services, store, and router properly injected in component constructors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code follows Angular style guide conventions, including proper naming, file organization, and module structure.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings
  
  The TodoListComponent has an error in its implementation. The `map` operator is used but not imported from 'rxjs/operators'. This would cause a compilation error. The same issue exists in the TodoFooterComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)
  
  The code makes excellent use of TypeScript features including interfaces, type annotations, generics, and proper typing for functions and variables.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code
  
  The final code doesn't contain any TODOs or commented-out code. There are some comments explaining implementation details, but these are appropriate and don't include TODOs.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design
  
  The application follows the single responsibility principle with components having clear, focused responsibilities: TodoHeaderComponent for adding todos, TodoItemComponent for displaying and editing individual todos, TodoListComponent for managing the list, and TodoFooterComponent for filtering and summary operations.
