# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The answer explicitly states the migration to Angular 14.x and the code structure (e.g., Angular CLI project, NgModule, etc.) is consistent with Angular 14.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
  The code uses standard ES module syntax with import/export, confirming the usage of ES modules.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
  The answer includes the use of StoreModule.forRoot, action definitions, reducers, and selectors for managing todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
  The answer defines TodoEffects and registers it via EffectsModule.forRoot, demonstrating proper use of NgRx effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
  The provided code includes comprehensive definitions for actions (e.g., addTodo, removeTodo, etc.), reducers, selectors for filtered data, and effects to handle side effects like localStorage persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
  The TodoStorageService is decorated with @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }), ensuring it is properly registered for dependency injection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
  The TodoStorageService directly accesses localStorage (using getItem and setItem) for data persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
  All components (e.g., TodoHeaderComponent, TodoListComponent, etc.) use the @Component decorator with appropriate metadata.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
  Both directives (TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective) use the @Directive decorator correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
  The templates make use of Angular template syntax such as *ngFor, *ngIf, and routerLink for dynamic rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
  The code uses event binding syntax such as (ngSubmit), (click), and (blur) consistently in the templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
  The code demonstrates property binding using constructs like [ngClass] and input bindings (e.g., [checked]).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
  Lifecycle hooks, such as OnInit in components and ngOnChanges in the directive, are implemented where necessary.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
  The Todo model is defined as a TypeScript interface, along with a FilterType type, ensuring type safety.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
  Components and services receive dependencies via constructor injection (e.g., Store, Router, TodoStorageService).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The structure—with separation into modules, components, directives, services, and the use of OnPush change detection in some components—largely adheres to Angular style guidelines.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
  While the provided code appears to be fully functional and error-free based on the review, actual runtime testing is required to be completely sure. The structure suggests no obvious issues.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
  Throughout the code, TypeScript is used with proper type annotations, interfaces, and modern syntax, ensuring clarity and correctness.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
  The final code is free of TODO comments; only explanatory comments are present which do not indicate unfinished work.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design  
  The application is structured into distinct components (header, list, item, footer), directives, services, and store files, each handling a specific responsibility.
