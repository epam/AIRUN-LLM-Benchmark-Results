# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list  
  The provided code includes a TodoListComponent that displays the todo list.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos  
  The TodoHeaderComponent handles input and dispatches an action to add new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos  
  The TodoItemComponent offers editing functionality (starting, saving, and canceling edits).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos  
  Filter functionality is implemented via the TodoFooterComponent, which provides filter links and dispatches filter actions based on the URL.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics  
  The TodoFooterComponent displays the count of remaining todos along with other statistics.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos  
  New todos are added via the dispatch in TodoHeaderComponent (using the addTodo action).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos  
  Editing is implemented in the TodoItemComponent, which handles editing state and dispatches an update action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos  
  The removal of todos is implemented through the removeTodo action triggered by the TodoItemComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed  
  Toggling the completed status is implemented both at the individual todo level and via the toggleAllTodos action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)  
  Filtering is provided via router links in the TodoFooterComponent and filtering logic in selectors and AppComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete  
  The TodoListComponent includes an input for toggling all todos’ complete/incomplete state via the toggleAllTodos action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos  
  Clearing completed todos is implemented in the TodoFooterComponent, dispatching the clearCompletedTodos action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos  
  The TodoFooterComponent displays the count using the remainingCount$ observable, which correctly computes the remaining todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage  
  The TodoStorageService uses localStorage (getItem and setItem) to persist todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization  
  The TodoEffects class dispatches a loadTodos action on initialization (ngrxOnInitEffects) to load todos from localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing  
  The TodoEscapeDirective listens for the escape key press, triggering the cancelEdit event in the TodoItemComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo  
  The TodoFocusDirective is used in the TodoItemComponent to apply focus when a todo is being edited.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original  
  The migration includes usage of similar CSS files (base.css and index.css) and component structure mirroring TodoMVC. Although the code structure is aligned with the original, visual appearance can only be empirically confirmed by running the application, so confidence is slightly less than 100%.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately  
  Both in the addTodo method (trimming input and checking for non-empty) and in the updateTodo reducer (filtering out empty titles), empty todo titles are handled appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter  
  The AppComponent listens to router events and dispatches filter actions based on the URL (using paths such as “active” or “completed”), updating the URL based on the selected filter.
