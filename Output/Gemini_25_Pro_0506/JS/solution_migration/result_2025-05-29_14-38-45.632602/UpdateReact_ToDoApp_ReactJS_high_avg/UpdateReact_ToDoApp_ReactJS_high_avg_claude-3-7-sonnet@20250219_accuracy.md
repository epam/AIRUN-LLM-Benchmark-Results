# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all React imports use React 18.x compatible syntax
  
  The code correctly uses React 18 imports, including the modern `createRoot` API from `react-dom/client` in the entry point.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all components use functional component syntax with hooks instead of class components
  
  All components are implemented as functional components using hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`, and `useRef`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Redux Toolkit's createSlice is used for state management
  
  Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` is properly used in `todosSlice.ts` and `filterSlice.ts` to create reducers with immutable update patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for all props, state, and Redux store
  
  TypeScript interfaces are well-defined for all components, state structures, and the Redux store, including `ITodo`, `FilterStatus`, `TodosState`, etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses immutable state updates in reducers
  
  The implementation uses Redux Toolkit which handles immutable updates automatically, and the reducers follow the pattern correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that nanoid is used for ID generation instead of custom UUID implementation
  
  The code imports and uses the `nanoid` package for ID generation in `utils/index.ts` with the `generateId` function.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application uses React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate
  
  React.memo is correctly applied to all components that could benefit from it, including TodoItem, TodoList, TodoInput, and TodoFooter.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that useCallback is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  
  The code consistently uses `useCallback` for all event handlers in components, providing proper dependency arrays.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage handling is implemented in a modern way
  
  LocalStorage handling is modernized with dedicated `loadState` and `saveState` utility functions in `utils/index.ts` with proper error handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows consistent naming conventions throughout the application
  
  The code maintains consistent naming conventions for files, components, variables, and functions following React and TypeScript best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper error handling is implemented where necessary
  
  Error handling is implemented for localStorage operations, with console warnings for failures. The root element finding also includes fallback logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware
  
  The Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware, including a custom middleware for persisting todo items to localStorage.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that React.lazy is used for code splitting where appropriate
  
  The code does not implement any code splitting with React.lazy. For a small application like this, it might not be necessary, but the evaluation step explicitly requires it.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the codebase has no TODOs remaining
  
  There are no TODO comments or placeholders left in the codebase. All features have been fully implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux Provider wraps the application entry point
  
  The Redux Provider correctly wraps the App component in the entry point file `index.tsx`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure strict TypeScript type checking is implemented throughout the application
  
  The tsconfig.json includes `"strict": true` and the code demonstrates consistent use of proper TypeScript typing throughout the application.
