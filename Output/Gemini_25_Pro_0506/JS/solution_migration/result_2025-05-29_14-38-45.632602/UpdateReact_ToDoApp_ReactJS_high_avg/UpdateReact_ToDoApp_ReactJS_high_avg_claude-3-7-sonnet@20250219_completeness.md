# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed
  
  The `TodoInput` component includes code to handle the Enter key press event, validate the input, dispatch the `addTodo` action, and clear the input field.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter
  
  The `TodoList` component fetches todos from the Redux store, applies filtering through the `getVisibleTodos` function based on the current filter state, and renders the filtered list.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos
  
  The `App` component includes a toggle-all checkbox with an onChange handler that dispatches the `toggleAll` action to mark all todos as completed or active.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted
  
  The `TodoItem` component includes handlers for toggle, edit, and destroy operations, all of which dispatch the appropriate Redux actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode
  
  In the `TodoItem` component, the label has an `onDoubleClick={handleEdit}` handler that dispatches the `setEditingTodoId` action to enable editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo
  
  The `TodoItem` component's `handleKeyDown` function checks for the Enter key and calls `submitEdit()` which dispatches the `saveTodo` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value
  
  The `TodoItem` component's `handleKeyDown` function checks for the Escape key, resets the edit text to the original todo title, and dispatches `setEditingTodoId(null)` to exit editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The `TodoFooter` component receives and displays the `activeTodoCount` with appropriate pluralization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The `TodoFooter` component renders filter links for All, Active, and Completed todos with appropriate URL hash values.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos
  
  The `TodoFooter` component includes a "Clear completed" button that dispatches the `clearCompleted` action, with conditional rendering based on whether there are completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence
  
  The Redux store setup includes a custom middleware that saves todos to localStorage whenever a todos-related action is dispatched, and loads from localStorage on initial state creation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state
  
  The application conditionally renders UI elements based on todo state, such as hiding the footer when there are no todos, hiding the "Clear completed" button when there are no completed todos, and not rendering the main section when there are no todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count
  
  The `pluralize` utility function is used in the `TodoFooter` component to correctly pluralize "item" based on the `activeTodoCount`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components
  
  The application has been broken down into focused components: `App`, `TodoInput`, `TodoList`, `TodoItem`, and `TodoFooter`, each with specific responsibilities.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality
  
  The code is well-organized with a clear structure:
  - `/app` for application core (App component, store, slices)
  - `/components` for UI components
  - `/types` for TypeScript interfaces and types
  - `/utils` for utility functions and constants
