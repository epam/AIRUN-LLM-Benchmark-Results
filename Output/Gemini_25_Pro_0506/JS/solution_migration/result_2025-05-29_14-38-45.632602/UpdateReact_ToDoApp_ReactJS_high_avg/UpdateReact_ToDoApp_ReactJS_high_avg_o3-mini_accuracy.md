# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all React imports use React 18.x compatible syntax  
  All React imports (e.g., using createRoot from "react-dom/client") are compatible with React 18.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all components use functional component syntax with hooks instead of class components  
  Every component has been implemented as a functional component with appropriate hooks replacing class components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Redux Toolkit's createSlice is used for state management  
  The code uses createSlice from Redux Toolkit in both todosSlice and filterSlice.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for all props, state, and Redux store  
  The application defines a clear set of interfaces/types (e.g., ITodo, TodosState, FilterState) and uses them consistently in components and Redux store configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses immutable state updates in reducers  
  The reducers in createSlice correctly leverage the immer library under the hood to enable immutable state updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that nanoid is used for ID generation instead of custom UUID implementation  
  The generateId function imports and uses nanoid for generating IDs.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application uses React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate  
  React.memo is used in components (e.g., TodoInput, TodoItem, TodoList, TodoFooter) to optimize rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that useCallback is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders  
  Many event handlers across components are wrapped in useCallback, ensuring that functions are only re-created when dependencies change.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage handling is implemented in a modern way  
  The code provides loadState and saveState utility functions that handle errors, making localStorage usage robust.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows consistent naming conventions throughout the application  
  The file naming, variable names, and function names are consistent and descriptive across the codebase.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that proper error handling is implemented where necessary  
  Error handling is implemented in localStorage functions and the index.tsx entry point (checking for a root container). Some areas could potentially receive more robust error handling, but the overall implementation is satisfactory.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware  
  The Redux store is correctly configured with additional middleware to handle localStorage persistence.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that React.lazy is used for code splitting where appropriate  
  There is no usage of React.lazy (or code-splitting techniques) detected in the application. Code splitting could help optimize performance, especially for larger applications, but it has not been implemented in the current codebase.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the codebase has no TODOs remaining  
  There are no TODO comments present in the provided code.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux Provider wraps the application entry point  
  The index.tsx file correctly wraps the App component with the Redux Provider.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure strict TypeScript type checking is implemented throughout the application  
  The tsconfig.json file is set with strict options, and proper TypeScript types are applied throughout the codebase.
