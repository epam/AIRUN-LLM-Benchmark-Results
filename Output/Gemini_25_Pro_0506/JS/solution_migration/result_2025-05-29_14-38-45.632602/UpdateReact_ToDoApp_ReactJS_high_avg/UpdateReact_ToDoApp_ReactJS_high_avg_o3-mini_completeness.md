# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The TodoInput component listens for the Enter key (using ENTER_KEY) in its onKeyDown handler and dispatches the addTodo action when a non-empty trimmed value is entered.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The TodoList component uses the getVisibleTodos helper to filter the todos based on the nowShowing state from Redux and then maps those items into TodoItem components.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  In the App component, the toggle-all checkbox is implemented. Its onChange handler dispatches the toggleAll action based on the input’s checked status.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  The TodoItem component provides toggling via a checkbox (calling toggleTodo), deletion via a button (calling destroyTodo), and editing via input interactions (using saveTodo and setEditingTodoId).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  The TodoItem component attaches an onDoubleClick handler on the label which dispatches setEditingTodoId, thereby enabling editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  In the editing mode within TodoItem, the onKeyDown handler checks for the Enter key and calls the submitEdit function, which dispatches saveTodo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  The TodoItem component’s onKeyDown handler checks for the Escape key and cancels editing by resetting the local editText state to the original todo.title and dispatching setEditingTodoId(null).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooter component receives activeTodoCount as a prop and displays it within a span with class "todo-count".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  TodoFooter includes filter links for "All", "Active", and "Completed" using anchor tags with appropriate class management based on the current filter state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  In TodoFooter, if the completedTodoCount is greater than 0, a button with class "clear-completed" is rendered and wired to dispatch clearCompleted.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  The Redux store config includes a custom middleware that, upon any todos-related action, saves the todos to localStorage using the saveState utility.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  The App component conditionally renders the main section, TodoList, and TodoFooter based on whether there are any todos present. Additionally, the TodoList and TodoFooter components check if there are no todos to display.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  The TodoFooter component uses the pluralize utility function to correctly pluralize the word "item" depending on the activeTodoCount.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The code separates concerns into well-scoped components: TodoInput, TodoItem, TodoList, and TodoFooter, each handling only its specific responsibilities.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The project structure is organized into directories such as app (for slices and store), components (for UI parts), types (for TypeScript interfaces), and utils (for helper functions and constants), reflecting feature-based organization.
