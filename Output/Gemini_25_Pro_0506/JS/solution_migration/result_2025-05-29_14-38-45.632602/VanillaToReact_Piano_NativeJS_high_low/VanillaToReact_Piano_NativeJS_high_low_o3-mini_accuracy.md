# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration  
  The provided solution explicitly instructs to use "npx create-react-app virtual-piano --template typescript" and uses ReactDOM.createRoot, which confirms React 18 with a TypeScript setup.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure  
  The solution defines a dedicated TypeScript file (src/types/index.ts) with the PianoKeyInfo interface and uses these types in configuration and component files.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks  
  All components (Header, Footer, Controls, PianoKey, Piano, FullscreenButton, and App) are implemented as functional components, and hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useRef) are used appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)  
  The main App component manages UI state using useState and handles side effects with useEffect for events such as keyboard and fullscreen changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels  
  Keyboard event handling is implemented in the App component using useEffect with global event listeners for keydown and keyup events, ensuring proper management of note playing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events  
  The PianoKey component correctly utilizes Reactâ€™s synthetic events for mouse interactions (onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseOut, onMouseMove) and even supports basic touch events.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment  
  The solution creates HTMLAudioElement instances for each note inside a configuration file and preloads them using audio.load(), ensuring the audio system integrates well within React.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility  
  The code employs a toggleFullscreen function using requestFullscreen and exitFullscreen. Although vendor-prefixed event listeners are commented out (which might be required for broader compatibility on some older browsers), the approach conforms to standard React patterns. The slight reduction in confidence is due to reliance on standard API without active vendor prefix support.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns  
  The PianoKey component builds class names conditionally by filtering an array of classes and joins them, ensuring dynamic styling is applied based on state (active, sharp, etc.).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate  
  The PianoKey component is wrapped in React.memo to avoid unnecessary re-renders during frequent UI updates, which is an appropriate optimization.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations  
  Audio playback is managed reliably through state changes and useCallback hooks, ensuring that note playing and stopping occur in sync with component updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application  
  The solution leverages TypeScript effectively by defining interfaces, types, and appropriately typing components and hooks, ensuring type safety across the application.
