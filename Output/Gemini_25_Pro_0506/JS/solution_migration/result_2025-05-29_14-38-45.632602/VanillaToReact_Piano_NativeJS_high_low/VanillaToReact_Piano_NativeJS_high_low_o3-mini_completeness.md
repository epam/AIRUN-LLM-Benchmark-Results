# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'  
  The Header component returns a header element with an h1 containing the text "Virtual Piano".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons  
  The Controls component renders a div with the class "btn-container" and includes two buttons with the proper labels.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)  
  The Piano component filters white (natural) keys and sharp keys (including a placeholder for the E-F gap) and renders them accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes  
  Each PianoKey component renders with proper data attributes (data-note and data-letter) for the keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked  
  The playNote function retrieves the correct audio from the soundMapper and plays it when a key is clicked, resetting the currentTime to 0.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)  
  The PianoKey component applies the "piano-key-active" class when the corresponding note is active, ensuring visual feedback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes  
  Global keyboard event listeners are implemented in App.tsx to map key presses (via letterToKeyInfoMap) to playing and stopping notes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked  
  The activeDisplayMode state in App.tsx is toggled via the Controls component, which results in conditional class rendering on the Piano component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes  
  The FullscreenButton calls the toggleFullscreen function. This function correctly requests or exits fullscreen while updating the isFullscreen state accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly  
  The app uses a Set (activeNotes) to manage active keys, allowing multiple keys to be pressed concurrently without conflict.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys  
  Mouse events (onMouseDown, onMouseMove, onMouseOut) along with a reference (mousePlayedNotesRef) are implemented to manage continuous interaction when dragging across keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information  
  The Footer component is implemented to display a footer element containing the year "2020".
