# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos
  
  The code includes a `HeaderComponent` in `src/components/Header.tsx` that renders an `<h1>` with "todos" text and an input field with the class "new-todo". This input has appropriate event handlers for adding new todos when Enter is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos
  
  The `TodoListComponent` in `src/components/TodoList.tsx` implements a main section with the class "main" that includes a toggle-all checkbox and renders a list of todos inside a `<ul>` with class "todo-list".

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button
  
  The `TodoItemComponent` in `src/components/TodoItem.tsx` renders each todo item with a toggle checkbox (class "toggle"), a label for the title, and a delete button (class "destroy").

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode
  
  In `TodoItemComponent`, the label has an `onDoubleClick` handler that sets the component's `editing` state to true and prepares the edit field with the current title. The component also applies the "editing" class to the list item when in editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The application implements filtering through React Router and Redux. The `App.tsx` component uses route parameters to determine the filter, and the `todosSlice.ts` has selectors for filtering todos based on their completion status.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization
  
  The `FooterComponent` in `src/components/Footer.tsx` displays the count of active todos with proper pluralization using the `pluralize` helper function from `src/utils/helpers.ts`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter
  
  The `FooterComponent` includes filter links using React Router's `Link` component. It applies the "selected" class to the current active filter link based on the `currentFilter` state from Redux.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist
  
  The `FooterComponent` conditionally renders a "Clear completed" button when `completedTodoCount > 0`, ensuring it only appears when completed todos exist.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter
  
  The `HeaderComponent` has input handling logic that dispatches the `addTodo` action when Enter is pressed on the new todo input field.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos
  
  The `TodoItemComponent` includes a checkbox that dispatches the `toggleTodo` action when clicked, which toggles the completion status of the todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once
  
  The `TodoListComponent` includes a toggle-all checkbox that dispatches the `toggleAllTodos` action when clicked, affecting all todos at once.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management
  
  The `TodoItemComponent` handles editing with proper focus management using the `useEffect` hook and a ref to the input field. When entering edit mode, the component focuses the input and positions the cursor at the end of the text.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos
  
  The `TodoItemComponent` includes a delete button that dispatches the `deleteTodo` action when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos
  
  The `FooterComponent` includes a "Clear completed" button that dispatches the `clearCompletedTodos` action when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status
  
  The application uses selectors in `todosSlice.ts` to filter todos based on the current filter state. The `selectFilteredTodos` selector returns different subsets of todos depending on whether the filter is "all", "active", or "completed".
