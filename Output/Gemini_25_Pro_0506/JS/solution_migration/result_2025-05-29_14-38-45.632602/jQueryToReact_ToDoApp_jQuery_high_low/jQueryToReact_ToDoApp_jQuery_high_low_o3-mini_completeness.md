- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos  
  The TodoListComponent uses a <main> element with an input checkbox (id "toggle-all") and renders a list of todos in a <ul id="todo-list">.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button  
  Each TodoItemComponent includes a checkbox (class "toggle"), a label displaying the todo’s title, and a button (class "destroy") for deletion.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode  
  In TodoItemComponent, a double-click on the label triggers editing mode (via onDoubleClick), which then renders an input field for editing the todo’s title.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The App component and FooterComponent implement routing and display filter links for "All", "Active", and "Completed" todos, ensuring proper filtering functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization  
  The FooterComponent uses the pluralize utility function to correctly show "item" or "items" based on the count of active todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter  
  The FooterComponent applies the "selected" class conditionally to filter links based on the current filter state from Redux.
