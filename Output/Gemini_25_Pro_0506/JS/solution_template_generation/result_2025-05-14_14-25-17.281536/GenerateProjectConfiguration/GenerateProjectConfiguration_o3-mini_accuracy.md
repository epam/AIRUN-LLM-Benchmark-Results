# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Vite is configured as the build tool with appropriate configuration files  
  The project includes a dedicated vite.config.ts file configured with the React plugin, server, build options, and proper alias resolution.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm TypeScript is properly configured with a tsconfig.json file containing correct compiler options  
  The tsconfig.json file specifies modern ECMAScript targets, strict type-checking, and proper paths and module resolutions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the React setup includes necessary entry points and proper component structure  
  The inclusion of index.html, main.tsx, and a well-organized folder structure (src, pages, components) confirms a correct React setup.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that Redux is implemented with appropriate store configuration, reducers, and actions  
  Redux Toolkit is used with a configured store (store.ts), slice definitions (counterSlice.ts), and hooks (hooks.ts) for accessing state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify React Router is correctly configured with defined routes and navigation components  
  The router.tsx file defines the routes, and the App.tsx component includes navigation links and an Outlet for nested routes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure testing libraries are properly configured with appropriate test setup files  
  The project includes Vitest and Testing Library configurations, along with a setupTests.ts file and multiple test files for components and slices.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate package.json includes correct dependencies with compatible version specifications  
  The package.json file lists dependencies and devDependencies such as React, Redux Toolkit, TypeScript, and testing libraries with proper and current version ranges.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm package.json contains scripts for development, building, and testing operations  
  The provided scripts (dev, build, preview, test, lint, format, etc.) ensure that the project supports modern development workflows.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the project structure follows modern React development conventions  
  The project is well-organized into folders like src/app, src/components, src/features, and src/pages, adhering to current best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that configuration files are production-ready with appropriate optimization settings  
  The configuration files (vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json, etc.) are set up with production optimizations such as sourcemap generation, module resolution, and bundler settings, making the project ready for production deployment.
