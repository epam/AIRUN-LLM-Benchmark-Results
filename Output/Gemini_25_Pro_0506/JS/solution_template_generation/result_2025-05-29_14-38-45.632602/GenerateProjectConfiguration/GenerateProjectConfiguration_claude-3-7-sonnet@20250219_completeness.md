  Each command includes an explanation of its purpose and usage examples.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that package.json includes all necessary dependencies for the required technologies
  
  The `package.json` file includes all necessary dependencies:
  - Vite: `vite` and `@vitejs/plugin-react`
  - React: `react` and `react-dom`
  - TypeScript: `typescript` and related type definitions
  - Redux: `@reduxjs/toolkit` and `react-redux`
  - React Router: `react-router-dom`
  - Testing: `vitest`, `@testing-library/react`, etc.
  - Linting and formatting: `eslint`, `prettier`, and related plugins

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the project contains complete configuration files without placeholder comments or TODOs
  
  All configuration files are complete and properly implemented:
  - `.eslintrc.cjs` - Complete ESLint configuration
  - `.prettierrc.json` - Complete Prettier configuration
  - `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.node.json` - Complete TypeScript configurations
  - `vite.config.ts` - Complete Vite configuration
  
  No placeholder comments or TODOs are present in any configuration files.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the presence of proper TypeScript type definitions throughout the project
  
  TypeScript type definitions are properly implemented throughout the project:
  - Type interfaces for component props (e.g., `ExampleComponentProps`)
  - Redux state types (`CounterState`, `RootState`, `AppDispatch`)
  - Custom hooks with proper typing (`useAppDispatch`, `useAppSelector`)
  - Proper type annotations for function parameters and return values

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure testing library configuration is complete with necessary setup files
  
  The testing configuration is complete:
  - `setupTests.ts` is present with necessary imports
  - Vitest is configured in `vite.config.ts` with proper options
  - Testing utilities and helper functions are implemented
  - Test examples are provided for components and Redux functionality

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the project structure includes directories for components, state management, and routing
  
  The project structure is well-organized with dedicated directories:
  - `src/components` - For reusable UI components
  - `src/features` - For feature-specific modules with Redux slices
  - `src/pages` - For page components
  - `src/app` - For Redux store configuration and hooks
  - Routing is configured in `src/router.tsx`

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the entry point files for the application are properly defined
  
  Entry point files are properly defined:
  - `index.html` - Main HTML file
  - `src/main.tsx` - React entry point that renders the app
  - `src/App.tsx` - Root component with routing configuration
  - `src/router.tsx` - Router configuration

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all configuration follows established best practices for each technology
  
  The configurations follow established best practices:
  - ESLint configuration includes recommended plugins for React, TypeScript, and accessibility
  - TypeScript configuration is strict with appropriate module resolution
  - Redux is implemented using Redux Toolkit with proper store setup
  - React Router uses the new createBrowserRouter API
  - Vite configuration includes proper path aliases and test setup

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that build and environment configuration supports production deployment
  
  The build and environment configuration supports production deployment:
  - `vite.config.ts` includes build options for production
  - `.gitignore` excludes build artifacts and environment files
  - `package.json` includes proper build scripts
  - Environment type definitions in `src/vite-env.d.ts`
  - Path aliases are configured for improved imports
