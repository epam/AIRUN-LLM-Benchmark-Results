# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Vite is configured as the build tool with appropriate configuration files  
  The project includes a dedicated vite.config.ts file with a proper configuration for development and production builds, including plugins, server settings, and alias configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm TypeScript is properly configured with a tsconfig.json file containing correct compiler options  
  The project contains both tsconfig.json and tsconfig.node.json files. The compiler options (including module resolution, strict mode, paths alias) are set appropriately for a modern TypeScript + React project.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the React setup includes necessary entry points and proper component structure  
  The entry point main.tsx, along with the index.html, App.tsx, and router.tsx files, clearly establish the React setup. The component structure (pages, components, features) is well organized.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that Redux is implemented with appropriate store configuration, reducers, and actions  
  Redux is implemented using Redux Toolkit. There is a store configuration in src/app/store.ts, and the counter feature includes a slice with reducers and actions. The Redux Provider is correctly set up in the main entry point.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify React Router is correctly configured with defined routes and navigation components  
  The router.tsx file uses createBrowserRouter to define routes, and the App component includes navigation links for these routes. The configuration directs unknown routes to the home page.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure testing libraries are properly configured with appropriate test setup files  
  The project uses Vitest and React Testing Library. A setupTests.ts file is present for test environment configuration, and several test suites are provided for components and reducers.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate package.json includes correct dependencies with compatible version specifications  
  The package.json file lists well-known and compatible dependencies, including React 18, Redux Toolkit, React Router, and supporting libraries for testing, linting, and formatting.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm package.json contains scripts for development, building, and testing operations  
  All necessary scripts for development (npm run dev), building (npm run build), previewing (npm run preview), testing (npm run test, npm run test:ui), linting (npm run lint), and formatting (npm run format) are included.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the project structure follows modern React development conventions  
  The file organization separates public assets from source code, and categorizes code into app, components, features, and pages, which follows current best practices for React projects.

- **Pass** (95%): Check that configuration files are production-ready with appropriate optimization settings  
  The Vite configuration includes production settings such as output directory and sourcemaps. While sourcemaps are enabled (which is helpful for debugging but may be optional in production environments), the overall configuration appears production-ready.  
  (Slight uncertainty stems from production optimization flags typically being adjusted per deployment needs, but the existing setup is adequate for a starter project.)
