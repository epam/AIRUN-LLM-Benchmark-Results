# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist

    The test suite includes a dedicated "Component Rendering" section with tests for rendering with default props, checking that the combobox and placeholder are present.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present

    The test suite has a comprehensive "Keyboard Navigation" section testing Escape, Enter, ArrowUp/ArrowDown, Home, End, PageUp, PageDown, Backspace, and Tab keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)

    Tests for clicking on control, dropdown indicator, clear indicator, and options are present in the "User Interactions" section.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior

    Tests verify both controlled behavior (through props like `value` and `inputValue`) and uncontrolled behavior with internal state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values

    Tests cover state changes for selecting options, removing values in multi-select, and clearing values via the clear indicator.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented

    Tests verify menu opens on control click, closes on Escape key, and responds to dropdown indicator clicks.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality

    The "Menu and Options" section includes tests for filtering options based on input and displaying the noOptionsMessage when filtering yields no results.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist

    Dedicated tests for multi-select behavior cover adding options, removing options, and the hideSelectedOptions functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility

    The "Accessibility (ARIA)" section tests aria-label, aria-expanded, aria-haspopup, aria-controls, aria-activedescendant, and aria-selected attributes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested

    The "Edge Cases" section tests handling of empty options arrays.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states

    Tests verify the loadingMessage is displayed when isLoading is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states

    Tests confirm disabled options cannot be selected and that the component can be disabled while focused.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance

    While direct performance testing isn't implemented (as noted), the test suite uses a large option array (12 items) for keyboard navigation testing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested

    Tests verify autoFocus behavior, blurring after selection, and focus handling when the component becomes disabled.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering

    Tests check placeholder rendering and value display including controlShouldRenderValue behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations

    A dedicated test verifies formatOptionLabel is called correctly for both menu and value contexts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)

    All callback functions are mocked in getProps and verified in various test cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)

    Tests verify dropdown indicator toggles menu, clear indicator removes value, and loading indicator displays when isLoading is true.
