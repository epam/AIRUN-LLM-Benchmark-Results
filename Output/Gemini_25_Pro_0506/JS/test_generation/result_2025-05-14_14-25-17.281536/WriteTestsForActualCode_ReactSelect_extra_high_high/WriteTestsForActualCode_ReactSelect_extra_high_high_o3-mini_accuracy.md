# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up  
  The test file imports Jest and the React Testing Library modules (render, screen, fireEvent, waitFor, etc.) and sets up the testing environment appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test cases are properly isolated and do not have interdependencies  
  Each test case is organized within its own describe/it block and mocks are reset using beforeEach, ensuring isolation between tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that DOM events are simulated using proper React Testing Library methods  
  The tests make extensive use of userEvent and fireEvent from React Testing Library to correctly simulate user interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that accessibility attributes are being tested appropriately  
  Tests check for proper ARIA attributes (e.g., aria-expanded, aria-controls, aria-activedescendant, aria-selected) ensuring accessibility is properly validated.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure mocks are used for external dependencies where appropriate  
  The file uses jest.mock to override external modules (utilities, accessibility helpers, MenuPlacer, and ScrollManager), keeping tests focused on component logic.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify proper use of async/await for asynchronous testing where needed  
  Asynchronous actions (typing, clicking, waiting for DOM updates) are handled with async/await and waitFor. While the majority of async interactions are covered, minor complexities in async flows might require extra attention in real-world scenarios.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all assertions use appropriate Jest matchers  
  The tests use matchers like toBeInTheDocument, toHaveAttribute, toHaveBeenCalledWith, and toHaveStyle, which are appropriate for the assertions made.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that tests include proper cleanup after each test case  
  Mocks are reset using beforeEach and afterEach sections. Although jest.restoreAllMocks is commented out in some parts, the manual reset steps appear sufficient for cleanup in this test file.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test descriptions clearly indicate what functionality is being tested  
  Each test case includes descriptive messages (e.g., "should render with default props", "should call onFocus and onBlur handlers", "should update aria-activedescendant on keyboard navigation") that clearly state its purpose.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the test file follows best practices for organizing test cases (describe/it blocks)  
  Tests are well-organized in nested describe and it blocks, grouping tests by functionality such as rendering, user interactions, state management, accessibility, and edge cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that all event handlers are tested using appropriate simulation methods  
  The tests correctly simulate events (clicks, focus, blur, key presses) to verify that event handlers like onChange, onFocus, onBlur, onMenuOpen, and onMenuClose are invoked as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the test environment correctly simulates both mouse and keyboard interactions  
  Mouse events are simulated via userEvent.click and keyboard interactions using userEvent.type (with keys like {arrowdown}, {escape}, {enter}, etc.), adequately covering both types of interactions.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure tests for touch events properly simulate mobile interactions  
  The file mocks functions like isTouchCapable and uses them to simulate touch behavior in tests (e.g., blurInputOnSelect). While the simulation covers expected behavior, real touch event simulation in JSDOM is inherently limited, affecting full confidence.
