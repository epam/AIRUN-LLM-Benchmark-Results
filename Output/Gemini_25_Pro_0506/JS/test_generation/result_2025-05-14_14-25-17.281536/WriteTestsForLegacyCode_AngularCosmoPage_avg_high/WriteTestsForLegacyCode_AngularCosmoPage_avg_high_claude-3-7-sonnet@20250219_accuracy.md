# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)
  
  The tests explicitly use Jasmine as the testing framework with Karma as the test runner. This is evident from the karma.conf.js configuration which specifically sets `frameworks: ['jasmine']` and includes all the necessary setup for running Jasmine tests with Karma.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints
  
  The tests properly mock $resource service throughout the test suite. In particular, the `rest.factory.spec.js` file includes comprehensive testing of all API endpoints with proper mocking. The tests create spy objects for each REST method (save, update, query, delete) and configure them with fake implementations using `jasmine.createSpy().and.callFake()`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation
  
  All test files properly use `beforeEach` hooks to set up the test environment, including module loading, dependency injection, and mock setup. The `rest.factory.spec.js` also uses `afterEach` hooks to verify no outstanding HTTP expectations or requests remain, ensuring proper cleanup after tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls
  
  HTTP requests are properly mocked using `$httpBackend` in the REST factory tests, ensuring no real API calls are made. The implementation correctly uses `$httpBackend.expectGET()`, `$httpBackend.flush()`, and similar methods to simulate and verify HTTP responses.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection
  
  The tests properly inject dependencies using AngularJS's dependency injection system. This is shown in constructs like:
  ```javascript
  beforeEach(inject(function(_REST_, _$httpBackend_, _$resource_) {
      REST = _REST_;
      $httpBackend = _$httpBackend_;
      $resource = _$resource_;
  }));
  ```
  
  And also through module configuration with `$provide`:
  ```javascript
  module(function($provide) {
      $provide.value('Page', mockPage);
      $provide.value('Users', mockUsers);
      // etc.
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations
  
  The test suite properly handles promises and asynchronous operations. It uses `$q` for creating and resolving promises, calls `$rootScope.$digest()` to resolve promises in the digest cycle, and properly tests both success and error callback paths in promise chains.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies
  
  The tests extensively use spies and mocks for external dependencies. This includes using `jasmine.createSpy()` for functions, spying on methods with `spyOn()`, and providing mock implementations with `.and.callFake()`. The tests mock REST services, $translate, $location, localStorage, and other dependencies effectively.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization
  
  All tests follow the describe/it pattern, with clear hierarchical organization. For example:
  ```javascript
  describe('Controller: pageCtrl', function() {
    // Main controller describe block
    
    describe('Initialization', function() {
      // Sub-group for initialization tests
      it('should initialize $scope.page from Page factory', function() {
        // Individual test case
      });
      // More test cases...
    });
    
    describe('Page Deletion', function() {
      // Another sub-group
      // Test cases...
    });
    // More sub-groups...
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls
  
  The tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls. For example, in the `pageCtrl.controller.spec.js`, there are specific tests for handling REST call failures:
  ```javascript
  it('should handle error during REST.content.save', function() {
    mockREST.content.save.and.callFake(function(payload, successCb, errorCb) {
      errorCb({});
    });
    $scope.savePage();
    $rootScope.$digest();
    expect($rootScope.$broadcast).toHaveBeenCalledWith('notify', { message: 'page_error_saving', classes: 'alert-error' });
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate
  
  The tests simulate user interactions by directly calling controller methods that would be triggered by user actions, such as `$scope.titleChange()`, `$scope.selectSuggestion()`, `$scope.savePage()`, and `$scope.deletePage()`, and then verifying the expected outcomes.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage
  
  The tests properly clean up after execution using `afterEach` hooks. This includes verifying no outstanding HTTP expectations with `$httpBackend.verifyNoOutstandingExpectation()` and uninstalling the mocked clock with `jasmine.clock().uninstall()`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested
  
  The tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested. For example:
  ```javascript
  it('should initialize $scope.page from Page factory', function() {...});
  it('localVersion() should restore Page properties from localStorage and clear them', function() {...});
  it('should set newerVersion to true if localStorage has different values', function() {...});
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible
  
  The tests primarily validate function outputs and side effects rather than implementation details. They focus on what the code does rather than how it does it, by checking:
  - Updated state after function calls
  - Proper interaction with dependencies through spy expectations
  - Correct responses to different inputs
  - Error handling behavior
