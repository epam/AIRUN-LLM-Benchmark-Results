# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources

    The provided code includes comprehensive tests for the REST factory in `test/specs/services/rest.factory.spec.js` that cover all 16 defined resources (blocks, blocksRequirements, comments, content, contentExtras, contentRevisions, contentRevisionsExtras, contentTags, files, filesTags, menus, modules, sitemaps, themes, settings, users). Each resource is tested with a dedicated test case using the `testResource` helper function to verify URL patterns, parameters, and custom methods like update.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly

    In `test/specs/services/page.factory.spec.js`, tests validate that the Page factory is defined and all its initial properties have the correct values. The test specifically checks id, title, description, header, subheader, body, url, type, published, published_date, themePages, timestamp, extras, and misc properties.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly

    The tests in `test/specs/services/users.factory.spec.js` verify that the Users factory is defined and properly initializes all its properties (id, username, name, bio, email, facebook, twitter, photo, role) with the expected default values.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods

    The tests for the pageCtrl controller in `test/specs/controllers/pageCtrl.controller.spec.js` are comprehensive, covering all public methods including titleChange(), descriptionChange(), urlChange(), updatePageType(), deletePage(), savePage(), autocompleteTags(), selectSuggestion(), localVersion(), deleteNewerVersion(), and saveLocal().

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller

    The `Initialization` describe block in the pageCtrl tests contains specific test cases that verify the controller correctly initializes $scope.page, handles scheduleDate initialization based on Page.scheduleDate, initializes page type from Page.type or themePages, and sets newerVersion based on localStorage comparisons.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation

    The pageCtrl tests include specific test cases for the titleChange() function that verify it updates the Page.title and correctly auto-generates a URL for new pages, converting spaces to dashes and lowercasing the title. It also verifies that URL auto-generation doesn't occur when autoURL is false or for existing pages.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction

    The tests verify that the saveLocal() function correctly updates the Page factory properties and correspondingly saves them to localStorage using the appropriate keys based on $routeParams.url prefix.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality

    The tests in the `Tag Autocomplete` describe block verify that autocompleteTags() correctly queries REST.contentTags with the appropriate tag parameter, updates $scope.page.suggestions with the response, and handles edge cases like empty tags or query failures.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)

    The savePage() function tests are exhaustive, with separate describe blocks for new pages and updates. Tests verify validation logic, handling of duplicate URLs, page creation flow, update flow, tag saving/deletion, extras handling, and both success and error callbacks from REST operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types

    The tests include specific validations for edge cases in the savePage() function, including showing appropriate errors for empty URLs, URLs set to "new", and empty page types. The tests also cover the fallback behavior of using Page.header when $scope.page.title is empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly

    The tests for the deletePage() function verify that it calls all relevant REST delete methods (content, contentRevisions, contentRevisionsExtras, contentExtras, contentTags) with the correct parameters, broadcasts a notification upon success, and redirects to the correct path.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions

    The `Local Version Management` describe block includes tests for localVersion() and deleteNewerVersion() functions that verify proper retrieval of data from localStorage, updating Page properties, clearing localStorage entries, and toggling the newerVersion flag.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components

    While the tests appear comprehensive and should provide good coverage, the actual coverage percentage isn't explicitly stated in the code. However, the test suite is set up with coverage reporting (in karma.conf.js) and the tests thoroughly cover various components, edge cases, and branches, which strongly suggests coverage would exceed 80%. Based on the depth and breadth of the tests, it's reasonable to conclude they would achieve high coverage.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling

    The tests properly spy on $rootScope.$broadcast and verify that appropriate events ('contentGet', 'settingsGet', 'notify') are broadcast with the correct parameters. Tests also verify that controller functions respond to events, such as updating $scope.page when 'contentGet' is broadcast.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality

    The tests thoroughly validate the date handling in savePage(), including setting scheduleDate to now when publishing immediately, keeping original scheduleDate for already-published pages, parsing scheduleDate for scheduled publishing, and handling the case where a scheduled date is in the past.
