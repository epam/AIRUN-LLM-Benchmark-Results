# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)  
  The tests are configured using Karma and written with Jasmine, which are modern and widely used tools in the AngularJS ecosystem.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints  
  The tests for the REST factory make use of a helper function to verify that resources provide the expected methods (get, query, save, delete, update) and properly handle parameterized URLs. The use of $httpBackend further confirms that HTTP requests are simulated correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation  
  The test files consistently use beforeEach to set up module dependencies, instantiate controllers or services, and afterEach (especially in the REST tests) to verify no outstanding HTTP requests remain, ensuring isolation between individual tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls  
  The use of $httpBackend.expectGET, $httpBackend.flush, and verification functions ensures that no actual HTTP calls are made during testing.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection  
  Dependencies such as $scope, $rootScope, $controller, $location, $routeParams, $q, and others are correctly injected using AngularJSâ€™s dependency injection mechanism.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations  
  The tests make appropriate use of $rootScope.$digest() calls to resolve promises (e.g., with $translate) and simulate asynchronous REST operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies  
  The code employs jasmine.createSpy, spyOn, and callFake to create mocks and spies for external dependencies (such as REST services, localStorage, and $location) ensuring that external interactions are fully controlled and observed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization  
  Test cases are structured using describe blocks grouped by functionality and it blocks for individual test scenarios, thus providing clear and logical organization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls  
  The tests simulate both successful REST calls (by invoking success callbacks) and failure cases (by triggering error callbacks) to ensure robust validation of the application's behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate  
  The controller tests simulate user interactions by changing scope variables (for example, testing titleChange, urlChange, and other methods) which closely replicate actual user input and behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage  
  The tests employ afterEach hooks (e.g., verifying $httpBackend has no outstanding requests and uninstalling jasmine.clock) to avoid interference between tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested  
  The names used in describe and it blocks are descriptive and clearly convey the purpose and expected outcomes of each test.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible  
  The tests focus on validating the external behavior and outputs (such as notifying via $rootScope broadcasts and updating the $scope model) rather than relying overly on internal implementation details.
