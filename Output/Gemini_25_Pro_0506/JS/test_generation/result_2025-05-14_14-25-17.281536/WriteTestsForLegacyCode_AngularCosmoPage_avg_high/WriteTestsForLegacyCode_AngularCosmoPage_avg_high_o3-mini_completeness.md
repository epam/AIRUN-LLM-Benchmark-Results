# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources  
  The tests in "rest.factory.spec.js" include a helper function (testResource) that is invoked for every resource (e.g., blocks, blocksRequirements, comments, content, contentExtras, contentRevisions, contentRevisionsExtras, contentTags, files, filesTags, menus, modules, sitemaps, themes, settings, and users), ensuring that each resource is properly tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly  
  The "page.factory.spec.js" file explicitly checks that each property (id, title, description, header, subheader, body, url, type, published, published_date, themePages, timestamp, extras, and misc) starts with the expected initial values.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly  
  The "users.factory.spec.js" contains tests that verify the initial state of properties such as id, username, name, bio, email, facebook, twitter, photo, and role.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods  
  The "pageCtrl.controller.spec.js" file extensively tests various functionalities of the controller including initialization, local version management, deletion, property changes (title, description, URL), tag autocomplete, and save/update flows.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller  
  Tests clearly verify the initialization of $scope.page from the Page factory, handling of scheduleDate, determination of page type, and flagging of newerVersion based on localStorage state and the current URL.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation  
  There are dedicated tests for the titleChange method that check for correct auto-generation of the URL when creating a new page and validate that the URL remains unchanged when autoURL is disabled or for existing pages.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction  
  The tests for saveLocal ensure that Page properties are updated correctly and that localStorage.setItem is called appropriately with updated values.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality  
  The tests for autocompleteTags cover both successful responses (populating suggestions) and error cases where suggestions are cleared if no tag is provided or if the query fails.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)  
  Test blocks for the savePage method thoroughly cover different flows including duplicate URL checks, missing page type or URL errors, new page creation (using content.save and subsequent promises), and update flows (with content.update and tag/extra handling).

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types  
  The tests correctly trigger notifications and error handling when the page type or URL is empty (or set to "new"), ensuring that these scenarios are handled correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly  
  The deletePage method is confirmed to invoke all necessary REST service calls (for content, revisions, extras, tags, etc.) and correctly broadcasts notifications and redirects the user.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions  
  Tests for localVersion and deleteNewerVersion verify that the controller syncs data from localStorage into the Page factory correctly and that localStorage items are cleared as expected.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components  
  The tests are comprehensive and cover most branches, including success and error scenarios across factories and controller methods. Although full coverage statistics are not available here, the extensive test cases suggest a strong likelihood of achieving at least 80% coverage. (Slight uncertainty due to potential untested minor branches in complex promise chains.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling  
  The tests consistently check for the correct broadcasting of notifications (using $rootScope.$broadcast) and the handling of events like 'contentGet' and 'notify', ensuring expected controller behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality  
  There are tests verifying that scheduleDate is set correctly for new pages, that it defaults to the current date when not set, and that published_date is correctly calculated (with proper timestamp conversion) for both immediate and scheduled publishing scenarios.
