  The app.test.tsx file contains tests such as "renders header and new todo input," confirming the component is rendered as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos  
  The test "adds a new todo when Enter is pressed in the input field with text" demonstrates that adding new todos is properly covered.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos  
  Tests invoking router changes (using triggerRoute) and verifying the number of items displayed confirm that filtering is tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The test "calls model.clearCompleted when 'Clear completed' button is clicked" validates the clear completed functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering  
  The todoItem.test.tsx file includes tests in the "View Mode" section that check for proper rendering of the todo title, checkbox, and item classes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos  
  Tests cover toggling of the checkbox, the destroy button functionality, and editing mode (through double-click) ensuring these functionalities are adequately verified.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events  
  The tests simulate key events for Enter, Escape, and blur events to confirm that keyboard interactions—such as saving, canceling, or destroying a todo—are handled.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts  
  Multiple tests for 0, 1, and multiple active items ensure that the footer renders the correct pluralization and count text.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation  
  Tests validating the className of filter links based on the currently selected filter confirm proper filter navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The test that checks for the display of a "Clear completed" button and one that verifies the button’s click behavior confirm this feature.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos  
  The provided tests in todoModel.test.ts cover addTodo, toggle, save, and destroy, ensuring all major functionalities are validated.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions  
  Tests for "inform should call all subscribed onChange callbacks" and subscription behavior confirm that the subscription logic is validated.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The "clearCompleted" test verifies that completing todos are appropriately cleared and that subscribers are informed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation  
  The "uuid" test suite includes checks for type, uniqueness, and UUID format.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality  
  Tests confirming both singular and plural word outputs ensure that pluralize is properly tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations  
  Various scenarios (storing data, retrieving data, handling invalid JSON, and returning an empty array when applicable) are well covered.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function  
  The tests for extending objects—with merging, handling empty objects, and ensuring immutability—confirm that the extend function is thoroughly verified.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx  
  All test files follow an appropriate naming convention (e.g., app.test.tsx, todoItem.test.tsx, footer.test.tsx). Although some tests are named with a .test.ts extension (e.g., utils.test.ts, todoModel.test.ts), this is a common and acceptable variation within many projects.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data  
  The tests define sample todo data across multiple test files (for example, in todoItem.test.tsx and app.test.tsx), confirming that fixtures are correctly established.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented  
  Mocks for the global Router are set up in setupTests.ts, and tests in app.test.tsx simulate route changes using triggerRoute, adequately verifying the routing functionality.
