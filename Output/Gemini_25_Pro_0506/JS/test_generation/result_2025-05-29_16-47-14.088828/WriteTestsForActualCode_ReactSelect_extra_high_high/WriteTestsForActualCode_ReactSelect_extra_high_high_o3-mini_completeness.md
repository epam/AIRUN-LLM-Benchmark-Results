# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist  
  The test suite includes a "Component Rendering" section with tests such as rendering with default props and checking for the presence of the combobox.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present  
  The "User Interactions: Keyboard" section verifies behavior for arrow keys, Tab, Enter, and Escape.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)  
  Mouse and touch interactions are covered in the "User Interactions: Mouse/Touch" section with tests for clicking the control, dropdown indicator, and clear indicator.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior  
  The tests verify both controlled input updates (inputValue and value updates) and interactions that change state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values  
  There are tests for selecting an option, removing a value via Backspace in multi-select, and clearing values (via Escape).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented  
  Multiple tests check that the menu opens (on click, focus, arrow keys) and closes (Escape, second click, scroll).

- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality  
  The suite tests filtering (typing an input) and displays appropriate messages (e.g., "No items found") when no options match.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist  
  There are dedicated tests for multi-select mode such as rendering multiple values and handling removal of values.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility  
  The "Accessibility (ARIA attributes)" section checks attributes such as aria-label, aria-expanded, aria-activedescendant, and others.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested  
  A test case for "handles empty options array" demonstrates proper handling of an empty options prop.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states  
  While there is a test verifying the loadingMessage when isLoading is true, there is no explicit test covering error states.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states  
  The tests confirm that options marked as disabled receive the correct styling and do not trigger a selection.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance  
  Although the suite mentions performance considerations and suggests that tests for large option sets are important, no explicit test for performance with large datasets is provided. This might be intentional as performance testing is often addressed separately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested  
  Tests verify focus state transitions (onFocus/onBlur) and the application of focus-related classes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering  
  There are multiple tests checking that the placeholder is rendered when no value is present and that selected values are displayed correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations  
  A test ensures that the custom formatOptionLabel function is invoked and renders the expected formatted output for both menu and value contexts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)  
  Callback functions have dedicated tests to ensure they are invoked with the proper arguments during interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)  
  The test suite includes tests for user interactions with the DropdownIndicator and ClearIndicator, and a loadingMessage test indirectly covers loading indicator behavior.
