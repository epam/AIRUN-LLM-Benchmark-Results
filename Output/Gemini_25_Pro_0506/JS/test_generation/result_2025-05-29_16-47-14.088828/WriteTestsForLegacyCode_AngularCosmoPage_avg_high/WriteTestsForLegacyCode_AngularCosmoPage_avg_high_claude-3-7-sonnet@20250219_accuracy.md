# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)
  
  The tests clearly use Jasmine as the testing framework and Karma as the test runner, which are appropriate choices for AngularJS applications. This is evidenced by the use of Jasmine's `describe`, `it`, `beforeEach`, `afterEach`, `expect`, and spy functions, as well as the detailed Karma configuration file (`karma.conf.js`).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints
  
  The tests create a sophisticated mock for `$resource` that returns spy objects with methods like `get`, `query`, `save`, `delete`, and `update`. Each method is configured to return a promise that can be controlled in the tests. The mocks properly handle the various REST API endpoints used by the application, including those for pages, content, tags, revisions, and extras.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation
  
  Throughout the test suite, `beforeEach` hooks are used extensively to set up the testing environment before each test, including mocking dependencies, creating a fresh scope, and initializing the controller. `afterEach` hooks are also used where appropriate, such as for cleaning up localStorage and uninstalling the jasmine clock.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls
  
  All HTTP requests are properly mocked by mocking the `$resource` service rather than making real API calls. The mock returns spy objects that track calls and allow the tests to resolve or reject promises as needed. This ensures that no real API calls are made during testing.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection
  
  The tests properly use AngularJS dependency injection through both the `inject` function and `$provide`. Dependencies like `$controller`, `$rootScope`, `$location`, and `$q` are injected using the `inject` function, while services like `Page`, `REST`, `Users`, and `$translate` are mocked and provided using `$provide.value()` or `$provide.factory()`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations
  
  The tests demonstrate thorough handling of promises and asynchronous operations. They use `$q.defer()` to create deferred objects that control the resolution or rejection of promises. They also consistently call `$rootScope.$digest()` after resolving or rejecting promises to trigger AngularJS's digest cycle and allow promise callbacks to execute.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies
  
  The tests make extensive use of Jasmine spies to track calls to methods and verify interactions. They spy on methods like `$location.path()` and `$rootScope.$broadcast()` to verify redirects and notifications. They also create sophisticated mocks for services like `REST`, `Page`, `Users`, and `localStorage`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization
  
  The tests are well-organized using nested `describe` blocks for different components and functionality, with `it` blocks for individual test cases. The structure provides a clear hierarchy that groups related tests together, making the test suite easy to navigate and understand.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls
  
  The tests thoroughly cover both success and error scenarios for API calls. For example, in the `savePage()` tests, they verify the behavior when REST operations succeed and when they fail, testing the appropriate error messages and notifications in each case.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate
  
  The tests simulate user interactions by directly calling controller methods that would be triggered by user actions, such as `titleChange()`, `urlChange()`, `updatePageType()`, `selectSuggestion()`, and `savePage()`. They also set up the necessary state before calling these methods to accurately simulate the user's context.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage
  
  The tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage. They use `afterEach` hooks to clear localStorage and uninstall the Jasmine clock. They also create fresh instances of objects for each test using `beforeEach` hooks.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested
  
  The tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested. The `describe` and `it` blocks have names that form readable sentences describing the component or behavior being tested, such as "should initialize $scope.page with values from Page factory" and "should update Page.title and broadcast settingsGet".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible
  
  The tests validate function outputs and side effects rather than implementation details where possible. They verify the values of `$scope` properties, check that the correct arguments are passed to service methods, and confirm that the appropriate notifications are broadcast and redirects occur. They focus on the observable behavior of the code rather than the specific implementation.
