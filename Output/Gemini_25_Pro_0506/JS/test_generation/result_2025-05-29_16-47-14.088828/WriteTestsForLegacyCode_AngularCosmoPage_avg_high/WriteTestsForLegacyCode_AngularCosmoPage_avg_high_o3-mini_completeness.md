# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources  
  The provided "rest.factory.spec.js" file tests all the expected resource endpoints (e.g., blocks, comments, content, menus, users, etc.) by checking that REST[resource] is defined and verifying that the mocked $resource is called with correct parameters.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly  
  The "page.factory.spec.js" file confirms that all expected properties (id, title, description, header, subheader, body, url, type, published, published_date, themePages, timestamp, extras, misc) are initialized with the correct default values.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly  
  The "users.factory.spec.js" confirms the Users factory initializes every required property (id, username, name, bio, email, facebook, twitter, photo, role) with appropriate default values.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods  
  The "pageCtrl.controller.spec.js" file contains extensive tests for public methods including initialization, localVersion management, deletePage, updatePage, updatePageType, titleChange, descriptionChange, urlChange, saveLocal, autocompleteTags, selectSuggestion, and savePage. This ensures broad coverage of the controller functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller  
  Multiple test cases are included to verify that the controller properly initializes scope variables from the Page factory and handles scheduleDate adjustments based on the route (e.g., /new versus other paths).

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation  
  The tests for titleChange check that, when conditions are met (such as an empty or "new" URL), the URL gets auto-generated correctly from the title and that the autoURL flag is updated accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction  
  The test cases not only check that Page properties are updated but also verify that localStorage is used appropriately (saving values and being cleared when needed) via the localVersion and saveLocal tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality  
  The autocompleteTags tests simulate the query on REST.contentTags and verify that, upon promise resolution or rejection, the scope’s suggestions are updated (or cleared) as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)  
  The savePage tests address various scenarios: duplicate page prevention, error conditions (e.g., empty URL/type), new page creation (with revisions and extras), and update scenarios. This ensures that most conditional branches are exercised.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types  
  The tests check that appropriate error notifications are broadcast when empty URLs or missing page types are encountered, which addresses these edge cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly  
  There is a dedicated test for deletePage() that confirms the proper REST service calls are made and that after a successful deletion, proper notifications are broadcast and redirection occurs.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions  
  The suite includes tests for checking "newerVersion" based on differences between Page factory values and localStorage values, as well as tests for the localVersion() function managing restoration and clearance of localStorage data.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components  
  Although code coverage is not directly calculated in this report, the comprehensive nature of the tests for each component is expected to meet and likely exceed 80% coverage. A slight uncertainty (10%) remains since actual coverage data isn’t provided, but based on the extensive tests, the target is likely met.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling  
  The tests make effective use of spies to verify that events (using $broadcast) are correctly triggered (e.g., 'notify', 'contentGet', and 'settingsGet') in response to controller actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality  
  The tests use jasmine.clock() and mockDate to simulate current time scenarios and verify that scheduleDate is correctly adjusted, depending on whether the page is new, published, scheduled for a past date, or scheduled for a future date.
