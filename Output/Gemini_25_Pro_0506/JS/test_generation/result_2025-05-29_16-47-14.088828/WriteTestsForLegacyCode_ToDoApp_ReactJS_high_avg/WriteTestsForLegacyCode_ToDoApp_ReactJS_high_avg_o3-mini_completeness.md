# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering  
  The tests in app.test.tsx validate the initial rendering of TodoApp and its UI elements (header, main, footer, and router-driven views).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos  
  The "Todo Creation" section in app.test.tsx contains tests that simulate entering a todo and pressing Enter, verifying that addTodo is called.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos  
  The test for toggling all todos is present and confirms that clicking the "toggle all" checkbox calls toggleAll with the correct values.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos  
  Routing tests in app.test.tsx check that the "nowShowing" state updates correctly and the appropriate todos appear when filtering by Active, Completed, or All.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The TodoApp tests include a section that checks if the "Clear completed" button is visible and calls clearCompleted when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering  
  The todoItem.test.tsx file contains tests that assert correct rendering of the todo item in both view and editing modes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos  
  There are distinct tests in todoItem.test.tsx that simulate toggling the checkbox, clicking the destroy button, and entering editing mode with subsequent text changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events  
  The tests cover keyboard events such as Enter and Escape in editing mode, ensuring onSave, onDestroy, and onCancel are called as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts  
  In footer.test.tsx, tests check for proper display in both singular and plural situations based on the active todo count.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation  
  The footer tests verify that the correct filter links are rendered with the expected href attributes and that the appropriate link receives the "selected" class.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The footer tests ensure that the "Clear completed" button appears when there are completed todos and that clicking it triggers the correct event.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos  
  The todoModel.test.ts file contains tests for addTodo, toggle, save, and destroy methods, confirming proper functionality and state changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions  
  Tests for the subscribe and inform functions are present, confirming that change listeners are added and notified correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The clearCompleted functionality is tested in todoModel.test.ts, ensuring that completed todos are removed and the todos list is updated.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation  
  The utils.test.ts file has multiple tests validating the uuid functionâ€™s string output, uniqueness, proper format, and deterministic behavior when Math.random is mocked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality  
  The tests in utils.test.ts for pluralize validate both singular and plural scenarios accurately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations  
  The test suite confirms that Utils.store properly saves, retrieves, and safely handles invalid or missing JSON data.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function  
  The tests for extend show that merging multiple objects works correctly without side effects on the original objects.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx  
  The component tests (app, todoItem, footer) are named with the ".test.tsx" suffix. For non-React unit tests (todoModel and utils), the ".test.ts" suffix is used, which is standard practice and acceptable.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data  
  Sample todo data and fixtures are defined consistently in the tests (e.g., initialTodos, mockTodo), allowing reproducible test scenarios.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented  
  The global Router mock from setupTests.ts is used in app.test.tsx, and route-triggering functions are tested to simulate navigation, confirming proper routing functionality.
