# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies Angular.js as the framework used
  
  The documentation consistently and correctly identifies AngularJS (1.x) as the framework used throughout the document. It specifically mentions "AngularJS (1.x) Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern" in the Overview section and refers to AngularJS-specific concepts like `$resource`, directives, and services throughout.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all factories (REST, Page, Users) are accurately documented with their purposes
  
  All three factories are thoroughly documented with clear explanations of their purposes:
  - REST factory: "To abstract and centralize API calls, making controllers cleaner and backend interactions consistent"
  - Page factory: "To maintain the state of the page currently being edited"
  - Users factory: "To store information about the currently authenticated user"

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of the Page controller and its functionality is technically accurate
  
  The document provides a detailed and technically accurate description of the `pageCtrl` controller, including its initialization process, core features like saving/updating pages, deletion, local draft management, real-time data binding, and tag autocomplete functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the RESTful API endpoints are correctly documented
  
  Section 3.2 provides a comprehensive table of all RESTful API endpoints including resource names, API endpoint paths, URL parameters, and custom methods. The documentation of these endpoints follows RESTful conventions and appears technically accurate.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of Angular module dependencies ($resource, $location, etc.) is correct
  
  Section 3.1 contains a detailed table of all injected dependencies with accurate descriptions of their types and purposes, including `$scope`, `REST`, `$location`, `$rootScope`, `$routeParams`, `$upload`, `$translate`, and the custom factories.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the page management features (creating, editing, deleting) are accurately described
  
  The documentation provides accurate descriptions of all CRUD operations:
  - Creating: Detailed in the `savePage` function description with the distinction for new pages
  - Editing: Thoroughly explained through the data binding and update mechanisms
  - Deleting: Clearly described in the `deletePage` function explanation, including the confirmation process

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately explains how the local storage mechanism works
  
  The documentation accurately explains the local storage mechanism for draft persistence, including how drafts are saved (`saveLocal()`), how they're detected on initialization, and how users can choose to use, compare, or discard local versions through the `localVersion` and `deleteNewerVersion` functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of form validation logic is technically accurate
  
  The documentation accurately describes the validation process within the `savePage` function, noting that it "performs client-side validation to ensure a page type and URL are provided, broadcasting user-friendly error notifications via `$rootScope.$broadcast('notify', ...)`".

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of publish/schedule date handling is correct
  
  The documentation correctly explains how scheduled publishing works, noting that it "Allows content to be published at a future date and time" and that "the date/time input for scheduling is only visible when `page.publish` is set to `'schedule'`" and that it "initializes the `scheduleDate` with the current date for new pages."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the tag management and autocomplete feature explanation is technically accurate
  
  The tag management and autocomplete features are accurately described in the documentation, explaining how `autocompleteTags` queries the API for matching suggestions and how `selectSuggestion` allows users to add tags from suggestions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the relationship between controllers, factories, and templates is accurately explained
  
  The documentation clearly explains the MVC architecture and how the components interact: the controller (`pageCtrl`) contains business logic, the view (`page.html`) provides the user interface, and factories (`REST`, `Page`, `Users`) manage API communication and application state. The relationship between these components is accurately described throughout the document.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation correctly identifies and explains the purpose of broadcast events
  
  The documentation accurately identifies and explains broadcast events like `notify` for user notifications and `contentGet` for signaling components to refresh their views when data changes.
