# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies Angular.js as the framework used  
  The documentation clearly names "AngularJS" and refers to AngularJS constructs (e.g., controllers, factories, directives). This demonstrates an accurate identification of the framework.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all factories (REST, Page, Users) are accurately documented with their purposes  
  Each of the three factories (REST, Page, Users) is detailed regarding its functionality and purpose, with clear explanations of API calls and state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of the Page controller and its functionality is technically accurate  
  The documentation explains the responsibilities of the `pageCtrl` in terms of initialization, saving/updating, handling deletion, and managing local drafts, reflecting a correct technical description.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the RESTful API endpoints are correctly documented  
  All the REST endpoints are properly listed with associated URL parameters and custom methods, matching typical AngularJS $resource usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of Angular module dependencies ($resource, $location, etc.) is correct  
  The injected dependencies and their roles are described accurately, including how they facilitate routing, API interactions, and state management in the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the page management features (creating, editing, deleting) are accurately described  
  The documentation covers CRUD operations, the editing interface, and the deletion process through API calls, which aligns well with the expected functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately explains how the local storage mechanism works  
  The functionality for saving and restoring drafts via `localStorage` and the methods (`localVersion`, `deleteNewerVersion`) involved are well documented and technically sound.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of form validation logic is technically accurate  
  The explanation outlines client-side validation for required fields (like page type and URL) and the use of `$rootScope.$broadcast('notify', ...)` for error notifications, which is correct.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of publish/schedule date handling is correct  
  The scheduling feature, including the setting of the `scheduleDate` and conditional UI display based on the value of `page.publish`, is accurately described.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the tag management and autocomplete feature explanation is technically accurate  
  The functionality for querying tag suggestions, selecting suggestions, and updating the tag list is clearly and correctly explained.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the relationship between controllers, factories, and templates is accurately explained  
  The documentation properly describes how the controller (`pageCtrl`), factories (REST, Page, Users), and the view (`page.html`) interact within the AngularJS MVC pattern.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation correctly identifies and explains the purpose of broadcast events  
  The use of `$rootScope.$broadcast` for notification and content refresh events is explained, including its role in updating other components in the application.
