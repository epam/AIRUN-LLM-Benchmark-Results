# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation includes a comprehensive component overview explaining the purpose and architecture  
  The documentation begins with a high-level overview that explains the module’s purpose, architecture, and key design patterns used (AngularJS MVC), outlining components such as the controller, factories, and view.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all major components (REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and Page controller) are documented  
  Each of the major components is given its own section, including detailed descriptions of the REST factory, the state management factories for Page and Users, and the pageCtrl controller.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure all significant features of the page management system are described  
  The documentation covers CRUD operations, draft persistence, content versioning, state management, and scheduling. It provides a broad and detailed explanation of the module’s features.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all form inputs and their behavior are documented  
  The view (page.html) and the controller’s handling of input events (ng-model, ng-click, conditional displays, etc.) are described. Although not every single input is itemized, the explanation covers overall behavior and interactive patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page versioning and revision system  
  The documentation clearly explains that a new revision is created upon every save and details how revisions are managed through the REST endpoints and controller logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation covers the tag system and autocomplete functionality  
  The tag autocomplete functionality is explained in a dedicated section that describes the REST endpoint integration and the user interaction (autocompleteTags and selectSuggestion functions).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes explanation of error handling and user notifications  
  Error handling is addressed via client-side validations and the use of $rootScope.$broadcast to display user notifications, making the mechanism clear.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page publishing workflow including scheduling  
  The publishing workflow is documented in detail, including the options for immediate publishing, draft state, and scheduling with a date/time input.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation details how content extras and additional metadata are managed  
  There is a clear explanation of how extras are deleted and re-saved, and the associated REST endpoints (contentExtras, contentRevisionsExtras) are provided in the API table.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation explains how the UI interacts with the backend APIs  
  The interaction between the UI and backend via $resource in the REST factory, as well as the use of asynchronous calls in the controller, is documented comprehensively.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes sample usage examples or patterns  
  A sample route configuration is provided to illustrate how the module is integrated into an AngularJS application, which serves as a usage example.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains all significant event broadcasting and inter-component communication  
  The report details how events (such as 'notify' and 'contentGet') are broadcast to facilitate inter-component communication and state updates.
