# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation includes a clear, concise overview of each component's purpose and functionality
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all props are documented with their names, types, and descriptions
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation clearly distinguishes between required and optional props
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component's state management approach is accurately documented
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that sample code snippets demonstrate proper implementation of the components
- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that the documentation explains all ARIA roles and attributes implemented in the components

    The documentation mentions that "it does not include explicit ARIA roles or attributes" and that "for more complex applications, `aria` attributes could be added". It doesn't fully explain what ARIA roles and attributes are actually implemented in the components, if any. This is more of a mention that the implementation doesn't heavily rely on them rather than a comprehensive explanation of what is used.
