# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x
  
  The code imports React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, and `useCallback`, which are compatible with React 18.x. The implementation uses functional components with hooks, following the modern React approach.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
  
  The code includes proper TypeScript interfaces (`OptionType`, `SearchableSelectProps`), type annotations for React functional components (`React.FC<SearchableSelectProps>`), and appropriate typing for refs (`useRef<HTMLDivElement>`, `useRef<HTMLInputElement>`, `useRef<HTMLUListElement>`). Parameter and variable types are properly defined throughout the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling
  
  The component includes a comprehensive CSS file with appropriate styles for the select component, including styles for different states (highlighted, selected) and accessibility considerations.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments
  
  The code is well-structured, properly documented with comments, and contains no TODO comments or unfinished elements. It follows a clean, maintainable approach.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility
  
  The component correctly uses React's `useState` hooks for managing state variables such as `isOpen`, `searchTerm`, and `highlightedIndex`. The state is properly updated through appropriate handler functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props
  
  The component accepts customizable props through the `SearchableSelectProps` interface, including `options`, `value`, `onChange`, `placeholder`, and `id`, making it highly reusable across different contexts.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection
  
  The component implements thorough keyboard navigation through the `handleKeyDown` function, handling arrow keys, Enter, Escape, and Tab keys appropriately for accessibility and usability.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions
  
  The component uses React's `useRef` hook correctly for referencing DOM elements (`containerRef`, `inputRef`, `listRef`). It also follows best practices by using these refs for focused DOM manipulation rather than direct DOM access.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques
  
  The component manages focus appropriately, ensuring that the input element retains focus while the dropdown is open, and implements `aria-activedescendant` to indicate the currently highlighted option without moving actual DOM focus.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
  
  The component uses proper ARIA attributes, including `role="combobox"`, `aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-owns`, `aria-activedescendant`, `aria-controls`, `aria-autocomplete`, `role="listbox"`, `role="option"`, and `aria-selected`, ensuring screen reader compatibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  The code doesn't include any obvious patterns that would lead to console errors or warnings. All React dependencies are properly handled, and there are no direct DOM manipulations that would cause issues.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component
  
  The component uses `useCallback` for the `closeDropdown` function to prevent unnecessary re-renders. The component also avoids common pitfalls that would cause excessive re-renders, such as creating new functions or objects during each render.
