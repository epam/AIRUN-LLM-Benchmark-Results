# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  Although the code does not explicitly state "React 18.x", it uses modern React hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect, useRef) and patterns that are consistent with React 18.x usage. The absence of version-specific APIs or deprecated features gives reasonable confidence that it is compatible, even though an explicit version is not mentioned.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  The component is defined in .tsx files, and it uses well-defined TypeScript interfaces (e.g., OptionType, SearchableSelectProps), ensuring proper type definitions are in place.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  The provided file structure and content confirm that an index.css file is included, and it contains necessary styling for the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  The code is complete, well-organized, and there are no leftover TODO comments. It appears ready for production use.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  The component manages state (e.g., isOpen, searchTerm, highlightedIndex) using React's useState, and it handles state changes appropriately for both the dropdown visibility and selection logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  The component accepts customizable props such as options, value, onChange, placeholder, and id to allow for reuse in different contexts.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  The handleKeyDown function is implemented to manage keyboard events (Enter, Arrow keys, Escape, Tab), ensuring that accessibility and navigation are properly handled.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  The use of refs (containerRef, inputRef, listRef) and the appropriate effect hooks indicates that the component is following best practices for managing DOM interactions in React.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  Focus management is handled well (e.g., calling inputRef.current?.focus() after closing the dropdown), ensuring the user experience is smooth.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  The component uses several ARIA attributes (e.g., role="combobox", aria-haspopup, aria-expanded, aria-owns, aria-activedescendant, aria-controls, aria-autocomplete) to enhance accessibility.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  The code appears clean and production-ready with no visible issues in the implementation. Although without running it no runtime warnings can be 100% ruled out, the static review gives high confidence.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  The component uses useCallback for the closeDropdown function and manages state updates appropriately. This indicates a design that avoids unnecessary re-renders, though performance testing would be needed for absolute certainty.
