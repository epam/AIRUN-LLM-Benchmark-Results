# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element.  
  The component renders a <div> with role="combobox" and conditionally displays an unordered list (<ul>) as a dropdown, confirming the presence of a dropdown select UI element.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown.  
  The component includes an <input> field that accepts user input to filter options, serving as a search input.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown.  
  The component allows selection via the onChange prop with a singular OptionType value or null, ensuring single selection functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys.  
  The implementation handles 'ArrowDown' and 'ArrowUp' key events by adjusting the highlighted index, providing keyboard navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key.  
  When an option is highlighted, pressing Enter triggers the selection via the handleSelectOption function, as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused.  
  The onKeyDown handler opens the dropdown (by setting isOpen to true) when Enter is pressed while the dropdown is closed, toggling visibility appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes.  
  The closeDropdown function includes inputRef.current?.focus(), ensuring that focus returns to the input element after the dropdown is closed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click.  
  Mouse click events call handleSelectOption, which in turn calls closeDropdown, thereby closing the dropdown after selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard.  
  Similar to mouse interaction, selecting an option with the Enter key leads to closeDropdown being invoked, closing the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed.  
  The keydown handler for the 'Escape' key calls closeDropdown to close the dropdown, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component.  
  A useEffect hook registers a mousedown event listener to check clicks outside the component, triggering closeDropdown when necessary.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused.  
  When the input is focused and Enter is pressed while the dropdown is not open, the keydown handler updates isOpen to true, opening the dropdown.
