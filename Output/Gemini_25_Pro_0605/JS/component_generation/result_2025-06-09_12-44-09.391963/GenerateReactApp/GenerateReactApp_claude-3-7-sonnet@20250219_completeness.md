# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The code fetches characters from `https://swapi.dev/api/people` and renders them in a list.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The code includes a loading state and renders `<div className="loading">Loading Characters...</div>` when loading is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The code maps over `characters` array and renders each character in a list item.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  The code doesn't contain any search or input functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character is rendered as `<li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>`, showing the name.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The solution begins with instructions to use Create React App with TypeScript template and the file structure matches a CRA project.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The code has state for characters (`useState<Character[]>([])`), loading (`useState<boolean>(true)`), and error handling (`useState<string | null>(null)`).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each list item has a unique key using the character URL: `<li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  The application handles all states appropriately: loading state during fetch, error state if fetch fails, and rendering the list if successful. If the list is empty, it would render an empty `<ul></ul>`.
