# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The application fetches data from the SWAPI endpoint and, upon a successful fetch, renders a list of character names. The code properly maps over the retrieved characters and displays each name.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The component renders a div with the class "loading" and the message "Loading Characters..." while the API request is in progress.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  Once the API call is complete and if no error occurs, the code correctly iterates over the character data and displays each character’s name within a list item.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  The provided implementation does not contain any search forms or input elements; it strictly fetches and displays a list of characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each list item renders the 'name' property of the character object, ensuring that the character's name is visible in the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The instructions specify bootstrapping the project using Create React App with the TypeScript template, and the file structure as well as the presence of generated files (like 'package.json') confirm this setup.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The component uses React’s useState hook to manage state for loading, error, and characters, and it appropriately updates these states based on the API call’s outcome.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  The code uses the unique 'url' property from each character as the key for the list items, which is appropriate and optimal for React’s rendering.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  While the application correctly renders a list of characters when available, there is no explicit handling or user feedback (such as a “No characters found” message) for the case when the fetched data is an empty array. This could leave the user facing an empty view without explanation.
