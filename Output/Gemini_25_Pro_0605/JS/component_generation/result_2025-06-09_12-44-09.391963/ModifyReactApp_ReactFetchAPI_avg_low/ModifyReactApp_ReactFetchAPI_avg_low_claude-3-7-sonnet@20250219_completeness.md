# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name
  
  The code includes an input field with the placeholder "Search by name..." that captures user input in the `searchTerm` state variable and is used to filter characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests
  
  The component displays a "Loading..." message when the `loading` state is true, which is set during API requests.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query
  
  The `useEffect` hook triggers the `fetchCharacters` function when the component mounts with an initially empty `debouncedSearchTerm`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type
  
  The solution implements a debounce mechanism through the custom `useDebounce` hook, which updates `debouncedSearchTerm` after 500ms of user inactivity, triggering a new API call to update search results.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found
  
  The `renderContent` function displays a "No characters found." message when the `characters` array is empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design
  
  The component includes responsive styles, particularly the input field which has `width: '100%'` and `boxSizing: 'border-box'`, ensuring it adapts to different screen sizes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response
  
  Upon successful API response, the component displays the character list using a `<ul>` element with each character as a list item.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed
  
  The code includes error handling in the `fetchCharacters` function with a try-catch block that sets an error state and displays an error message to the user when API requests fail.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props
  
  The code defines appropriate TypeScript interfaces for `Character` and `SwapiPeopleResponse`, and all state variables have explicit type annotations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities
  
  The solution enhances the original functionality by adding search capabilities without removing or breaking any existing features. It continues to display the character list while adding the ability to filter by name.
