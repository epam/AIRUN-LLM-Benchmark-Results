# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type  
  The <input> element is bound to the searchTerm state and updates via onChange, which correctly reflects user input.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls  
  The custom hook useDebounce is implemented using a 500ms delay, which is within the specified range, ensuring API calls are made only after the user stops typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured  
  The code imports axios and uses axios.get with proper TypeScript generics. The API call is correctly configured with the search parameter appended to the URL.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses  
  The component, custom hook, and API response objects are all fully typed. Interfaces for Character and SwapiPeopleResponse are defined, providing strong typing throughout.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters  
  The URL string constructed as `https://swapi.dev/api/people/?search=${searchQuery}` correctly integrates the search parameter.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate  
  The fetchCharacters function is wrapped in useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-creations during renders. This meets the performance optimization requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback  
  A try-catch block is used to handle exceptions during the API call, and an error message is set in state and rendered, providing clear user feedback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing  
  By utilizing the debounced value from the useDebounce hook, the API requests are delayed until after the user has stopped typing for 500ms.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices  
  The code uses useState and useEffect hooks for managing state in a clear and concise manner, adhering to React best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code  
  The code is clean with no unnecessary commented-out lines or unused imports. Console.error is appropriately used for error logging.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests  
  The loading state is set to true before the API call and reset to false in the finally block, ensuring that the UI accurately reflects the loading status.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns  
  The component makes use of functional components, hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback), and TypeScript, aligning well with current React 18.x patterns.
