# Evaluation Report

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The component includes an <code>&lt;input type="text" placeholder="Search by name..." ... /&gt;</code> element that directly updates the <code>searchTerm</code> state, ensuring that users can filter characters by name.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  When a request is in progress, the component conditionally renders a <code>&lt;div&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;</code> message, clearly indicating that data is being fetched.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  On component mount, <code>searchTerm</code> is initially an empty string. This emptiness is debounced and passed to <code>fetchCharacters</code> via the <code>useEffect</code> hook, resulting in the initial data load from the API.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  The use of the custom <code>useDebounce</code> hook along with a dependency on the debounced value in the <code>useEffect</code> ensures that the component dynamically updates the displayed character list as the user types.

- **Pass (100%)**: Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  In the rendering logic, if the character list is empty (<code>characters.length === 0</code>), the component displays a <code>&lt;div&gt;No characters found.&lt;/div&gt;</code> message, thus providing clear visual feedback to the user.

- **Pass (95%)**: Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The inline styles (e.g., <code>maxWidth: '800px'</code> and <code>width: '100%'</code>) help ensure responsiveness. Although the implementation is basic, it provides a responsive layout appropriate for many scenarios. The slight deduction (5%) reflects that advanced responsive behaviors (such as media queries or more complex adaptive styling) are not present.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  Once the API call returns data, the component maps over the <code>characters</code> array and renders each character in an unordered list, thereby showing the search results.

- **Pass (90%)**: Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  The component implements error handling within the API call by catching errors and setting an <code>error</code> state, which then displays an error message to the user. While this handles API errors gracefully, it does not deploy a full React Error Boundary for unforeseen rendering errors. Hence, the confidence is slightly reduced from 100%.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The code defines the <code>Character</code> and <code>SwapiPeopleResponse</code> interfaces to strictly type the data from the API, alongside proper usage of generics in the custom <code>useDebounce</code> hook, ensuring comprehensive type safety.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The implemented modifications, including debounced search, memoized fetching function, error handling, and enhanced UI feedback, build on the original functionality without breaking or removing any existing features.
