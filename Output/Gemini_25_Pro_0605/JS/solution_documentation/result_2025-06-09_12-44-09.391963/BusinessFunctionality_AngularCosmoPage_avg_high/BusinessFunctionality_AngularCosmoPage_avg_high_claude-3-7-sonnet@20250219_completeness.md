# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation identifies all major components (REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, pageCtrl)
    
    The documentation clearly identifies all major components including the REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and pageCtrl in the Component Architecture & Data Flow section.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the purpose of the REST factory for API communication
    
    The documentation thoroughly explains the REST factory's purpose for API communication in the RESTful API Integration section, detailing that it acts as a client for the backend RESTful API using AngularJS's $resource service.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes all API endpoints exposed in the REST factory
    
    The documentation lists all the key API endpoints exposed in the REST factory including content, blocks, comments, files, menus, modules, themes, settings, and users, along with nested resources.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains the Page factory and its role in storing global page variables
    
    The documentation clearly explains that the Page factory acts as a global, in-memory data store (singleton) to hold the state of the current page, allowing data to be shared across controllers and views.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the Users factory and its purpose for user data management
    
    The documentation explains that the Users factory, like the Page factory, acts as a global in-memory data store for holding the state of the logged-in user, which is referenced in both the Component Architecture section and the Authentication section.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page controller's responsibilities and features
    
    The documentation describes the page controller (pageCtrl.js) as "the brain of the feature" that "orchestrates the data flow between the REST service, the Page factory, and the page.html view."

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the local storage mechanism for unsaved changes
    
    The documentation clearly describes the localStorage mechanism for saving unsaved work and preventing data loss from accidental browser closure or session interruption, both in the Main Functionality section and the UI Components section.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate the documentation explains the version comparison functionality
    
    The documentation mentions that there's a "Compare" option in the Version Conflict Bar, but notes that this functionality is "not fully implemented in this view." This suggests the functionality exists conceptually but may not be fully operational in the current implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the page creation workflow
    
    The documentation provides a detailed step-by-step explanation of the page creation workflow in the User Workflows section.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page editing workflow
    
    The documentation clearly explains the page editing workflow in the User Workflows section, including how users navigate to an existing page, modify content, and save changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the page duplication feature
    
    The documentation describes the page duplication feature in multiple sections, noting it allows users to duplicate an existing page to use as a template and mentioning that the new page must be given a unique URL.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains the page deletion process
    
    The documentation provides a detailed explanation of the page deletion process, including the confirmation prompt and the handling of associated data like revisions, extras, and tags.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the auto-URL generation from title feature
    
    The documentation clearly explains that as a user types a title, the URL field is automatically populated with a sanitized, lowercase, hyphenated version that can later be edited manually.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains tag management and autocompletion
    
    The documentation thoroughly explains the tag management system, including the ability to categorize pages with tags and the autocomplete feature that suggests existing tags to promote consistency.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the publication status options (publish, draft, schedule)
    
    The documentation clearly describes all three publication status options: Published (live), Draft (saved but not live), and Scheduled (to be published automatically at a future date/time).

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains scheduled content publishing
    
    The documentation explains scheduled content publishing, noting that selecting "Schedule" reveals a datetime-local input for picking the publication date and time, and that if a scheduled publication date is in the past, the page is published immediately upon saving.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes page revision management
    
    The documentation explains that every time a page is saved, a new revision is created, preserving a complete history of changes, and that this allows for auditing, comparison, or restoration of previous versions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the handling of page extras and additional data
    
    The documentation identifies "Extra" as a key entity, describing it as "a flexible key-value store for custom data associated with a page (e.g., a featured image URL)" and mentions saving/deleting extras in the savePage function analysis.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm the documentation describes form validation mechanisms
    
    The documentation mentions some validation rules (a page cannot be saved without a URL and a Page Type), but doesn't provide extensive details about form validation mechanisms or client-side validation implementation. There could be more explanation about how validation errors are presented to users.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate the documentation explains error handling during API operations
    
    The documentation points out a potential issue with the cascading API calls in the savePage function, noting that if any call fails, the page's data could be left in an inconsistent state. However, it doesn't fully detail the error handling mechanisms that might be in place to mitigate this risk.

- **Pass** (70%): Ensure the documentation describes notification messaging for user feedback
    
    The documentation doesn't explicitly describe a notification system for providing feedback to users after operations like saving, deleting, or encountering errors. This is a common UI pattern that might be present but isn't clearly documented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the theme-specific page types feature
    
    The documentation clearly explains that pages are associated with a "type" that corresponds to a template file from the active theme, and that users can select the page template from the current theme via a dropdown in the page editor form.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the documentation describes the featured image handling
    
    The documentation mentions featured images as an example of an "Extra" (a flexible key-value store for custom data associated with a page), but doesn't provide specific details on how featured images are selected, uploaded, or displayed in the UI.

- **Pass** (80%): Validate the documentation explains URL validation and error handling
    
    The documentation explains that URLs are generated from titles and can be manually edited, but doesn't provide detailed information about URL validation or how errors related to invalid or duplicate URLs are handled and communicated to users.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the tag suggestion system based on user input
    
    The documentation clearly explains the tag suggestion system, noting that it provides autocomplete suggestions for existing tags to promote consistency, and that it features an autocomplete dropdown that suggests existing tags.
