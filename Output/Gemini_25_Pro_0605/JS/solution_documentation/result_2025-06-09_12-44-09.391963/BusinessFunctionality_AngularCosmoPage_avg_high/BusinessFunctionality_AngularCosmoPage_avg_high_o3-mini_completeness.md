# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass** (100%): The documentation identifies all major components by mentioning the REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and page controller (pageCtrl.js).

2. **Pass** (100%): The documentation explains the purpose of the REST factory for API communication and details its usage for handling REST endpoints.

3. **Pass** (100%): The documentation describes the API endpoints exposed in the REST factory. It lists endpoints such as content, blocks, comments, files, menus, modules, themes, settings, and users, including nested resources.

4. **Pass** (100%): The documentation explains the Page factory and its role in storing global page variables used across controllers and views.

5. **Pass** (100%): The documentation describes the Users factory and its purpose for managing user data (e.g., id, username, role) that affects functionalities like permissions and saving content.

6. **Pass** (100%): The page controller's responsibilities and features are explained well, showing its role in orchestrating data flow between the REST service, factories, and the view.

7. **Pass** (100%): The documentation clearly describes the use of localStorage for unsaved changes (draft recovery), ensuring that users' work is saved temporarily.

8. **Pass** (90%): The documentation explains the version comparison functionality (via the Version Conflict Bar) which allows users to compare and either use or discard local changes.  
   Explanation: Although the basic concept is covered, details on how the “compare” functionality works are not fully elaborated.

9. **Pass** (100%): The page creation workflow is thoroughly described, including form behavior, auto-generation of URL from the title, and redirecting to the edit view after saving.

10. **Pass** (100%): The page editing workflow is explained, detailing how the form is pre-populated, changes are made, and the updated data is saved.

11. **Pass** (100%): The documentation includes a clear description of the page duplication feature and how it is intended to work as a template reuse mechanism.

12. **Pass** (100%): The process for deleting a page is described, including the confirmation step and cascade deletion (removing revisions, extras, and tags).

13. **Pass** (100%): The automatic URL generation from the title is covered in the workflow description, noting that a sanitized, lowercased, hyphenated version is created automatically.

14. **Pass** (100%): Tag management and autocompletion are well detailed. The documentation explains that tags can be added via an input supporting multiple entries with autocomplete suggestions.

15. **Pass** (100%): The documentation describes the publication status options (Published, Draft, Scheduled) and how users can select among these options.

16. **Pass** (100%): Scheduled content publishing is covered, with a mention that selecting the "Schedule" option reveals a datetime input for future publication.

17. **Pass** (100%): The documentation explains page revision management, stating that every save creates a new revision to preserve change history.

18. **Pass** (100%): The handling of page extras and additional data is mentioned, with some reference to extras related to the page (e.g., featured images noted later).

19. **Fail** (100%): The documentation does not provide detailed insights into form validation mechanisms; apart from mentioning character counters and required fields in business rules, it does not explain how the form validates inputs or handles invalid data.

20. **Fail** (100%): The documentation does not explain error handling during API operations. It mentions potential risks with the cascade of API calls but does not detail how errors are managed or recovered from.

21. **Fail** (100%): The documentation does not describe any notification messaging for user feedback (e.g., alerts or messages upon successful or failed operations), which is a notable omission.

22. **Pass** (100%): The theme-specific page types feature is described, explaining that pages are associated with a "type" corresponding to a template from the active theme.

23. **Pass** (100%): Featured image handling is briefly mentioned within the discussion of extras (e.g., a featured image URL), which suffices to indicate its management.

24. **Fail** (100%): URL validation and error handling are not explicitly addressed. While the auto-generation of URLs is explained, there is no discussion of how invalid URLs are handled or validated.

25. **Pass** (100%): The tag suggestion system based on user input is clearly described, indicating that the system provides autocomplete suggestions as users type.
