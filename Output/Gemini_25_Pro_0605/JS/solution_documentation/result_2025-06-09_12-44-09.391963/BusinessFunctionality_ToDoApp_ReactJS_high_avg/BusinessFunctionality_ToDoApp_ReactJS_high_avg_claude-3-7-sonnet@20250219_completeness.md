  The document comprehensively covers all main functionality of the Todo application. It explicitly mentions task creation, completion (toggling), editing, and deletion in section 1.1 (Main Functionality and Features) with corresponding code references.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about filtering todos by status (all, active, completed)
  
  The document clearly describes the task filtering functionality in section 1.1, mentioning that users can filter by "All tasks", "Only active tasks", and "Only completed tasks". It also references the implementation in the Router component and the filter logic in TodoApp.render().

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the user workflow for creating new todo items
  
  The document describes the user workflow for creating new todo items in section 2.1 and 2.2. It specifically mentions the main input field for adding todos, explains that it's auto-focused on page load, and notes that a new todo is created by pressing the Enter key.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the editing functionality triggered by double-clicking
  
  The document explicitly mentions that double-clicking the label initiates edit mode in section 2.1. It includes a code reference to the onDoubleClick event handler in TodoItem.tsx and describes the edit field behavior, including how editing is saved or canceled.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the clear completed functionality
  
  The document covers the "Clear Completed" functionality in both section 1.1 under "Bulk Operations" and in section 2.1. It specifies that this button appears only when there is at least one completed task and removes all completed tasks when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the toggle all functionality
  
  The toggle all functionality is described in section 1.1 under "Bulk Operations" and in section 2.1. The document explains that this feature allows users to mark all tasks as completed or active simultaneously and provides the code reference to TodoApp.toggleAll().

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the counter for remaining items
  
  The document mentions the counter for remaining items in section 2.1 when describing the TodoFooter component: "A 'View' component that displays summary information, including the count of active items...". It's also referenced in the footer description as providing "a persistent summary".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the persistent storage of todos
  
  The document clearly addresses the persistent storage of todos in section 1.1 under "Data Persistence". It explains that the user's list of tasks is saved automatically and persists across browser sessions using localStorage, and provides the code reference to Utils.store().

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the UI components and their relationships
  
  Section 1.2 "Core Components and Their Relationships" thoroughly describes the UI components (TodoApp, TodoModel, TodoItem, TodoFooter) and their relationships. It explains each component's responsibility and how they interact with each other.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the business objectives addressed by the application
  
  Section 3 "Business Objectives" comprehensively covers the primary and secondary business goals of the application, including providing a simple task manager, demonstrating robust frontend architecture, ensuring fast user experience, and providing zero-setup experience.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes performance and scalability considerations
  
  Section 5 "Performance and Scalability Considerations" thoroughly addresses performance optimizations and scalability limitations, including component-level optimization with shouldComponentUpdate and the limitations related to rendering, data storage, and state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes technical constraints and limitations
  
  Section 4 "Constraints and Assumptions" details the technical limitations and constraints, including the client-side only nature, legacy React patterns, external router dependency, and architectural assumptions.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the document covers the pluralization of item/items text based on count
  
  The document does not specifically mention the pluralization of "item/items" text based on the count of remaining items. This is a detail of the UI that would be helpful to include in the user interface description, but it is missing from the document.
