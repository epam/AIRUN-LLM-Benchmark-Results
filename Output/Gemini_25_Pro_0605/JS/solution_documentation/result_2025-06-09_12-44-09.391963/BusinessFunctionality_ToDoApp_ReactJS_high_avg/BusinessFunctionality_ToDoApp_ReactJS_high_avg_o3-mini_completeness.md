# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers all main functionality including adding, editing, deleting, and toggling todos  
  The answer clearly describes the processes for task creation, editing, deletion, and toggling (completion) of todos, citing specific code references.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about filtering todos by status (all, active, completed)  
  The answer explains that the application supports filtering by "All", "Active", and "Completed" tasks and references the corresponding routing/filter logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the user workflow for creating new todo items  
  The answer details the main input field behavior, auto-focus on page load, and the process of entering a new todo, which confirms the workflow for adding todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the editing functionality triggered by double-clicking  
  The answer explains that a double-click on a todo item initiates edit mode and details the subsequent save/cancel actions with appropriate code references.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the clear completed functionality  
  The answer mentions that completed tasks can be cleared via a "Clear completed" button and provides the associated code reference.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the toggle all functionality  
  The answer covers the "Toggle All" feature that allows users to mark all todos as complete or active and includes a related code reference.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the counter for remaining items  
  The answer explains that the footer component displays the count of active (remaining) items, indicating that such a counter is part of the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the persistent storage of todos  
  The answer details that todos are saved using localStorage, ensuring data persistence across browser sessions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the UI components and their relationships  
  The answer clearly describes each core component (TodoApp, TodoModel, TodoItem, TodoFooter), their roles, and relationships, following a component-based architecture.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the business objectives addressed by the application  
  The answer outlines both primary and secondary business goals, emphasizing the simplicity and efficiency of a personal task manager.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes performance and scalability considerations  
  The answer discusses optimizations like the use of shouldComponentUpdate in TodoItem, React's Virtual DOM, and outlines scalability limitations such as rendering performance and localStorage capacity.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes technical constraints and limitations  
  The answer identifies constraints such as the client-side only model, legacy React patterns, and the dependency on a global router, among others.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the document covers the pluralization of item/items text based on count  
  The answer does not explicitly mention how the application handles pluralization (e.g., displaying "item" versus "items" based on the count).  
  Although the counter for remaining items is noted, there is no discussion on whether the text dynamically adjusts between singular and plural forms.
