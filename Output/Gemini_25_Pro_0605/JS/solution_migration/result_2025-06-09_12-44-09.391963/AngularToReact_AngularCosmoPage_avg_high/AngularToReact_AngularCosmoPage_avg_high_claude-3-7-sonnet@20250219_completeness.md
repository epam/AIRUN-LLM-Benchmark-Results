# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented

    The code includes comprehensive page management functionality with the `handleSave` function in `PageEditor.tsx` supporting both creation and updating (with a duplicate parameter to differentiate). The `handleDelete` function handles page deletion. All operations use appropriate API calls via RTK Query hooks.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present

    Page type selection is implemented through a Select component in `PageDetailsForm.tsx` with appropriate event handlers to update the page type in the Redux store.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists

    URL auto-generation from title is implemented in the `handleTitleChange` function in `PageDetailsForm.tsx`. It converts the title to lowercase, replaces spaces with hyphens, and removes special characters to create a URL-friendly string.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented

    Tag management with autocomplete is implemented through the `TagInput` component and supported by appropriate API endpoints in the `apiSlice.ts` file, including `useAutocompleteTagsQuery`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available

    Publish status options are implemented via a RadioGroup component in `PageDetailsForm.tsx` with options for "publish", "draft", and "schedule".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented

    Scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented with a conditional datetime input that appears when the "schedule" option is selected, as shown in `PageDetailsForm.tsx`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present

    Local storage version comparison and restoration are implemented through the `usePageLocalStorage` custom hook, which compares stored values with server data and provides functions to load or delete the local version.

- **Pass** (95%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented

    A notification system is implemented using Redux with the `showNotification` action in various parts of the code. The notification component itself isn't fully detailed, but the slice and actions are properly implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present

    Form validation for required fields is implemented in the `handleSave` function in `PageEditor.tsx`, which checks if page type and URL are provided before proceeding with save operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled

    All API endpoints from the original code are properly handled through RTK Query in `apiSlice.ts`, covering content, tags, revisions, extras, themes, and user data.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented

    Extras management functionality is defined in the API layer with appropriate mutation hooks, though the UI implementation details for extras management aren't fully shown in the provided code snippets.

- **Pass** (85%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained

    Revision history API endpoints are included in the `apiSlice.ts` file, and the code mentions chaining calls for revisions in the `handleSave` function, but the UI implementation for viewing and managing revisions isn't fully detailed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components

    The code is well-organized into feature folders with clear separation of concerns: API logic in `apiSlice.ts`, state management in Redux slices, UI components in their own files, and custom hooks for complex logic like local storage handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved

    Translation functionality is preserved using the React i18next library, with the `useTranslation` hook used consistently throughout components to access translated strings.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters

    The application appears to maintain the same URL structure, using React Router's `useParams` to access URL parameters, and the navigation logic in `handleSave` and `handleDelete` preserves the URL patterns from the original application.
