# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props  
  All source files have been written in TypeScript (.ts/.tsx), and interfaces (e.g., in the "interfaces" folder) are defined for data models. While some functions rely on inferred types, overall the code adheres to TypeScript’s strict typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management  
  The implementation uses Redux Toolkit’s createSlice for slices (e.g., pageSlice and userSlice) and clearly demonstrates modern state management patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components  
  The code exclusively uses functional components (e.g., PageEditor, PageDetailsForm) and avoids class components entirely.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately  
  The components make proper use of hooks including useEffect, useCallback, and others like custom hooks (usePageLocalStorage), ensuring that side-effects and memoizations are handled properly.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource  
  API interactions are implemented via RTK Query with fetchBaseQuery, making use of the native fetch API under the hood rather than AngularJS’s $resource.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components  
  The form components (e.g., Input, Textarea, Select) are controlled components with their state managed via props and callbacks.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation  
  The code includes React Router hooks such as useParams and useNavigate which clearly demonstrates navigation handling in the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization  
  The implementation employs i18next (e.g., using the useTranslation hook) for handling internationalization effectively.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization  
  There is no explicit demonstration of code splitting (e.g., use of React.lazy or dynamic imports) in the provided code. While the project structure is modular, the actual code splitting optimization is absent.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations  
  The PageDetailsForm component uses React.memo to optimize rendering, indicating that performance considerations are made for expensive components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks  
  The hooks (useEffect, useCallback) include appropriate dependency arrays to ensure correct behavior and avoid unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models  
  The project defines TypeScript interfaces (e.g., in interfaces/index.ts) for data models such as Content, Tag, and User which fosters strong typing throughout the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state  
  The application leverages Redux selectors via the useAppSelector hook to access state, following best practices in state retrieval.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations  
  Action creators from Redux slices (using createSlice) are used throughout for managing state mutations, ensuring clear and explicit state transitions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks  
  The local storage logic is encapsulated in a custom hook (usePageLocalStorage) which manages checking, loading, and deleting locally saved data appropriately.
