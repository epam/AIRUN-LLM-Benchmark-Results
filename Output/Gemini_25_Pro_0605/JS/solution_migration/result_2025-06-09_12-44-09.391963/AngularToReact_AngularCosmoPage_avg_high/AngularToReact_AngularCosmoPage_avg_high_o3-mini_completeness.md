# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
  The code includes the handleSave function that handles both create and update operations with a duplicate flag, as well as a handleDelete function that supports deletion.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
  The PageDetailsForm component renders a Select component for page type, populated with theme pages, which satisfies this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
  In the PageDetailsForm component, the title change handler automatically generates a URL when there is no page ID, ensuring URL auto-generation.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
  The code integrates a TagInput component for managing tags and an RTK Query endpoint for autocomplete suggestions, addressing this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
  A RadioGroup component is used to offer publish, draft, and schedule options for publishing status in the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
  When the schedule option is selected, a datetime-local input is rendered to allow users to set a scheduled publishing date.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
  The custom hook usePageLocalStorage includes logic for detecting newer local versions and functions to load or clear these local versions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
  The code dispatches notifications via showNotification for both successful and failed operations, indicating a functioning notification system.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
  The handleSave function checks for the presence of both page type and a valid URL before proceeding with save operations, fulfilling the form validation requirement.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
  The apiSlice is extensive, covering endpoints for content retrieval, creation, updating, deletion, tag management, revisions, extras, themes, and user information. Some endpoints (like bulk deletion for revision extras) use assumptions based on expected API patterns; hence, the evaluation is marked with a slight uncertainty (95%).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
  API endpoints for creating and deleting content extras (and revision extras) are present, which confirms that extras management is implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
  Endpoints for creating and deleting content revisions ensure that the revision history features of the original system are preserved.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
  The project structure clearly separates API logic, state management (slices), hooks, components, and other utilities into distinct feature-based folders.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
  The use of react-i18next in components like PageEditor and PageDetailsForm demonstrates that translation functionality is maintained.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
  The use of URL parameters (e.g., passing the page URL via useParams) and navigating based on URLs (e.g., navigate(`/${newContent.url}`)) indicates that the application keeps the URL structure and parameters as required.
