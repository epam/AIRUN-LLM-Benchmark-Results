# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling
  
  The code clearly uses Angular's Reactive Forms approach with FormBuilder, FormGroup, and FormControl. This is evident in the signup.component.ts file where FormBuilder is injected and used to create a FormGroup with various form controls.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)
  
  The validation requirements are correctly implemented in the signup.validators.ts file with dedicated validator functions:
  - nameValidator checks for length between 3 and 60 characters
  - emailValidator uses validator.isEmail to verify email format
  - passwordValidator ensures minimum 6 characters

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use
  
  The code implements proper async validators through ExistingNameValidator and ExistingEmailValidator classes that implement AsyncValidator interface. These validators call the API service methods isName() and isEmail() to check if the name and email are already in use.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched
  
  The signup.component.html template includes ngClass directives that apply 'is-invalid' or 'is-valid' classes based on control state (valid/invalid and touched), which will apply the appropriate Bootstrap validation styling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions
  
  The onSubmit() method in the SignupComponent dispatches the signup action with the form values as payload. The SignupEffects class then handles the API call using the ApiService and dispatches success or failure actions based on the response.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails
  
  The FormGroupComponent handles displaying error messages through its template (form-group.component.html), which shows the error message when hasError is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service
  
  The SignupComponent correctly injects and uses Angular's Title service to set the page title in the ngOnInit method using the getTitle utility function.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management
  
  The code properly implements NgRx with:
  - Actions defined in signup.actions.ts
  - Effects for handling side effects in signup.effects.ts
  - Store interactions in the signup.component.ts

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress
  
  The submit button in signup.component.html has a [disabled] binding that disables the button when isSubmitting is true or when the form has pending async validations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses
  
  The signup$ effect in SignupEffects properly handles both success and error responses from the API call:
  - Success: Maps to signupSuccess action
  - Error: Maps to signupFailure action via catchError operator

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management
  
  The component follows Angular best practices:
  - Implements OnInit and OnDestroy interfaces
  - Properly cleans up subscriptions in ngOnDestroy
  - Uses getter methods for form controls
  - Separates concerns between components, validators, and effects

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises
  
  While the HttpClient isn't directly visible in the provided code, the API service methods used in the effects and validators return Observables and use RxJS operators (pipe, map, catchError, etc.), which is consistent with Angular's HttpClient approach rather than direct promises.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements
  
  The validation error messages in the validator functions match the requirements:
  - Name: "Name must be between 3 and 60 characters in length"
  - Email: "A valid email address is required"
  - Password: "Password must be at least 6 characters"
  - Existing name: "This name is already in use"
  - Existing email: "This email is already in use"
