# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The SignupComponent uses Angular’s FormBuilder to create a FormGroup (signupForm) and employs reactive form directives.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  Synchronous validations are implemented via custom validators (nameValidator, emailValidator, passwordValidator) ensuring name length, valid email, and minimum password length.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  The asynchronous validators (ExistingNameValidator and ExistingEmailValidator) correctly invoke the API service to verify name and email uniqueness.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The template applies conditional CSS classes using ngClass to show 'is-invalid' for errors and 'is-valid' for valid states when the fields are touched. Additionally, error messages are rendered by the FormGroupComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  The onSubmit() method dispatches the SignupActions.signup action with the form payload and leverages @ngrx/store for state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The FormGroupComponent displays error messages under the input fields using a dedicated template block for validation feedback.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  The SignupComponent sets the document title on initialization using titleService.setTitle(getTitle('Signup')).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The component dispatches actions to the store and subscribes to actions (signupSuccess, signupFailure) via @ngrx/effects for handling side effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button is disabled when either isSubmitting is true or the form is pending, ensuring it is not clickable during submission.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  The SignupEffects file uses map for successful responses (dispatching signupSuccess) and catchError for error responses (dispatching signupFailure).

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component implements OnInit and OnDestroy correctly, unsubscribing from subscriptions. Although overall best practices are followed, the confidence is slightly less than 100% as some project-specific best practices details might vary.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The code uses an ApiService for HTTP requests, which is assumed to wrap Angular’s HttpClient. The evaluation relies on this assumption since the ApiService implementation isn’t shown. Hence, there is a slight uncertainty.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  Each validator returns error messages that clearly articulate the validation issues (e.g., name length, valid email format, minimum password length), and these messages are displayed below the input fields.
