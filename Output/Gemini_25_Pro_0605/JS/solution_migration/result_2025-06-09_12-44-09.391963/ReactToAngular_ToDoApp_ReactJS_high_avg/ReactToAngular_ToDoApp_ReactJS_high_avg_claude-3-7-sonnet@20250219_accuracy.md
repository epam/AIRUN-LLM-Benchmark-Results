# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The provided code uses Angular framework with proper imports from '@angular/core' and other Angular packages. While the exact version number isn't explicitly stated in the code, the structure and syntax are compatible with Angular 14.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
  
  The application properly implements NgRx store with imports from '@ngrx/store' and includes store configuration in the app.module.ts file. It uses createReducer, createAction, createSelector, and other NgRx primitives.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
  
  The code includes a complete implementation of NgRx effects in todo.effects.ts, with proper use of createEffect and handling of side effects for loading and saving todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
  
  The code includes a comprehensive set of actions in todo.actions.ts, a properly structured reducer in todo.reducer.ts, and well-organized selectors in todo.selectors.ts.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
  
  All components use the @Component decorator, and child components correctly use @Input and @Output decorators for component communication.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators
  
  The TodoItemComponent properly uses @ViewChild to reference the edit input element, replacing React's ref functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
  
  The components properly use @Input for property binding and @Output with EventEmitter for event handling, following Angular best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
  
  The code includes StorageService and UuidService as injectable Angular services for handling data persistence and generating unique IDs.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
  
  Dependency injection is correctly implemented with services provided in the 'root' injector and components receiving dependencies through constructor injection.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
  
  The TodoItemComponent uses ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush for improved performance, and the TodoFooterComponent also implements OnPush.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
  
  The application properly implements Angular Router with AppRoutingModule, route definitions, router-outlet, and routerLink directives.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code follows Angular style guide conventions with proper naming (kebab-case for files, PascalCase for classes), folder structure, and component organization.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
  
  The code properly defines and uses TypeScript interfaces (Todo, TodosState, AppState) and type aliases (TodoFilter) throughout the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
  
  All React JSX has been properly converted to Angular HTML templates with appropriate Angular directives (ngIf, ngFor, ngClass).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
  
  React event handlers have been replaced with Angular event bindings using the parentheses syntax (click), (change), etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs
  
  The provided code does not contain any TODO comments or unfinished implementations.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules
  
  The code does not implement lazy loading for feature modules. The application uses a simple routing structure with eagerly loaded components. There are no feature modules defined with the loadChildren syntax that would enable lazy loading.
