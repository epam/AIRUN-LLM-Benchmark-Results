# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items

    The implementation includes a `todo-list.component.html` that properly displays todo items using `*ngFor` directive and the `visibleTodos$` observable from the store. The component subscribes to the relevant selector that provides the list of todos based on the current filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented

    The application implements the add todo functionality through the `TodoHeaderComponent` which emits an event when a user enters a new todo and presses enter. This event is handled by the `TodoListComponent` which dispatches the `addTodo` action to the NgRx store.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works

    The toggle functionality is implemented in the `TodoItemComponent` which emits an event when the checkbox is clicked. This event is handled by the `TodoListComponent` which dispatches the `toggleTodo` action to update the completion status of the todo item.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented

    Editing is fully implemented with double-click to start editing, blur or enter to save changes, and escape to cancel. The implementation uses `ViewChild` to focus the edit input, and proper state management with NgRx to track which item is being edited.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented

    Deletion is implemented through a button in the `TodoItemComponent` that emits a `removeTodo` event, which is caught by the parent component to dispatch the appropriate action to remove the item from the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented

    The "toggle all" checkbox is correctly implemented in the `todo-list.component.html` and tied to the `areAllTodosCompleted$` observable. When clicked, it dispatches the `toggleAllTodos` action with the appropriate completion status.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works

    The filtering functionality is implemented using Angular Router with routes for '/', '/active', and '/completed'. The `TodoListComponent` subscribes to route changes and dispatches the `setFilter` action accordingly. The selectors properly filter the todos based on the current filter state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items

    The `TodoFooterComponent` receives the `activeTodoCount` input from its parent and displays it correctly with proper pluralization using the custom `PluralizePipe`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items

    The footer component conditionally shows the 'Clear completed' button when there are completed items, and it correctly emits an event that triggers the `clearCompletedTodos` action in the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage

    The application uses the `StorageService` which provides methods to get and save todos from/to `localStorage`. The NgRx effects properly handle the persistence, loading todos on initialization and saving them whenever relevant actions are dispatched.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation

    The routing configuration in `app-routing.module.ts` maintains the same URL structure as the original application with routes for '/', '/active', and '/completed'.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states

    The application conditionally renders the main section and footer only when there are todos, using the `hasTodos$` observable, ensuring appropriate UI for empty states.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly

    Form submissions for adding and editing todos are properly handled with appropriate event handling, including preventing default behavior where needed and trim operations on input values.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships

    The component hierarchy is well structured with appropriate parent-child relationships: `AppComponent` -> `TodoListComponent` -> `TodoHeaderComponent`, `TodoItemComponent`, and `TodoFooterComponent`. Each component has clear responsibilities and communication is done through inputs/outputs.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved

    All business logic from the original application has been successfully migrated to the NgRx store pattern, with actions, reducers, selectors, and effects that capture the same behavior. This includes adding, toggling, editing, deleting todos, filtering, toggling all, and clearing completed todos.
