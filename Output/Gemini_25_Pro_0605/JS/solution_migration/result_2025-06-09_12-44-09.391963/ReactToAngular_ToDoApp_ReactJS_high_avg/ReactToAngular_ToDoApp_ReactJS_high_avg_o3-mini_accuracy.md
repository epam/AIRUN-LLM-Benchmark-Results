# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The answer clearly states that the provided application is "the migrated Angular 14.x application" and all code files are consistent with Angular conventions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The application imports and sets up StoreModule with a defined reducer and uses selectors to extract state data.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  The code includes a fully implemented effects module in the file "todo.effects.ts" where side effects such as localStorage interactions are handled.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  The answer provides clear implementations for actions (todo.actions.ts), the reducer (todo.reducer.ts), and selectors (todo.selectors.ts), which all align with NgRx best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  All components are decorated with @Component, and inputs/outputs are properly declared using @Input() and @Output() as seen throughout the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  In the TodoItemComponent, React refs are appropriately replaced with @ViewChild, ensuring the correct usage of Angular’s element referencing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  The components consistently utilize @Input() for property binding and @Output() with EventEmitter for communication between parent and child components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  The application includes Angular services such as StorageService and UuidService that encapsulate business logic and data management.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  All services and necessary modules are injected via constructors, following Angular's dependency injection principles.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  Components like TodoItemComponent and TodoFooterComponent use ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush to optimize performance.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  The application defines routes in the AppRoutingModule and uses routerLink and routerLinkActive in templates for navigation.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code is well-structured and separated into modules, components, services, and stores. However, without explicit linters or style configuration details provided, the evaluation is based on the code organization and naming conventions observed.  
  (Explanation: While the code follows common Angular practices, without additional configuration details (e.g., use of Angular CLI standards throughout), the confidence is slightly less than 100%.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  The provided code includes clear TypeScript interfaces, such as Todo, and proper type annotations in services and store definitions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  All templates are provided as Angular HTML, and there is no trace of JSX syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  React event handlers have been replaced by Angular’s event binding syntax (e.g., (keyup.enter), (change)), confirming the adaptation to Angular conventions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  There are no lingering "TODO" comments in the code, and all intended functionality is implemented.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  The routing configuration in AppRoutingModule directly references components without using the "loadChildren" syntax for lazy loading. No feature modules are lazily loaded, which does not fulfill this requirement.
