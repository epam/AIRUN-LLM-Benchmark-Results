# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The migrated code uses a selector (selectVisibleTodos) in the TodoListComponent and employs an *ngFor loop to render each todo item. This confirms that all todo items are being displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoHeaderComponent captures new todo titles and emits an event that the TodoListComponent listens to and dispatches an addTodo action. The reducer then updates the state accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  Each TodoItemComponent emits a toggleTodo event on checkbox change. The reducer processes the toggleTodo action by flipping the “completed” flag on the matched todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent handles editing mode, including focusing the input, submitting updates, and canceling edits. The corresponding updateTodo action in the reducer confirms that editing functionality is in place.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent provides a remove button that emits a removeTodo event. This event is handled by TodoListComponent, dispatching a removeTodo action that successfully deletes the specific todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  The TodoListComponent template includes a “toggle-all” checkbox, and the onToggleAll method dispatches a toggleAllTodos action. In the reducer, the toggleAllTodos action updates every todo to the desired completed status.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  The routing configuration maps paths ("/", "/active", "/completed") appropriately. The selector (selectVisibleTodos) applies filtering logic based on the current filter stored in state, ensuring accurate filtering.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooterComponent receives the activeTodoCount from the store and displays it along with a pluralization pipe. This confirms the footer accurately shows the count of active todo items.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The footer template contains a “Clear completed” button that emits a clearCompleted event. The reducer handles the clearCompletedTodos action by filtering out all completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  The StorageService is implemented to read and write todos to localStorage. NgRx effects (saveTodos$ and loadTodos$) use this service for persistence, ensuring todos are maintained across browser sessions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The AppRoutingModule explicitly defines routes for '', '/active', and '/completed' (as well as a catch-all route), preserving a URL structure similar to that of the original application.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  The TodoListComponent conditionally renders the main section via *ngIf (hasTodos$) to handle cases with no todos. Although there isn’t an explicit “empty state” message, the omission of the list and footer when there are no todos is an acceptable approach. (Reduced confidence due to lack of an explicit empty state message.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  The use of Angular’s FormsModule, input event bindings (e.g., (keyup.enter)) in the header for adding todos, and (blur) or (keyup.enter) events in the item component ensures that form submissions are managed appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The application is composed of clear, modular components (TodoHeaderComponent, TodoListComponent, TodoItemComponent, TodoFooterComponent) that communicate through Input/Output bindings and shared state managed via NgRx, maintaining a clear component hierarchy.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  The migration preserves the core aspects of the original todo app: adding, toggling, editing, deleting, filtering, persisting todos, and handling additional functionalities like “mark all complete” and “clear completed”. The NgRx reducer and effects maintain the business logic seamlessly.
