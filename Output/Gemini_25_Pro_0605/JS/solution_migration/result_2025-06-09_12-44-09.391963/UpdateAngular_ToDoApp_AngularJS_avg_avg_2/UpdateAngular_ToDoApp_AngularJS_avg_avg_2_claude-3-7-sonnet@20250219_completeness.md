- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list
  
  The application has a dedicated `TodoListComponent` which is defined in `src/app/components/todo-list/todo-list.component.ts` and its corresponding HTML template that renders the list of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos
  
  The application includes a `HeaderComponent` that contains the functionality for adding new todos, with an input field and form submission handler defined in `src/app/components/header/header.component.ts`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos
  
  The `TodoItemComponent` in `src/app/components/todo-item/todo-item.component.ts` includes functionality for editing existing todos through a double-click interaction.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos
  
  The `FooterComponent` in `src/app/components/footer/footer.component.ts` contains the filter links for "All", "Active", and "Completed" todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics
  
  The `FooterComponent` also displays count statistics with the remaining todo items shown in the todo-count section.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos
  
  The `HeaderComponent` implements an `addTodo()` method that dispatches the `TodoActions.addTodo` action with the new todo title.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos
  
  The `TodoItemComponent` implements editing functionality with methods like `startEdit()`, `finishEdit()`, and `cancelEdit()`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos
  
  The `TodoItemComponent` includes a `removeTodo()` method that dispatches the `TodoActions.removeTodo` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed
  
  The `TodoItemComponent` implements a `toggleCompletion()` method that dispatches the `TodoActions.updateTodo` action to toggle the completed status.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The `FooterComponent` includes a `setFilter()` method that dispatches the `TodoActions.setFilter` action, and the `TodoListComponent` renders filtered todos based on the selected filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete
  
  The `TodoListComponent` includes a `toggleAll()` method that dispatches the `TodoActions.toggleAllTodos` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos
  
  The `FooterComponent` includes a `clearCompleted()` method that dispatches the `TodoActions.clearCompletedTodos` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos
  
  The `FooterComponent` displays the count of remaining todos in its template with `{{ remainingCount$ | async }}`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage
  
  The `StorageService` handles localStorage persistence with `get()` and `put()` methods, and the `TodoEffects` ensures todos are saved whenever they change.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization
  
  The `AppComponent` dispatches the `TodoActions.loadTodos` action in its `ngOnInit` method, which triggers the loading of todos from localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing
  
  The `TodoEscapeDirective` handles escape key presses, and the `TodoItemComponent` template binds this directive to the edit input with `(appTodoEscape)="cancelEdit()"`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo
  
  The `TodoFocusDirective` handles automatic focusing, and the `TodoItemComponent` template binds this directive to the edit input with `[appTodoFocus]="editing"`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original
  
  The application imports the original CSS files (`base.css` and `index.css`), and the HTML structure follows the same patterns as the original TodoMVC application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately
  
  The `HeaderComponent` checks for empty titles with `if (title)` before adding a todo, and the `TodoItemComponent` removes a todo if its title becomes empty after editing.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter
  
  The provided code does not include any routing configuration or URL manipulation when filters are changed. In a TodoMVC application, changing filters typically updates the URL (e.g., `#/active`, `#/completed`), but this functionality is missing in the migrated code.
