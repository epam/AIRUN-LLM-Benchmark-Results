# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The answer clearly states “Angular 14.x” and the provided module setup and project structure are consistent with Angular 14.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
  The application uses standard ES module imports (using import/export syntax) rather than RequireJS’s module definition style.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
  The code imports and configures @ngrx/store (using StoreModule.forRoot) and includes related reducers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
  The implementation imports EffectsModule and defines effects in TodoEffects, fulfilling the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
  The answer includes detailed implementations of actions, reducers, selectors, and effects specifically for managing todo items.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
  The StorageService is correctly decorated with @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
  The StorageService correctly uses localStorage’s getItem and setItem methods for persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
  All components (e.g., HeaderComponent, TodoListComponent, TodoItemComponent, FooterComponent) are correctly decorated with @Component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
  Both directives (TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective) correctly use the @Directive decorator.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
  The templates make proper use of Angular structural directives like *ngFor and *ngIf.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
  Event bindings such as (click) and (ngSubmit) are used appropriately across the components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
  Property bindings (e.g., [class.completed]) are applied correctly in component templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
  Lifecycle hooks (e.g., OnInit in AppComponent and ngOnChanges in TodoFocusDirective) are implemented correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
  The Todo model is defined using a TypeScript interface along with a Type alias for FilterType.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
  The code demonstrates proper dependency injection in components and services using constructor injection.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The project is organized and named consistently with Angular best practices. There is a small inline note for trackById, but it does not detract significantly from overall adherence.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
  Based on the provided code and structure, there are no apparent mistakes that would cause console errors or warnings.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
  The code makes appropriate use of TypeScript features, including type annotations, interfaces, and enums (via type aliases).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
  The source code is clean and does not include extraneous TODO comments or commented-out code that might indicate incomplete work.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design  
  Each component, service, directive, and store-related file has a well-defined responsibility, demonstrating adherence to the single responsibility principle.
