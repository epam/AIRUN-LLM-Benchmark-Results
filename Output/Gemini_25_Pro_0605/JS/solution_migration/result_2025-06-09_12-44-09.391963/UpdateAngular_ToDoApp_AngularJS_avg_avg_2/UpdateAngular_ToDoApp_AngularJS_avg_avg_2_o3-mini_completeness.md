  The application includes a dedicated "todo-list" component that renders the list of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos  
  The "header" component provides an input field and dispatches an action to add new todos.

  The "footer" component shows the remaining count of items using observables from the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos  
  The "header" component’s addTodo() method correctly dispatches the addTodo store action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos  
  Editing is handled in the "todo-item" component, with proper checks in finishEdit() dispatching updateTodo actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos  
  The "todo-item" component includes a removeTodo() method tied to the destroy button.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed  
  Both individual todo toggling and the "toggle all" functionality in the "todo-list" component are implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)  
  Filtering is managed in the "footer" component and the store, with a setFilter action updating the filter state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete  
  The "todo-list" component provides a toggleAll method that dispatches the toggleAllTodos action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos  
  The "footer" component includes a clearCompleted button that dispatches the clearCompletedTodos action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos  
  The remaining todo count is derived via a selector and displayed in the "footer" component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage  
  A dedicated StorageService is used together with NgRx effects to persist todos in localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization  
  The AppComponent dispatches a loadTodos action during initialization which loads todos from localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing  
  The todo-escape directive is implemented to emit events when the Escape key is pressed, allowing editing to be cancelled.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo  
  The todo-focus directive ensures that the input field is focused when a todo is in edit mode.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original  
  The provided code follows the TodoMVC conventions and CSS class naming (e.g., "todoapp", "header", "footer") which suggest visual consistency.  
  (Confidence is 90% because without a direct visual comparison or screenshot, we assume that adherence to CSS structure means appearance is maintained.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately  
  In the todo-item component’s finishEdit() method, empty titles result in removing the todo, ensuring that empty entries are not kept.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter  
  There is no implementation in the provided code that changes or updates the URL when a filter is selected. The filtering is managed solely by store state, and no routing or URL synchronization is evident.
