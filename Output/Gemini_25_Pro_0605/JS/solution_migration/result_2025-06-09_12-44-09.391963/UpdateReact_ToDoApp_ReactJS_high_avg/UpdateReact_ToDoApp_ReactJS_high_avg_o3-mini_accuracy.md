# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all React imports use React 18.x compatible syntax  
  All React-related imports use the updated API such as using createRoot from "react-dom/client" in index.tsx.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all components use functional component syntax with hooks instead of class components  
  Every component in the code is a functional component that uses hooks like useState, useEffect, and useCallback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Redux Toolkit's createSlice is used for state management  
  Both "todosSlice" and "filtersSlice" are implemented using Redux Toolkit's createSlice.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for all props, state, and Redux store  
  The code defines interfaces (e.g., for Todo, TodosState) and uses TypeScript types for Redux store and component props.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses immutable state updates in reducers  
  Reducers rely on Redux Toolkit’s use of Immer, enabling mutations like push and filter while maintaining immutability under the hood.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that nanoid is used for ID generation instead of custom UUID implementation  
  In the todosSlice, the addTodo reducer uses nanoid for generating unique IDs.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application uses React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate  
  The TodoItem component is wrapped in React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that useCallback is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders  
  Several event handlers in the TodoItem component are wrapped with useCallback. Although not every handler (e.g., in Header) is wrapped, the use of useCallback in performance-critical areas helps mitigate excessive re-renders.  
  (Slight uncertainty exists since not every component applies useCallback, but overall key areas are optimized.)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage handling is implemented in a modern way  
  The loadState and saveState functions are properly implemented with error handling using try-catch blocks.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code follows consistent naming conventions throughout the application  
  The naming conventions (e.g., file names, variable names, and slice names) are consistent and follow common patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper error handling is implemented where necessary  
  Error handling is present in the index.tsx when a root element is not found and within the localStorage utility functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware  
  The Redux store is set up using Redux Toolkit’s configureStore with an additional custom middleware for localStorage synchronization.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that React.lazy is used for code splitting where appropriate  
  There is no use of React.lazy to dynamically import components for code splitting. This could benefit the application’s performance by enabling lazy loading of the App component or other feature modules.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the codebase has no TODOs remaining  
  The provided code does not contain any leftover TODO comments.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux Provider wraps the application entry point  
  The index.tsx file correctly wraps the App component with the Redux Provider.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure strict TypeScript type checking is implemented throughout the application  
  The code demonstrates strict type usage with TypeScript, employing interfaces and proper types for Redux store, components, and utility functions.
