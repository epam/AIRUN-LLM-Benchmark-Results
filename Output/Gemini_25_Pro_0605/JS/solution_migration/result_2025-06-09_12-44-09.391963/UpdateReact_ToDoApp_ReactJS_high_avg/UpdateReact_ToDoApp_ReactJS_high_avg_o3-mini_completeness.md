# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The Header component listens for the keyDown event. When the Enter key is pressed (using the constant ENTER_KEY) and the input text is trimmed (non-empty), it dispatches the addTodo action and clears the input.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The TodoList component applies a filter based on the Redux filter state. It uses a useMemo hook to compute filteredTodos, ensuring that the list displays the correct items based on whether the filter is 'all', 'active', or 'completed'.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  The TodoList component includes a checkbox that, upon change, dispatches the toggleAllTodos action with the new checked state. This satisfies the requirement to toggle the completion status of all todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  In the TodoItem component, an individual todo can be toggled via a checkbox, edited by entering an editing mode (via double-click), and deleted with the destroy button. All these behaviors are implemented through the appropriate Redux actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  The TodoItem component listens for a double-click event on the label. When detected, it sets the isEditing state to true, enabling the editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  Within the TodoItem componentâ€™s keyDown handler, pressing the Enter key triggers handleSave, which commits the changes by dispatching the updateTodo action (or deleting the todo if the text is empty).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  The keyDown handler in TodoItem also checks for the Escape key. When pressed, it resets the editText state to the original todo title and exits the editing mode by setting isEditing to false.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  The Footer component calculates the number of active (non-completed) todos and renders this count within a span element, thereby correctly displaying the active item count.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  Within the Footer, the filter links are rendered using the Link component from react-router-dom. They correspond to the 'all', 'active', and 'completed' filters, allowing users to change the view as needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  The Footer conditionally renders a "Clear completed" button when completed todos are present. This button dispatches clearCompletedTodos when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  A custom middleware in the Redux store configuration intercepts actions from the todos slice. It serializes and saves the todos to localStorage, ensuring persistence across sessions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  Overall UI elements such as the TodoList and Footer are rendered only when todos exist, ensuring a clean and conditional display of elements depending on the current state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  The utility function pluralize is used in the Footer to determine whether to show "item" or "items" based on the number of active todos, handling pluralization correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The code is divided into multiple smaller components (Header, TodoList, TodoItem, Footer) that handle specific responsibilities. This separation facilitates maintainability and clarity.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The project structure is well-organized. Files are grouped by feature (e.g., todos, filters) and application-level concerns are placed under an app folder. This organization adheres to best practices.
