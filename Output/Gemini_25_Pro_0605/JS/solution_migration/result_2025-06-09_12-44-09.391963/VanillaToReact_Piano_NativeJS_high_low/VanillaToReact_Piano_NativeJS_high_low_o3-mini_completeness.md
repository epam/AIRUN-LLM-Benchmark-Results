# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'  
  The Header component returns a header element with an h1 that contains "Virtual Piano". 

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons  
  The Controls component correctly renders two buttons inside a container (div with class "btn-container"), one labeled “Notes” and the other “Letters”, and applies the active styling based on state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)  
  The Piano component maps over the white keys (defined in WHITE_KEYS_DATA) and the black keys (in BLACK_KEYS_DATA), rendering a corresponding key for each. 

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes  
  Every piano key element includes the data attributes (data-note and data-letter) so that the keys display the correct note or letter depending on the toggle.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked  
  The application uses a sound mapper to play audio files on key activation. Although the mapping for some notes (for example, the note 'c' mapped to a.mp3) might seem unusual at first glance, it appears to be preserving the original implementation. This leads to a minor uncertainty regarding whether the mapping is intentional or an oversight in the original code, but overall audio playback is functioning as intended.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)  
  When a key is activated, the component adds the 'piano-key-active' class, which visually highlights the pressed key.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes  
  The Piano component attaches keydown and keyup event listeners that map keys (using KEY_TO_NOTE_MAP) to the corresponding notes and triggers the play/stop functions accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked  
  The toggle logic in the App component (passed as a prop to Controls and Piano) correctly switches between showing note names and letters based on the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes  
  The FullscreenButton component implements the logic to request and exit fullscreen, toggling based on the document’s fullscreenElement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly  
  The use of a Set to track active notes and the independent event handling for each key, along with prevention of repeated trigger events, indicate that the application correctly manages simultaneous key interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys  
  Mouse event handlers (onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseOut, and onMouseEnter) are implemented to enable note playing when dragging across keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information  
  The Footer component is rendered with a div that displays the year "2020".
