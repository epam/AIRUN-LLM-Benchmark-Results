# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18.x
  
  The application explicitly uses React 18 features such as the new root API (`ReactDOM.createRoot`) in the `index.tsx` file, which is specific to React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript for type safety
  
  TypeScript is used throughout the codebase with proper type definitions, interfaces, and type annotations. Examples include the `Todo` and `FilterType` interfaces in `src/types/index.ts` and proper type annotations for components, props, and state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for state management
  
  The application correctly implements Redux Toolkit with the `createSlice` API in `todoSlice.ts` to manage todo state and actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm nanoid is used for generating unique IDs
  
  The code imports and uses `nanoid` from `@reduxjs/toolkit` to generate unique IDs for new todos in the `addTodo` prepare callback function.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code uses functional components with hooks instead of class components
  
  All components are implemented as functional components using React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, and custom Redux hooks (`useAppDispatch`, `useAppSelector`).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains the same routing functionality with proper route handling
  
  The application implements hash-based routing through the custom `useHashRouter` hook in `App.tsx`, which handles route changes and dispatches the appropriate filter action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Redux store is properly configured with appropriate slices
  
  The Redux store is properly configured in `store.ts` with the todos reducer and includes middleware for local storage persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the Redux provider is set up in the application entry point
  
  The Redux `Provider` component is correctly set up in `index.tsx` to wrap the main `App` component, making the store available throughout the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for all data structures
  
  The code defines proper TypeScript interfaces and types for all data structures, including `Todo`, `FilterType`, `TodosState`, `RootState`, and `AppDispatch`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows React best practices for component composition
  
  The application follows best practices by breaking down the UI into logical, reusable components (`Header`, `TodoList`, `TodoItem`, `Footer`, etc.) with clear separation of concerns.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles keyboard events properly (Enter key for creating/updating todos, Escape key for canceling edits)
  
  Keyboard events are properly handled in the `Header` and `TodoItem` components, with Enter key submitting new todos and updates, and Escape key canceling edits.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application maintains local storage persistence if implemented
  
  The application implements local storage persistence through the `localStorage.ts` utility and a custom Redux middleware that saves todos to local storage when they change.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  The code appears to be free of console errors and warnings in normal operation, but there are error handling sections (in the localStorage utility) that might log errors to the console in exceptional cases. This is generally acceptable as it provides debugging information.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the application implements proper error handling
  
  The application includes try-catch blocks for local storage operations but doesn't have comprehensive error handling for all potential edge cases. However, the error handling that is present is appropriate for the application's needs.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm the code is optimized with no unnecessary re-renders
  
  The code uses appropriate techniques to avoid unnecessary re-renders, including:
  - Memoized selectors with `createSelector`
  - Proper state management with Redux
  - Proper component structure
  
  However, there's no explicit use of React.memo or useMemo/useCallback, which might be beneficial for more complex components, though the current implementation is likely efficient for most use cases.
