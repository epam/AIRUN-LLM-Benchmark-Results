# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18.x  
  The code uses the new ReactDOM.createRoot API (imported from 'react-dom/client') which is standard in React 18. This confirms the application is built with React 18.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript for type safety  
  All files use .ts or .tsx extensions and include TypeScript-specific syntax such as interfaces for data structures and type annotations in functions/components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for state management  
  The code imports and uses createSlice from Redux Toolkit in the todos slice. The slice implementation follows the standard pattern defined by Redux Toolkit.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm nanoid is used for generating unique IDs  
  The code uses the nanoid function (imported from Redux Toolkit) inside the addTodo reducer’s prepare callback to generate unique IDs for new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code uses functional components with hooks instead of class components  
  All components (e.g., Header, TodoItem, TodoList, Footer, Info, App) are implemented as functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains the same routing functionality with proper route handling  
  The application implements hash-based routing using a custom hook that listens for hash changes and dispatches the appropriate filter to Redux, ensuring routing functionality is maintained.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Redux store is properly configured with appropriate slices  
  The Redux store is configured in store.ts, combining the todos slice and adding a middleware to persist state changes, confirming proper configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the Redux provider is set up in the application entry point  
  In src/index.tsx, the <Provider> component wraps the App component, ensuring the Redux store is available across the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for all data structures  
  The Todo interface and FilterType are clearly defined in the types directory and are used consistently across the codebase.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows React best practices for component composition  
  Components are well-organized, each handling a single responsibility. The separation between UI components, Redux logic, and utilities follows best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles keyboard events properly  
  The Header component listens for the Enter key to add a todo, and the TodoItem component handles Enter (to complete editing) and Escape (to cancel editing) with appropriate logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application maintains local storage persistence if implemented  
  The localStorage utility functions (loadState and saveState) along with the middleware in the Redux store ensure todos are persisted to local storage.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  Although a runtime test is required to guarantee complete absence of errors and warnings, the code is structured to avoid common pitfalls. The try-catch blocks in localStorage functions add robustness. (Confidence slightly less than 100% because a live run is necessary to fully confirm no warnings/errors.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application implements proper error handling  
  Proper error handling is implemented in the localStorage utility functions using try-catch blocks to catch and log any errors during load/save operations.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the code is optimized with no unnecessary re-renders  
  The usage of memoized selectors via Redux Toolkit’s createSelector, along with functional components and hooks, suggests an optimized implementation. (Confidence is 90% because, without profiling, absolute confirmation is not possible.)
