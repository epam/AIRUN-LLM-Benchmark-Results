- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos  
  The Header component contains an h1 element with the text "todos" and an input field for adding new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos  
  The TodoList component renders a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and an unordered list that displays the todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button  
  Each TodoItem renders a checkbox (for toggling completion), a label (for displaying the title), and a button (for deletion).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode  
  In the TodoItem component, a double-click on the label triggers the editing mode by changing the component’s state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The application uses hash-based routing in the App component alongside Redux state (with setFilter) to filter todos by "all", "active", or "completed".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization  
  The Footer component displays the active todo count and uses the pluralize utility to correctly display “item” or “items” based on the count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter  
  The Footer component renders filter links, and the currently selected filter is highlighted using conditional classNames.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist  
  The Footer component renders a “Clear completed” button when the completed todos count is greater than zero.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter  
  In the Header component, entering text and pressing Enter dispatches an action to add a new todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos  
  The TodoItem component handles toggling individual todos by dispatching an action when the checkbox is changed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once  
  The TodoList component includes a toggle-all checkbox, and its change dispatches the toggleAll action to update the status of all todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management  
  In the TodoItem component, double-clicking enables editing mode; the input is automatically focused using a useRef and useEffect hook.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos  
  The TodoItem component includes a delete button (class “destroy”) that, when clicked, dispatches an action to delete that todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos  
  The Footer component provides a “Clear completed” button that dispatches an action to remove all completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status
