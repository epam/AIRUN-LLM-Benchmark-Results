# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present
- **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented
- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested
- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states
- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance

    The provided test suite does not include specific tests for large option sets to verify performance. This type of test would typically involve rendering the Select component with a large array of options (e.g., hundreds or thousands of items) and verifying that it handles the load efficiently. There are no tests that explicitly verify performance with large datasets.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering
- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations

    The test suite does not include any tests specifically for custom formatOptionLabel implementations. This would involve testing that the component correctly applies custom formatting functions to the option labels displayed in both the dropdown menu and the selected value area. No tests check this customization feature.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)
- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)
