# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist  
  The test suite includes tests such as "renders correctly with default props", as well as tests for rendering pre-selected values, loading indicators, and disabled states.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, enter, escape, backspace) are present  
  The tests simulate arrow key navigation, use of Enter and Escape keys, and even Backspace for multi-select scenarios.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)  
  The tests comprehensively cover mouse click interactions (opening the menu, selecting an option, clearing values). However, explicit tests for hover interactions are not present. This results in a slight decrease in confidence.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior  
  There is a test verifying the controlled component behavior by re-rendering the component with different value props.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values  
  The suite includes tests on selecting options, removing a value in multi-select mode, and clearing the input value via a clear indicator.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented  
  Tests are present for both opening the menu by clicking and closing it via actions such as clicking outside or pressing Escape.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality  
  The tests verify that when a user types into the combobox, the options get correctly filtered.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist  
  There are tests handling multi-select scenarios, such as selecting multiple options and removing individual selections.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility  
  The tests check for proper ARIA attributes including "aria-label", "aria-expanded", and "aria-controls" to ensure accessibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested  
  The suite includes tests to handle an empty options array, ensuring an appropriate "No options" message is displayed.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states  
  While the loading state is tested ("renders a loading indicator when isLoading is true"), there is no explicit test for error states, which is part of the evaluation requirements.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states  
  The tests cover disabled states both at the component level and for individual options within the list.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance  
  There are no tests addressing performance concerns or handling a large set of options. This aspect is missing in the suite.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested  
  The tests indirectly validate focus management through ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation. However, there is no explicit simulation of focus transfers or visual focus state testing, which slightly lowers confidence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering  
  The test suite clearly verifies that placeholders (e.g., "Select...") and selected values are rendered correctly.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations  
  There is no test provided to check custom formatting for option labels, which is one of the evaluation criteria.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)  
  The tests comprehensively check that these callback functions are called as expected during various interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)  
  The tests include custom implementations and validations for clear and loading indicators, ensuring proper behavior of these components.
