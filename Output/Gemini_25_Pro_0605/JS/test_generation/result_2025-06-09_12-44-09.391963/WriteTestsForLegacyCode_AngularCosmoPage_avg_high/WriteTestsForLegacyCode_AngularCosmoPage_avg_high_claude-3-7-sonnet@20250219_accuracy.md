# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)
  
  The solution uses Jasmine as the testing framework with Karma as the test runner, which are both standard testing tools for AngularJS applications. The configuration file `karma.conf.js` is included and properly configured to use Jasmine.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints
  
  The tests properly mock the `$resource` service through the `mockREST` object, which includes spies for all necessary methods (`save`, `update`, `delete`, `query`) and returns appropriately structured promises.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation
  
  All test suites use `beforeEach` hooks to set up the testing environment, including module loading, dependency injection, and mock setup. The `pageCtrl.spec.js` also includes an `afterEach` hook to clean up the jasmine clock.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls
  
  All HTTP requests are properly mocked through the `mockREST` object, which provides fake implementations of API methods that return promises instead of making real HTTP calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection
  
  The tests correctly use AngularJS's dependency injection system with the `inject` function to obtain services like `$q` and `$rootScope`. Dependencies are properly injected when creating controllers using `$controller`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations
  
  The tests handle promises correctly by using `$q.resolve`/`$q.reject` to create mock promises and calling `$rootScope.$apply()` to resolve them in the test assertions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies
  
  The solution properly uses Jasmine spies for all external dependencies including `$location`, `$translate`, localStorage methods, and REST API methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization
  
  All test suites follow a well-structured describe/it pattern, with nested describe blocks to organize related tests (e.g., "Initialization", "Page Deletion", "Page Data Manipulation").

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls
  
  The tests cover both success scenarios (like successful page saving) and error scenarios (like missing page type or URL) for API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate
  
  The tests simulate user interactions such as changing titles (`titleChange`), selecting tag suggestions (`selectSuggestion`), and deleting pages (`deletePage`).

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage
  
  The tests clean up after execution, particularly with the Jasmine clock in the `savePage` tests, where `jasmine.clock().install()` is paired with `jasmine.clock().uninstall()` in the `afterEach` hook.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested
  
  The test descriptions are clear and descriptive, explaining what functionality is being tested (e.g., "should auto-generate URL from title for a new page").

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible
  
  The tests focus on validating the expected outcomes of functions (like state changes, API calls with correct parameters, redirects) rather than internal implementation details.
