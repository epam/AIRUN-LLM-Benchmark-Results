# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources  
  All tests for the REST factory are present in "rest.factory.spec.js", and they verify that each expected endpoint exists and is configured properly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly  
  The "page.factory.spec.js" file confirms that each default property of the Page object is correctly initialized.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly  
  The "users.factory.spec.js" test suite validates that all properties of the Users factory are set to their default values.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods  
  The controller tests cover a wide range of functions (initialization, local version management, deletion, updates, tag autocomplete, and saving) of the pageCtrl, ensuring comprehensive coverage.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller  
  The tests under the "Initialization" suite properly verify that the pageCtrl controller initializes scope variables (like page.id, page.title, page.url) correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation  
  The test for titleChange checks that a new URL is auto-generated from the title when the page is new, confirming this functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction  
  There is no explicit "saveLocal" function tested. Although localStorage interactions are checked via the localVersion() and deleteNewerVersion() methods, an explicit test for a function named "saveLocal" is missing, leading to a mismatch with the evaluation step.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality  
  The "Tag Autocomplete" test suite invokes autocompleteTags, verifies the query for tag suggestions, and confirms the resulting suggestions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)  
  The tests for savePage include separate branches for error handling (missing page type or empty URL), creating a new page, and updating an existing page, covering multiple conditional paths.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types  
  The unit tests explicitly handle edge cases where the URL is empty or no page type is selected, ensuring these error conditions are tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly  
  The "Page Deletion" test suite confirms that all relevant REST delete methods are called and that the redirection and broadcasting occur as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions  
  The tests under "Initialization" and "Local Version Management" ensure that newer versions in localStorage are correctly detected, restored, and deleted, confirming proper handling of page versions.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components  
  The test suites are extensive and appear to cover a large portion of the functionality across factories and controllers. However, actual code coverage metrics are not provided, so confidence is slightly less than 100%.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling  
  The tests check that $rootScope.$broadcast is invoked with the correct events during operations such as deletion, saving, and local version restoration.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality  
  The tests utilize jasmine.clock() to simulate dates and verify that scheduleDate is correctly set and manipulated during controller initialization.
