- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up with TypeScript support

    The answer provides comprehensive setup instructions for Jest and React Testing Library with TypeScript. It includes proper installation commands for all necessary dependencies (`jest`, `ts-jest`, `@types/jest`, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `@testing-library/user-event`, `jest-environment-jsdom`). The configuration files are correctly structured with proper TypeScript support through `ts-jest` preset and appropriate compiler options in the `tsconfig.json` example.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test configuration files (jest.config.js, setupTests.ts) are properly configured

    Both configuration files are properly set up. The `jest.config.js` includes the correct preset ('ts-jest'), appropriate test environment ('jsdom'), setup files, module name mappers for CSS/assets, and TypeScript transformation settings. The `setupTests.ts` correctly imports '@testing-library/jest-dom' to extend Jest's matchers with DOM-specific ones.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use proper isolation with no dependencies between test cases

    All test files demonstrate proper test isolation. Each test file uses `beforeEach` to reset mocks and set up clean test environments. The tests don't share state between them, and each test case focuses on a specific behavior without depending on the results of other tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mocks are implemented for external dependencies and browser APIs (localStorage)

    Mocks are properly implemented throughout the test suite. The answer mocks the `Utils` module in the `todoModel.test.ts` file, particularly for `store` and `uuid` functions. It also properly handles localStorage in the `utils.test.ts` file by clearing it before each test with `localStorage.clear()`. The mock for the Router is also properly implemented in the global settings.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that component lifecycle methods are properly tested

    Component lifecycle behaviors are properly tested, particularly in the React component tests (`app.test.tsx`, `todoItem.test.tsx`). The tests verify component mounting, state changes, and proper cleanup. The answer correctly tests component behavior after state changes and user interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify both happy paths and edge cases/error conditions

    The test suite covers both happy paths and edge cases extensively. For example, in `todoModel.test.ts`, it tests both adding and removing todos. In `todoItem.test.tsx`, it tests the editing mode with both valid text entry and empty text. In `utils.test.ts`, it tests the store function with both existing and non-existent keys. The tests handle various edge cases like empty arrays, single versus multiple items, and invalid inputs.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use proper describe/it blocks structure for readability

    All test files follow a clear and hierarchical structure using `describe` and `it` blocks. The tests are properly nested with descriptive names that clearly explain what is being tested. For example, in `utils.test.ts`, functions are grouped in separate `describe` blocks, and each test case is in an `it` block with a descriptive name.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm assertions include meaningful error messages

    Most assertions are well-structured and would provide meaningful error messages if they failed. However, the tests don't explicitly include custom error messages in the assertions (e.g., `expect(result).toEqual(expected, "Custom error message")`). This isn't strictly necessary with modern testing frameworks, but explicit error messages can sometimes make debugging easier.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that event handling tests correctly simulate user interactions

    The tests properly simulate user interactions using the `@testing-library/user-event` library. The tests include simulations of clicking, typing, keyboard events (Enter, Escape), double-clicking, and focusing/blurring elements. For example, in `todoItem.test.tsx`, it simulates double-clicking to enter edit mode, typing to change the todo text, and pressing Enter to save.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify tests achieve minimum 80% code coverage across all components

    While the tests are comprehensive and cover all components and functionality, the answer doesn't explicitly mention or show code coverage reports. However, based on the thoroughness of the tests provided, it's reasonable to infer that they would achieve high code coverage. The tests cover all public methods and components, including edge cases and different states.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for UI components verify proper rendering based on props/state

    The UI component tests thoroughly verify rendering based on different props and state. For example, in `footer.test.tsx`, it verifies the rendering of different counts and filter states. In `todoItem.test.tsx`, it verifies rendering in both normal and editing modes. The tests also verify CSS classes applied based on component state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for data management verify proper state updates

    The tests for data management components, particularly in `todoModel.test.ts`, thoroughly verify state updates. The tests check that adding, toggling, and removing todos properly updates the model state. They also verify that subscribers are informed of changes and that the storage is updated.
