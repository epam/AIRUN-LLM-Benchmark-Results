# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering  
  The app.test.tsx file contains tests that confirm the header and input field are rendered, which verifies component rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos  
  The test "should add a new todo when enter is pressed" clearly demonstrates the functionality of adding a new todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos  
  The test "should toggle all todos" is present and validates that the toggle-all functionality works as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos  
  Tests are provided for filtering active and completed todos, ensuring that the filtering functionality is verified.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  There is a test for clearing completed todos which checks that the onClearCompleted function is called accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering  
  The tests in todoItem.test.tsx include rendering of a todo item and a completed todo item, confirming proper rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos  
  Tests for toggling (via checkbox click), destroying (via the destroy button), and editing (via double-click and keyboard events) are implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events  
  The editing mode tests cover handling of keyboard events such as Enter and Escape, as well as onBlur events.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts  
  The footer.test.tsx file tests rendering with both singular and plural counts for active todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation  
  The tests validate that the correct filter ("All", "Active", "Completed") is highlighted depending on the nowShowing prop.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  There are tests that verify the presence and functionality of the "Clear completed" button, confirming correct behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos  
  The todoModel.test.ts file includes tests for adding a todo, toggling individual and all todos, saving updates, and destroying todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions  
  A test is present for the inform function which ensures that subscribers are notified and localStorage is updated.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The test "should clear completed todos" confirms that only active todos remain after clearing completed ones.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation  
  The uuid test checks that the generated ID matches the UUID format and that two successive calls produce different IDs.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality  
  Tests for singular and plural word responses (for counts 1, 0, and greater than 1) have been correctly implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations  
  The store tests validate storing data to localStorage, retrieving data, and return behavior when key doesnâ€™t exist.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function  
  Tests for merging multiple objects and handling empty objects confirm that the extend functionality works as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx  
  React component tests are in files with the .test.tsx extension (e.g., app.test.tsx, footer.test.tsx, todoItem.test.tsx), while non-component files (e.g., todoModel, utils) use the appropriate .test.ts extension. This follows a consistent and accepted naming convention.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data  
  Sample todo data is provided in both todoModel.test.ts and app.test.tsx; these fixtures are used consistently throughout the tests.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented  
  The app.test.tsx file simulates filtering by manually setting state (mimicking routing changes) and the jest configuration includes a mock for a global Router. Although the routing tests use a state manipulation approach rather than full router navigation, the intended functionality is adequately verified. (Slightly less than 100% because the routing is simulated via state changes rather than an integrated routing library test.)
