- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the error handling and display mechanisms are correctly documented.  
  The documentation details how errors are displayed below form fields using components like FormGroup and explains both synchronous and asynchronous error handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that any code examples provided are syntactically correct and demonstrate proper component usage.  
  The provided code snippets are in valid JSX/React syntax and clearly illustrate how the components should be used.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that accessibility features are accurately documented with correct ARIA roles and attributes.
