# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The application uses Axios to fetch character data from the SWAPI API endpoint (`https://swapi.dev/api/people`) and renders the characters in a list using the `map` function.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The application maintains a `loading` state variable that is set to `true` initially and during API calls. When this state is true, it renders a "Loading characters..." message to the user.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The application maps over the entire `characters` array and renders each character in the list using `characters.map((character) => <li key={character.name}>{character.name}</li>)`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  The provided code does not contain any search functionality, filters, or user input fields. It simply displays the raw list of characters fetched from the API.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character is displayed correctly with their name in a list item: `<li key={character.name}>{character.name}</li>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The solution includes initial setup instructions that clearly use Create React App with TypeScript template:
  ```bash
  npx create-react-app swapi-character-list --template typescript
  ```
  
  The package.json provided also matches what would be generated by Create React App.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The application uses three state variables:
  - `characters` for storing the character data
  - `loading` for tracking when data is being loaded
  - `error` for storing any error that occurs

  These states are properly used and updated during the data fetching process.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each list item has a unique key based on the character's name: `<li key={character.name}>`.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  The application handles loading and error states well, but there is no explicit handling for an empty characters array (if the API were to return no results). In practice, this is unlikely to occur with the SWAPI API, but for complete robustness, an explicit check like `characters.length === 0` could have been included.
