# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The code fetches data using Axios and maps the returned characters to a list in the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  A loading message ("Loading characters...") is rendered while the API call is in progress.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  Once the API call is successfully completed, the characters are rendered in an unordered list.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  The provided code does not contain any search functionality or input fields for filtering the list.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each character is rendered in a list item using its name, ensuring proper display of the character name.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The instructions include using Create React App with the TypeScript template, confirming the structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The application uses separate state variables (characters, loading, and error) to manage data and UI states appropriately.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  Each list item uses the characterâ€™s name as a key. While names are likely unique in the SWAPI data, using an ID (if available) would be more robust.  
  (Confidence reduced to 90% because reliance solely on names assumes that no duplicates exist.)

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  The code does not explicitly handle the case where the API returns an empty list. If the characters array is empty, the UI will render an empty list rather than displaying a message (e.g., "No characters found"). This may not meet the requirement for handling empty data states.
