# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  Although the code does not explicitly state the React version, the use of React 18 practices (via create‑react‑app with the TypeScript template) and standard functional patterns gives confidence that React 18.x is intended. However, without an explicit version indicator, absolute certainty is slightly diminished.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  The code defines interfaces (e.g. Option, SearchableSelectProps) and uses TypeScript features throughout, ensuring proper type safety.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  A CSS file is provided (named "index.css" in the evaluation, though the component itself imports "SearchableSelect.css"). This minor naming discrepancy does not affect the existence or quality of the styling. Overall, the styling is there as intended.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  The code is clean and well-commented. Although it mentions that the highlighting logic is "omitted for brevity," it does not include any lingering TODO comments that would impair production readiness.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  The component uses useState hooks to manage both the dropdown’s open/closed state and the current search term, as well as relying on props for the selected value. The state management is appropriate and follows React best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  The component accepts props for options, value, onChange, and placeholder. This makes it easily configurable and reusable in different contexts.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  The component provides keyboard handling for Enter, Escape, and arrow keys. Note that the arrow key functionality for highlighting is only indicated (with a placeholder comment) and not fully implemented. This slight shortcoming leads to a small reduction in confidence.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  The component correctly uses useRef for both the dropdown container and the select button, ensuring proper interactions with the DOM (such as focusing when needed and detecting outside clicks).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  The useEffect hook sets focus appropriately when the dropdown is opened, and click‑outside handling ensures that focus and state are managed correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  The component uses aria-haspopup, aria-expanded, role attributes on list items, and aria-label on the search input. These measures ensure it is accessible to screen readers and aligns with accessibility guidelines.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  Although we cannot execute the code here to check for runtime console errors or warnings, the code appears sound and standard. Minor uncertainties remain since dynamic behavior (or potential dependency issues in callbacks) is not fully verifiable without running the component.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  The component uses useCallback for event handlers and manages state appropriately. However, note that the handleKeyDown callback references the isOpen state but does not include isOpen in its dependency array. While this does not appear to cause extra re-renders, it could risk using stale state under certain conditions. Overall, the implementation seems efficient with only a minor caveat, leading to a high—but not perfect—confidence level.
