# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component returns a container that conditionally displays a dropdown section. Although it does not explicitly assign a role such as "listbox" to the dropdown container, it does render the visual UI elements needed for a dropdown select.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  The code clearly renders an <input> element inside the dropdown area when it is open, which is used for searching within the options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The implementation uses a callback (handleOptionClick) on each option that triggers onChange with the selected value and closes the dropdown, satisfying single selection support.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  Although the onKeyDown handler includes cases for 'ArrowDown' and 'ArrowUp', the actual highlighting and navigation logic is only indicated as a placeholder. This incomplete implementation does not fully support keyboard navigation.  
  Explanation: The comments hint at where logic should be implemented, but since the actual selection/highlight movement is not there, this step does not fully meet the requirement.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  In the handleKeyDown callback, when the 'Enter' key is pressed while the dropdown is open, the code simply closes the dropdown without selecting a specific (highlighted) item. Thus, selection via Enter is not fully implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  The onKeyDown logic toggles the dropdown state with the Enter key when the component is focused, which fulfills this requirement.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  The code includes a useEffect that focuses the select button when the dropdown opens; however, it does not explicitly reset focus back to the button when the dropdown closes.  
  Explanation: Although clicking to close the dropdown might naturally leave focus on the button, there is no explicit logic ensuring that focus is restored, so this requirement is only partially met.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  The handleOptionClick function, triggered by a click on a list item, sets the state to close the dropdown, which meets this requirement.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  The component does not implement keyboard selection for list items (i.e. there is no event handler on the list items to capture an Enter key press for selection).  
  Explanation: Although the overall key handling exists, the detailed logic for keyboard-based selection of an option is missing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  The onKeyDown handler checks for the 'Escape' key and closes the dropdown accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  A useEffect hook sets up an event listener on the document that properly closes the dropdown when a click occurs outside of the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  The onKeyDown logic correctly opens the dropdown when the Enter key is pressed and the dropdown is not already open.
