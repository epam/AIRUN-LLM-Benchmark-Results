# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The code uses axios to fetch data from `https://swapi.dev/api/people` and maps through the returned characters to display them in an unordered list.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The application includes a loading state that shows "Loading characters..." text while fetching data. The loading state is initialized as true and set to false after the API call completes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The code maps through all characters in the response data and renders each one as a list item: `{characters.map((character) => (<li key={character.name}>{character.name}</li>))}`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  The code doesn't contain any search functionality, filters, or user input fields. It's a simple display of characters from the API.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character is displayed in a list item that shows the character's name: `<li key={character.name}>{character.name}</li>`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The code includes setup instructions that use Create React App with TypeScript: `npx create-react-app swapi-character-list --template typescript`, and the package.json file is consistent with a CRA-generated structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The application correctly uses useState hooks to manage three states:
  - `characters` for the character data
  - `loading` for tracking API call status
  - `error` for handling error messages

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each list item has a key attribute set to the character's name: `<li key={character.name}>{character.name}</li>`

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  The application handles loading and error states explicitly, but there's no specific handling for an empty results array. The code will render an empty list if the API returns no characters, which is acceptable but not optimal. A better approach would be to check for empty results and display a message.
