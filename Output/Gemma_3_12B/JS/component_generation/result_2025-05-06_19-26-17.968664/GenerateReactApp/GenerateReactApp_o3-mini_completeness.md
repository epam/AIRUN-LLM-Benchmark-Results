# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The code fetches data from the SWAPI endpoint and maps over the returned characters to display their names in a list. This confirms that the application successfully displays character data.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  When the data is being fetched, the component returns a div displaying "Loading characters...". This acts as a visual loading indicator while the API call is in progress.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  The use of the Array.map function on the fetched data ensures that every character from the API response results in a corresponding list item in the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  The implementation strictly fetches and displays character data without any additional functionality such as search fields or input components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each character's name is used as the content within list items, ensuring that the proper information is presented to the user.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The provided package.json and the instructions indicate that the project was set up using Create React App with the TypeScript template.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The component utilizes React’s useState hook to manage the loading, error, and characters states, and the state transitions are appropriately handled during the data fetching process.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  The list items are provided with a key based on character.name. While this is acceptable assuming that the names are unique, there is a slight possibility of duplicate names in some datasets. Therefore, the confidence is set to 90%.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  The code does not explicitly display a message when the characters list is empty—it shows an empty list if no characters are fetched. This might be acceptable in many cases, but some might expect an explicit "No characters found" message. Because the empty state still results in a valid UI render (albeit empty), this step is marked as a pass with 80% confidence. If user feedback for an empty list were required, additional handling might be needed.
