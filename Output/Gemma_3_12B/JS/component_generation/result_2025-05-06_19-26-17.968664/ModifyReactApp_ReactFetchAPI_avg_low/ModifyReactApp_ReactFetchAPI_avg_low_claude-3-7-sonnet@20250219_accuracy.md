# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type
- **Fail** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls

    The provided code does not implement debouncing for search API calls. The search query state is directly connected to the useEffect hook through its dependency array, meaning every keystroke will trigger an immediate API call. A proper debounce implementation would delay the API call until the user stops typing for a specified period (300-500ms).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses
- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters
- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback
- **Fail** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing

    The code triggers API calls immediately after each keystroke since `searchQuery` is in the useEffect dependency array without any debouncing mechanism. This can lead to excessive API calls as the user types each character of their search term.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices
- **Pass** (90%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code

    While the code does not have unused imports or commented-out code, it contains console.log statements for error messages which would typically be replaced with proper user notifications in production code as mentioned in the comments.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns
