# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The code includes an input element with an onChange handler that updates the search query and a useMemo hook that filters the characters based on the search query.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  The component displays a "Loading..." message while the loading state is true during the API request.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  The useEffect hook is triggered on component mount with the default empty string value for searchQuery, ensuring that characters are fetched initially.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  As the user types, the onChange handler updates the searchQuery state, and the useMemo hook recalculates the filteredCharacters array accordingly, ensuring dynamic updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  The code includes a conditional render that displays a "No characters found." message when the filtered characters array is empty and the search query is not an empty string.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The input field has a set maxWidth and styling that adapts to different screen sizes, thereby providing a responsive design.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  Once the API request completes and the loading state is set to false, the component renders the list of characters based on the search results.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  While error handling via tryâ€¦catch and console.error is present, the code does not implement an explicit Error Boundary component to catch and gracefully handle errors within the React component tree, which is considered a best practice in production environments.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The code defines the necessary TypeScript interfaces for Character and the component props (CharacterListProps).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The code preserves the original functionality such as fetching data, displaying a loading indicator, and presenting the character list, while also integrating the new search feature seamlessly.
