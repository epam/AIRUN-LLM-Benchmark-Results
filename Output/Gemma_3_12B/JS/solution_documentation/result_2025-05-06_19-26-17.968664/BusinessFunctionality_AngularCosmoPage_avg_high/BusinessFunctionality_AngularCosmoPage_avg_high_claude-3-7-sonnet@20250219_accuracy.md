# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies the application as an Angular.js application for web content management
  
  The documentation clearly identifies the application as an Angular.js application for web content management in the first sentence and throughout the document. It also correctly describes it as a Content Management System (CMS) focused on managing web pages.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the documentation accurately describes the REST factory for backend communication
  
  The documentation mentions the use of REST for backend communication, noting "RESTful API" and specifically mentioning "REST.content.save", "REST.content.query", "REST.content.update", and "REST.content.delete" endpoints. It also correctly notes the use of Angular's $resource service for API interaction. However, there isn't a detailed breakdown of the REST factory structure itself, which is why I'm not 100% confident.

- **Pass** (80%): Validate that the documentation correctly explains the Page factory for storing global page variables
  
  The documentation refers to page management and how page data is handled, but doesn't explicitly name or detail a "Page factory" for storing global page variables. It describes page-related functionality but not specifically in the context of a factory pattern, reducing my confidence in this assessment.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that the documentation accurately describes the Users factory for storing current user data
  
  The documentation mentions a "Users factory" and implies it's used for user authentication and role-based access control, but doesn't provide detailed information about how it stores current user data, which reduces my confidence in this assessment.

- **Pass** (85%): Confirm that the documentation correctly explains the page controller functionality
  
  The documentation describes many functions that would typically be handled by a page controller, including editing, saving, deleting, and duplicating pages. However, it doesn't explicitly label these as controller functions or fully describe the controller architecture, which slightly reduces my confidence.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation accurately explains the page creation and editing process
  
  The documentation thoroughly explains the page creation and editing process, detailing the form fields (type, title, description, tags, URL, publish status), the workflow steps, and the save functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately describes the local storage recovery mechanism for unsaved changes
  
  The documentation explicitly mentions the use of localStorage for temporary storage of unsaved changes and includes it in both the technical constraints section and data management approach section.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation correctly explains the version comparison and management features
  
  The documentation accurately describes the version control feature, including the "newer version" alert, which provides options to discard, compare, or use a newer version of the page. It also mentions the ability to revert to previous versions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation accurately describes the page deletion workflow
  
  The documentation correctly describes the page deletion workflow, mentioning the delete action button, the confirmation step before deletion, and the API call to REST.content.delete.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately explains the auto-URL generation from title functionality
  
  The documentation correctly explains that URLs are automatically generated from page titles with sanitization, mentioning this in both the user interaction patterns section and the business rules section.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation correctly describes the tag autocompletion and suggestion system
  
  The documentation accurately describes the tag autocompletion and suggestion system, mentioning that tag suggestions are displayed as the user types and that there is a text input with autocomplete for tags.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation accurately explains the publication scheduling system
  
  The documentation correctly explains the publication scheduling system, noting that pages can be published immediately, scheduled for later, or kept as drafts. It also mentions the schedule date datetime picker as part of the form fields.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the documentation accurately describes the handling of page revisions and extras
  
  The documentation mentions version control and the ability to revert to previous versions of pages. It also references "page.html" which contains a newer version alert with options to discard, compare, or use a newer version. However, it doesn't go into extensive detail about how revisions are tracked or what "extras" might entail, which is why I'm not 100% confident.
