- **Fail** (80%): Ensure the documentation describes the page creation workflow
  
  While the documentation mentions page creation as a feature and notes that "New pages are created via API calls to the `REST.content.save` endpoint," it doesn't provide a detailed workflow for page creation.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the documentation explains the page editing workflow
  
  The documentation describes a workflow: "User navigates to a page (either existing or new). User edits the page's title, description, tags, URL, and publish status. User clicks 'Save' to persist changes."
