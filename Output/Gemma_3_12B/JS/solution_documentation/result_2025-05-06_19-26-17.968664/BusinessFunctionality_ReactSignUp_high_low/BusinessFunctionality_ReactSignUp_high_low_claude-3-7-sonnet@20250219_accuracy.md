- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately describes the validation rules for name (3-60 characters), email (valid format), and password (minimum 6 characters)
  
  The validation constraints are accurately described under the "Business Logic and Rules" section, stating that name must be between 3-60 characters, email must be valid, and password must be at least 6 characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation correctly explains the asynchronous validation for checking existing usernames and emails
  
  The documentation thoroughly explains the asynchronous validation process, including the `asyncValidate` function that "checks if the provided name and email are already in use by making API calls."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately describes the form submission process and API interaction
  
  The documentation clearly explains that form submission triggers the `handleSubmit` function which makes an API call via `api.signup` to create the user account, and upon success dispatches a `signupComplete` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation correctly explains the Redux integration for state management
  
  The documentation accurately describes the Redux integration throughout, mentioning "Redux Form Integration," explaining how user input flows through redux-form, and how the application uses Redux for state management with dispatched actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation accurately describes the form feedback mechanisms for validation errors
  
  The documentation correctly explains that error messages are displayed below the corresponding input fields using "help-block" classes, and that the Input component uses feedback styling based on field status.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately describes the FormGroup component's role in displaying validation feedback
  
  The documentation correctly describes the FormGroup component as "a reusable component for rendering form fields with validation feedback" and explains that it "displays the input value and error messages based on the field object's properties."

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the documentation correctly explains the Promise-based architecture for parallel validation checks
  
  The documentation mentions that the asyncValidate function performs two asynchronous API calls, but doesn't explicitly state that they might be conducted in parallel using Promises. However, it does imply this architecture by discussing the asynchronous nature of the validation.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation accurately describes the user flow from form completion to successful signup
  
  The documentation provides a detailed step-by-step description of the user flow from entering information to successful signup under the "User Flow" subsection of "User Experience Design."

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the documentation accurately explains the error handling during form submission
  
  The documentation mentions that "if validation fails, error messages are displayed below the corresponding input fields" but doesn't go into extensive detail about error handling specifically during the submission process itself.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation correctly identifies the document title management using react-document-title
