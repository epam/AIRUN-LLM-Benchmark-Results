    While the document mentions pluralization in the "Core Components and Relationships" section where it states "`Utils` (Class): A utility class containing helper functions like generating UUIDs, pluralizing strings...", it doesn't explicitly detail how the item/items text is pluralized based on count in the UI. It mentions the functionality exists but doesn't elaborate on its implementation or how it appears to users.
