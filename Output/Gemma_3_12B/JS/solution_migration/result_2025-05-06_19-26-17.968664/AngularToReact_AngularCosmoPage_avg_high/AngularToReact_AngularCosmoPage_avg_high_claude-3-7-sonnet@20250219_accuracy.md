# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components
  
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately
  
- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation
  
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization
  
- **Pass** (80%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization
  
  The answer mentions code splitting as a key consideration using React.lazy and Suspense, but doesn't provide a concrete implementation example in the code snippets. It's referred to conceptually but not demonstrated in practice.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations
  
  The answer mentions using React.memo in the "Key Considerations & Optimizations" section, but doesn't provide a concrete example of its implementation in the code snippets.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks
  
  While there is an example of useEffect with an empty dependency array in the PageEditor component, there aren't multiple examples showing different dependency array use cases to fully demonstrate understanding of this concept.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models
  
- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks
