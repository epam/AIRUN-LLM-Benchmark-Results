# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (80%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented

    While the answer outlines the structure for state management using Redux and shows sample code for setting a page title, it doesn't explicitly demonstrate complete implementation of page create, update, delete, and duplicate functionality. The Redux slice shown only has `setPage` and `setTitle` reducers, but missing specific actions for create, update, delete, and duplicate operations. I'm 80% confident because the answer provides a framework but not the complete implementation.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present

    The answer doesn't include any code or specific mention of page type selection functionality. The data model includes a `type` field in the Page interface, but there's no component or form element explicitly shown for selecting page types. The PageEditor component example only shows a title input field.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists

    There is no implementation or mention of URL auto-generation from the title. The PageEditor component only shows a basic input for the title without any logic to generate a URL from it.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented

    The answer doesn't include any implementation or mention of tag management with autocomplete suggestions. No UI components or logic for handling tags are present in the provided code samples.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available

    The answer doesn't include any implementation of publish status options. While the Page interface has `published` and `published_date` fields, there's no UI or logic shown for handling different publishing statuses.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented

    The answer doesn't include any implementation for scheduled publishing functionality. There's no date picker component or logic for handling scheduled publishing dates shown in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present

    While the answer includes basic local storage utility functions (`setLocalStorageItem` and `getLocalStorageItem`), it doesn't implement version comparison or restoration features. There's no mechanism shown for tracking versions or restoring previous states.

- **Fail** (95%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented

    The answer doesn't include a notification system implementation. There are some error console logs in the API service, but no UI notification system for displaying success/error messages to users is shown.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present

    The answer doesn't include any form validation logic. The PageEditor component example shows a basic input field without any validation for required fields.

- **Pass** (70%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled

    The answer includes an API service structure using Axios and shows an example of `fetchBlocks`. It mentions "Implement other API methods similarly" suggesting an approach for handling other endpoints. However, without seeing the original code's endpoints and a more complete implementation, I can't be 100% confident that all endpoints would be properly handled.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented

    The answer doesn't include any implementation for extras management. While the Page interface has an `extras` field, there's no UI or logic shown for managing these extras.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained

    The answer doesn't include any implementation or mention of revision history functionality. There's no code or approach outlined for tracking or displaying revision history.

- **Pass** (80%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components

    The answer shows a structure with separate folders for interfaces, store, services, and components, demonstrating a separation of concerns. The API service is separated from components, and Redux is used to manage state. However, the example doesn't fully demonstrate complete separation in a complex application.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved

    The answer includes a basic setup for internationalization using react-i18next, showing how to initialize i18n and mentions translation files. This suggests a framework for preserving translation functionality, though the integration with components isn't fully demonstrated.

- **Pass** (70%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters

    The answer includes React Router setup which could maintain URL structure, but doesn't specifically address preserving exact URL structures and parameters from the original Angular application. Without seeing the original URL structure, I can't be 100% confident they would be maintained.
