# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass** (90%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props  
   Although TypeScript is used throughout (with interfaces for data models and React functional components typed as React.FC), some properties (like “extras” and “misc” defined as any) and certain utility functions lack stricter typing. This minor shortcoming lowers the confidence slightly.

2. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management  
   The Redux slice in pageSlice.ts clearly uses createSlice from Redux Toolkit to manage state.

3. **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components  
   All provided components (e.g., PageEditor and App) are implemented as functional components.

4. **Pass** (90%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately  
   The code demonstrates the proper use of useState and useEffect. Although useCallback and useMemo are mentioned as performance optimizations in the outline, they do not appear in the code. Their absence may be acceptable depending on the complexity of the components, so the step is marked as passed with slightly lower confidence.

5. **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource  
   The API service uses axios in place of Angular’s $resource.

6. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components  
   The PageEditor component uses controlled input elements with value and onChange handlers.

7. **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation  
   React Router is implemented in App.tsx using the BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route components.

8. **Pass** (90%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization  
   The implementation uses react-i18next for i18n. However, there is a slight concern: the languageDetector is referenced but not explicitly imported in the snippet, which slightly reduces the confidence.

9. **Fail** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization  
   While the outline mentions code splitting (via React.lazy and Suspense), the provided code does not show any code splitting implementation.

10. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations  
    No usage of React.memo is present in the given component implementations, even though it is recommended for expensive rendering scenarios.

11. **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks  
    The useEffect usage in PageEditor includes an appropriate dependency array (empty, to run on mount).

12. **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models  
    Interfaces such as Page and User are defined, enabling strong typing for the data models.

13. **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state  
    The code uses useSelector in PageEditor to access the Redux state.

14. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations  
    The Redux slice includes action creators (e.g., setPage and setTitle) for managing state updates.

15. **Fail** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks  
    Although utility functions for setting and getting local storage items are provided, they are not implemented as React hooks or integrated via hook patterns, which does not fully meet the evaluation criteria.
