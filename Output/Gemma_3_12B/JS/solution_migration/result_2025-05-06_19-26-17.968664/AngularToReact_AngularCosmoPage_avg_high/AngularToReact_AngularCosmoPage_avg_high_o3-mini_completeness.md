# Evaluation Report

1. **Fail** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
   The provided answer does not include explicit implementations or code snippets for creating, updating, deleting, or duplicating pages.

2. **Fail** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
   There is no code or explanation demonstrating how a user might select a page type in the migration plan.

3. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
   The answer includes a title field in the interface and UI but does not implement or describe auto-generation of a URL from the title.

4. **Fail** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
   The answer does not show any implementation or discussion regarding tag management or autocomplete suggestion features.

5. **Fail** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
   While the Page interface contains a field for published status, there is no functionality provided (or mentioned) for managing multiple publish states like draft or schedule.

6. **Fail** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
   Even though the interface includes a published_date field, there is no scheduling functionality or UI behavior to manage scheduled publishing.

7. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
   The provided local storage utilities only set and get values without handling version comparison or restoration features.

8. **Fail** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
   There is no implementation or discussion of a notification system for handling feedback (success/error messages) in the migration plan.

9. **Fail** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
   The answer does not include any form validation logic for required fields such as URL or page type, nor does it mention validation behaviors.

10. **Fail** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
    Only a single API endpoint for fetching blocks is shown. There is no evidence that all API endpoints from the original Angular code are implemented.

11. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
    Although the Page interface includes an extras field, there is no functionality or additional code demonstrating its management.

12. **Fail** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
    Revision history is not mentioned or implemented anywhere in the migration outline.

13. **Pass** (90%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
    The answer demonstrates a modular organization (with separate folders for interfaces, store, components, services, utils, etc.), though the separation could be further refined. The slight uncertainty (10%) is due to the high-level nature of the example rather than a full-fledged project structure.

14. **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
    The inclusion of an i18n setup using react-i18next confirms that translation functionality is taken into account.

15. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
    The provided routing code shows a basic setup with "/" and "/new" routes, which does not ensure that the original URL structure and parameters from the Angular code are maintained.
