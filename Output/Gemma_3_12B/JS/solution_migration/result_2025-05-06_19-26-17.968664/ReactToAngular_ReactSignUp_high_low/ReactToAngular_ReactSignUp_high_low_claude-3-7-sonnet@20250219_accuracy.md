# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling
  
  The component clearly uses Angular Reactive Forms as indicated by the imports (`FormBuilder, FormGroup, Validators`) and implementation in the constructor where a form group is created using the form builder with appropriate controls.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)
  
  The validators are correctly implemented in the form group creation:
  ```typescript
  this.signupForm = this.fb.group({
    name: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3), Validators.maxLength(60)]],
    email: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.email]],
    password: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.minLength(6)]],
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (80%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use
  
  The component includes methods `isNameAvailable` and `isEmailAvailable` that call the auth service to check availability, but these methods are not actually used in the form validation setup. They exist but aren't connected to the form validation, which is why this is not a 100% pass.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched
  
  The FormGroupComponent template attempts to use a `[hasFeedback]` directive, but there's no evidence this directive is defined or imported. Additionally, the template tries to access `field.error` but should be accessing `field.errors` (plural) according to Angular's AbstractControl interface.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions
  
  The `onSubmit` method correctly extracts form values, calls the auth service's signup method, and dispatches a `signupComplete` action with the result upon success.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails
  
  In the FormGroupComponent, there's incorrect implementation. It uses `field.error` instead of `field.errors?.[errorType]` and doesn't handle different types of validation errors with specific messages.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service
  
  There's an attempt to use a title service with `title$: Observable<string> = this.titleService.getTitle();` but `titleService` is not defined in the constructor. Additionally, the `utils.ts` file has a UtilsService with a Title service, but it's not properly injected or used in the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management
  
  The component imports `Store` from '@ngrx/store' and dispatches actions (`signupComplete`), confirming it uses NgRx for state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress
  
  The submit button has a `[disabled]="submitting"` binding, and the `submitting` flag is properly managed in the `onSubmit` method.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses
  
  The `onSubmit` method has a try-catch-finally block that correctly handles both success (dispatching an action) and error (setting an error message) cases, and resets the submission state in both scenarios.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management
  
  The component generally follows good structure with proper separation of concerns, but the `ngOnInit()` method is empty, which raises questions about why it's implemented. Also, the async validation methods exist but aren't used.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises
  
  In the `onSubmit` method, the code uses `.toPromise()` on the observable returned by the auth service's signup method, which is not the recommended approach in modern Angular. Observables should be used directly with async pipe or subscription management.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements
  
  The form validation error display logic in the FormGroupComponent is incorrect and simplistic. It only checks for `field.error` without specific error types or tailored messages based on validation failure type.
