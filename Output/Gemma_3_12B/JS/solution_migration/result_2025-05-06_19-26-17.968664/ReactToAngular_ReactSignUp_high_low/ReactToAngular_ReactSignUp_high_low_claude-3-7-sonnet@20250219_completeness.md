# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component includes all three required form fields: name, email, and password
  
  The signup component clearly includes all three required form fields:
  - Name field: `<input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Name" [formControl]="signupForm.get('name')">`
  - Email field: `<input type="email" class="form-control" placeholder="Email address" [formControl]="signupForm.get('email')">`
  - Password field: `<input type="password" class="form-control" placeholder="Password" [formControl]="signupForm.get('password')">`

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page includes a heading 'Join PodBaby today.'
  
  The signup.component.html file contains the heading: `<h2 class="mb-3">Join PodBaby today.</h2>`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a lead paragraph about membership benefits
  
  The page includes the lead paragraph: `<p class="lead">As a member you can subscribe to podcast feeds and keep track of your favorite episodes.</p>`

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form includes a submit button with appropriate styling and icon
  
  The form includes a submit button with appropriate Bootstrap styling (btn btn-primary) and an icon component:
  ```html
  <button
    type="submit"
    class="btn btn-primary form-control"
    [disabled]="submitting"
  >
    <icon icon="sign-in"></icon> Signup
  </button>
  ```

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the page includes a link to the login page with appropriate text
  
  The code uses `<router-link to="/login/">Already a member? Log in here.</router-link>` which is Vue.js syntax, not Angular. In Angular, the correct syntax would be `<a routerLink="/login/">Already a member? Log in here.</a>` or using the standalone RouterLink import properly.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the FormGroup component or equivalent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display
  
  While the FormGroupComponent is defined, there are inconsistencies in its implementation:
  1. The component has both a template inline and a separate HTML file, which is conflicting
  2. In the component use, it shows `[field]="signupForm.get('name')"` but in the component definition it's trying to access `field.error` which doesn't exist in AbstractControl (should be `field.errors`)

- **Fail** (90%): Verify the Icon component or equivalent is implemented for the signup button
  
  The IconComponent is defined, but there's inconsistency between the TypeScript file (which has an inline template) and the separate HTML file. Additionally, a proper implementation would likely use Font Awesome or another icon library rather than just printing the icon name as text.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all validation rules are implemented (name length, email format, password length)
  
  All validation rules are implemented in the form group creation:
  ```typescript
  this.signupForm = this.fb.group({
    name: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3), Validators.maxLength(60)]],
    email: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.email]],
    password: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.minLength(6)]],
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure asynchronous validation for both name and email uniqueness is implemented
  
  Methods for async validation are defined (`isNameAvailable` and `isEmailAvailable`), but they are not properly connected to the form validation. They exist in the component but aren't being used as async validators in the FormGroup construction.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API integration is complete with proper error handling
  
  The signup API integration is complete with proper error handling in the `onSubmit()` method, including:
  - Setting `submitting` state
  - Clearing previous error messages
  - Using try/catch/finally blocks
  - Storing the successful result via NgRx
  - Displaying error messages when the API call fails

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form layout matches the horizontal form structure specified
  
  The form has the `form-horizontal` class applied: `<form class="form-horizontal" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()" [formGroup]="signupForm">`

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page has proper document title setting functionality
  
  The component imports and tries to use a title service with `title$: Observable<string> = this.titleService.getTitle();`, but this service is not injected in the constructor. Additionally, the Utils service implementation is incorrect as it expects a parameter but the component doesn't provide one.
