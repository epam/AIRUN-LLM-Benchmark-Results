# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The SignupComponent imports FormBuilder and FormGroup from @angular/forms and properly builds a reactive form.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The component builds the form using Validators.required, Validators.minLength (and maxLength for name), and Validators.email.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  Although the component defines methods isNameAvailable and isEmailAvailable which call the service endpoints, these functions are not integrated as asynchronous validators into the reactive form controls. Without being attached to the form controls via async validators, the asynchronous validation is not effectively utilized.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The custom form-group component attempts to display error messages with an expression “field.error” when touched. In Angular, validation errors are stored in an “errors” object (i.e. field.errors) rather than a singular “error” property. This could prevent the intended error/success styling from appearing correctly. The 90% confidence reflects slight uncertainty if “field.error” might be supplied by some external mechanism.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  The onSubmit method awaits the signup service call, dispatches the signupComplete action upon success, and resets the form as expected.

- **Fail** (95%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  While the form-group component includes a span intended to display error messages when a field is touched and “field.error” is truthy, it relies on a property that may not be correctly populated given Angular’s standard is to use “field.errors”. Also, the signup component only displays a general error message on API failure rather than field-specific feedback.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  The component declares a title$ observable that calls this.titleService.getTitle(), but no titleService is injected in the constructor. Instead, a UtilsService is imported in utils.ts for getting the title. This discrepancy indicates that the page title is not being properly set.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  While the component uses @ngrx/store to dispatch an action, there is no usage or reference to @ngrx/effects within the provided code. The evaluation requirement expects evidence of using both for state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The HTML template binds the disabled property of the submit button to the “submitting” flag, ensuring the button is disabled during submission.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  The onSubmit method uses a try-catch-finally block to handle both successful responses (dispatching an action and resetting the form) and error responses (capturing and displaying an error message).

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component follows a modular structure, uses dependency injection, and declares the lifecycle hook ngOnInit. However, the misuse of titleService and the use of toPromise (addressed in Step 12) slightly detract from full adherence to best practices, resulting in a 90% confidence level.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  Although AuthService correctly uses Angular's HttpClient to create Observables, the SignupComponent calls toPromise() on the Observable. Converting an Observable to a Promise (especially with toPromise(), which is deprecated) is not considered best practice in Angular.

- **Fail** (95%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The expected error messages for each form field, as per typical requirements, are not clearly implemented. The custom form-group only checks for “field.error” rather than mapping specific validation errors to explicit messages. This discrepancy results in a failure for matching the specified error message display.
