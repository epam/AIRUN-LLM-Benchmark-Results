# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component includes all three required form fields: name, email, and password  
  The SignupComponent defines a FormGroup with controls for "name", "email", and "password", and these fields are bound to inputs in the HTML.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page includes a heading 'Join PodBaby today.'  
  The HTML template contains an <h2> element with the text "Join PodBaby today.".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a lead paragraph about membership benefits  
  The template includes a <p> element with the class "lead" that describes the benefits of being a member.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form includes a submit button with appropriate styling and icon  
  The form has a submit button with classes "btn btn-primary form-control" and includes an <icon> component with the "sign-in" icon.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a link to the login page with appropriate text  
  The template provides a <router-link> that navigates to "/login/" with clear text prompting existing members to log in.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the FormGroup component or equivalent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display  
  A FormGroupComponent is provided (both ts and html) that renders a label, input, and error message indicator.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Icon component or equivalent is implemented for the signup button  
  The IconComponent is implemented correctly, rendering a span with the icon value.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all validation rules are implemented (name length, email format, password length)  
  The signupForm is set up with Validators: the "name" field checks for required, minimum (3) and maximum (60) lengths, the "email" field requires a valid email format, and the "password" field enforces a minimum length of 6.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure asynchronous validation for both name and email uniqueness is implemented  
  The component defines methods (isNameAvailable and isEmailAvailable) that perform asynchronous HTTP requests to validate uniqueness.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API integration is complete with proper error handling  
  The onSubmit() method calls the signup method in AuthService, dispatches a signupComplete action upon success, and implements try-catch for error handling along with appropriate user feedback.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form layout matches the horizontal form structure specified  
  The form is decorated with the "form-horizontal" class, matching the specified horizontal layout.

- **Fail** (95%): Ensure the page has proper document title setting functionality  
  Although a title$ observable is declared (expected to be sourced from a title service), the component does not inject or properly reference a title-setting service. The import of getTitle from './utils' is unused in favor of an undefined "this.titleService", indicating a likely misconfiguration or missing dependency injection.  
  Explanation: The component attempts to access "this.titleService.getTitle()", but no "titleService" is injected into the constructor. This oversight suggests that the document title functionality is either incomplete or erroneously implemented.
