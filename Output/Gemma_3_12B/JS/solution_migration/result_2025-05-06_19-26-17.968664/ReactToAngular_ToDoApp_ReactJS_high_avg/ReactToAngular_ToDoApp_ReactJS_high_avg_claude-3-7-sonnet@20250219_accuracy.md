# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The answer explicitly mentions setting up the project using Angular CLI with `ng new todo-app` command, which would create an Angular application. The implementation also uses Angular-specific decorators and concepts throughout.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
  
  The answer clearly indicates installing and using @ngrx/store for state management. It includes code snippets showing Store imports, state definitions, and store usage in components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
  
  The answer includes implementing @ngrx/effects for side effects management, specifically handling local storage operations. A TodoEffects class is provided with proper implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
  
  The answer demonstrates proper implementation of NgRx actions (with TodoActionTypes enum and action interfaces), reducers (with createReducer and case handling), and store selectors (used in components with store.select).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
  
  The code snippets show appropriate use of @Component decorators for components and @Input/@Output decorators for component communication.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators
  
  The answer acknowledges the need to replace React's findDOMNode with Angular's @ViewChild for DOM references. However, it doesn't provide a direct code example of @ViewChild implementation, which is why I'm not 100% confident.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
  
  The answer clearly demonstrates using @Input decorators for property binding and @Output EventEmitters for event handling, particularly in the TodoItemComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
  
  The answer mentions converting the Utils class to an Angular service and using dependency injection to access it in components. It also implements TodoEffects as an injectable service.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
  
  The code shows proper dependency injection in constructors, such as injecting the Store in components and services.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
  
  The answer mentions using OnPush change detection strategy for performance optimization, though it doesn't show a specific code example of it being applied to a component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
  
  The answer explicitly mentions replacing the custom Router with Angular's RouterModule and describes how to use it for defining routes and linking them to component selectors.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code snippets demonstrate following Angular style conventions with proper naming, file organization, and component structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
  
  The answer emphasizes leveraging existing TypeScript interfaces and demonstrates proper typing throughout the code, including action interfaces and state interfaces.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
  
  The answer refers to templateUrl properties in the @Component decorators, indicating HTML templates are used instead of JSX.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
  
  The code shows Angular event handlers like (click) being used properly, replacing React's onClick style handlers.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs
  
  The answer explicitly states "I won't provide a complete, runnable Angular application here, but rather a detailed roadmap and illustrative code," indicating that the provided solution is not complete and would require further implementation.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules
  
  The answer does not mention or demonstrate implementing lazy loading for feature modules. This technique is important for optimizing Angular applications, but is completely absent from the solution.
