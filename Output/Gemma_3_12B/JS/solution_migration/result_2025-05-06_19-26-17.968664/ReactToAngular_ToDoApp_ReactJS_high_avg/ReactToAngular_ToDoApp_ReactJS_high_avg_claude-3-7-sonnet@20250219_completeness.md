# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (80%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items

    The answer provides implementation details for displaying todos using observables (`todos$: Observable<ITodo[]>;`) in the TodoAppComponent, but it doesn't include the actual template code that renders the todo items. While the state management structure is defined to store and access todos, without seeing the template implementation I cannot verify that the todo items would actually be rendered correctly.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented

    The answer includes the `handleNewTodoKeyDown` method in the TodoAppComponent that handles the add todo functionality when the Enter key is pressed. The method checks for keyCode 13, retrieves the value from the input field, dispatches an AddTodo action, and clears the input field. The state management structure for this is also included with appropriate actions and reducers.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works

    The answer includes the toggle functionality both at the individual todo level (in the TodoItemComponent with `toggle()` method and `toggleChange` output) and at the app level (with the `toggleAll` method in TodoAppComponent). The corresponding actions and state changes in the reducer are also mentioned.

- **Pass** (85%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented

    The TodoItemComponent includes methods for edit, save, and cancel operations with corresponding outputs that would allow editing functionality. The parent component would capture these events and dispatch appropriate actions, though the template details are not fully described.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented

    The TodoItemComponent includes a `destroy()` method with a corresponding `destroyClick` output event that would emit the todo to be deleted. The action types include a `Destroy` action, and the conceptual approach for handling item deletion is appropriate.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented

    The TodoAppComponent includes a `toggleAll` method that dispatches the appropriate action when the checkbox is toggled. The reducer handles this by updating all todos to the specified completed state.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works

    The TodoFooterComponent includes methods for showing all, active, and completed todos by dispatching SetNowShowing actions. The state includes a `nowShowing` property to track the current filter, and the component receives this state via an observable.

- **Pass** (85%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items

    The TodoFooterComponent receives a `count$` observable as input, which would represent the count of active items. While the template implementation isn't provided, the structure indicates this count would be displayed in the footer.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items

    The TodoFooterComponent includes a `clearCompleted` method that dispatches the ClearCompleted action, and the action types include this action. This would trigger the removal of completed items from the state.

- **Fail** (70%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage

    The answer mentions effects for handling side effects like local storage persistence and includes a partial implementation of TodoEffects with a loadTodos effect, but it only shows code for loading from local storage, not saving to it. A complete implementation would include effects that react to state changes and persist the updated state to storage.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation

    The answer acknowledges the need to replace the custom Router with Angular's RouterModule and mentions defining routes. While specific route path definitions aren't provided, the conceptual approach of linking routes to component selectors is mentioned, suggesting the URL structure could be maintained.

- **Fail** (60%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states

    The answer doesn't specifically address handling empty states in the UI. There's no mention of conditional rendering for when the todo list is empty or when specific filtered views have no items.

- **Pass** (85%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly

    The answer shows proper event handling for the new todo input, including preventing default behavior for the Enter key, trimming input, and only adding non-empty todos. This demonstrates appropriate form submission handling.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships

    The answer clearly defines a component hierarchy with TodoAppComponent as the root, and TodoItem and TodoFooter as child components. It shows appropriate input/output bindings for communication between components, following Angular's component relationship patterns.

- **Pass** (85%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved

    The answer covers the core business logic of the todo application including adding, toggling, editing, deleting todos, filtering, and handling completed items. The implementation approach using NGRX for state management appears to preserve the essential behavior of the application.
