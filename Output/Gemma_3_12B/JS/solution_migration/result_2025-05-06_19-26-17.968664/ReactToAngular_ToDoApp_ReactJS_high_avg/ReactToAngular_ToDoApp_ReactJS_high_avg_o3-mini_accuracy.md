# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The provided answer demonstrates an Angular migration and usage of Angular CLI, components, and modules, but it does not explicitly state that it uses Angular 14.x. This step is not clearly satisfied.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The answer clearly shows the import and usage of @ngrx/store for managing the state in various components and reducers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  The answer includes a detailed example of a TodoEffects class that uses @ngrx/effects to handle side effects such as local storage persistence.

- **Pass** (80%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  Actions and reducers are illustrated. While selectors are not explicitly defined in dedicated functions, the use of store.select('todos') and store.select('nowShowing') indicates basic selector usage. Thus, this step is largely met, though explicit selectors could be clearer.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  All component examples clearly use Angular decorators like @Component for declaring components, as well as @Input and @Output for property binding and event communication.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  The provided migration plan still uses direct DOM access (e.g., document.querySelector) in the TodoApp component rather than using Angular’s @ViewChild for accessing DOM elements.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  The TodoItem and TodoFooter component examples demonstrate the correct use of @Input and @Output with Angular’s EventEmitter.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  The answer discusses converting the React Utils class into an Angular service and shows usage of dependency injection (e.g., in TodoEffects). However, a full implementation of the service isn’t shown. The concept is clear but the example is not fully detailed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  Dependency injection is well demonstrated in the TodoAppComponent (injecting Store) and in TodoEffects (injecting Actions and Store).

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  Although the answer mentions using Angular’s change detection strategies (OnPush) in the key considerations section, none of the component implementations explicitly set a change detection strategy.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  The answer includes a dedicated section on Routing, mentioning the use of Angular’s RouterModule to define routes. However, no detailed routing module or example code is provided.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  While many Angular conventions are followed (e.g., use of decorators, separation of concerns), there are deviations such as direct DOM manipulations with document.querySelector instead of Angular’s recommended approaches. This detracts from full compliance with the Angular style guide.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  The answer includes several TypeScript interfaces (e.g., for State and ITodo) and consistently relies on TypeScript’s static typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  The migration clearly replaces JSX constructs with Angular’s templateUrl and corresponding HTML templates.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  The provided Angular component methods are intended to handle events via Angular’s event binding system. Although there is a reliance on some direct DOM queries, overall React event handler patterns are replaced with Angular’s way of handling events.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  No extraneous TODO comments are present in the provided migration outline and code snippets.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  The answer does not include any implementation or reference to lazy loading for feature modules; it only briefly mentions routing without addressing lazy loading.
