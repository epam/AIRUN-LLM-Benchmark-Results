# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The answer outlines a TodoApp component that selects todos from the store and introduces a separate TodoItem component, implying that a list of todo items would be rendered. However, it does not include the actual template or explicit list rendering, which makes the implementation implicit.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoAppComponent includes the method handleNewTodoKeyDown that dispatches the AddTodo action when the Enter key is pressed and a non-empty value is found. This clearly implements the add-new-todo functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  Both the TodoAppComponent’s toggleAll method and the TodoItemComponent’s toggle method are provided, and the reducer handles the ToggleAll action. This confirms that toggling functionality is implemented.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItem component provides methods (edit, save, cancel) and emits corresponding events to handle editing. Although the full editing flow isn’t detailed in the roadmap, the provided methods indicate that editing functionality is intended.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  There is a destroy method in the TodoItemComponent that emits an event for deletion, and the action type for Destroy is defined in the roadmap. While the reducer case for deletion is not fully detailed, the overall plan is in place.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  The TodoAppComponent includes a toggleAll method that dispatches a ToggleAll action with a payload indicating whether all items should be completed. This implements the “mark all as complete” functionality.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  The state includes a nowShowing property, and the TodoFooterComponent provides methods (showAll, showActive, showCompleted) that dispatch actions to update the filtering state. Although the filtering logic in the view isn’t fully shown, the roadmap addresses it.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooterComponent has an input property count$ (an Observable<number>) and additional observables for completedCount and nowShowing, indicating that the component is designed to display item counts.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The TodoFooterComponent includes a clearCompleted method that dispatches a ClearCompleted action. Although the reducer’s full implementation isn’t shown, the action type is defined and the intent is clear.

- **Fail** (80%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  The provided Effects example includes a loadTodos effect that reads from local storage using a Utils service. However, there is no clear implementation for persisting (saving) updated todos back to local storage. This partial coverage suggests that persistence is not fully implemented.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The roadmap mentions setting up Angular’s RouterModule and initializing routing in the TodoAppComponent as well as elements like route guards. Although detailed URL mappings are not provided, the intended use of Angular Router implies that maintaining a URL structure is considered.

- **Fail** (80%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  The answer does not include any explicit handling or UI components for empty states (e.g., when there are no todo items). This area is not addressed in the provided roadmap or code snippets.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  The handler for new todo input (handleNewTodoKeyDown) intercepts the Enter key, prevents the default, and properly processes the form submission. This demonstrates that form submissions are handled.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The answer clearly separates concerns by transforming React components into Angular components (TodoApp, TodoItem, TodoFooter) and organizes state management via NGRX. This indicates that component relationships are well maintained.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  The roadmap covers key functionalities like adding, editing, toggling, deleting, filtering, and clearing todos. While some details (e.g., persistence) are less complete, the primary business logic is preserved in the migration plan.
