# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The answer clearly indicates the use of Angular 14 framework from the beginning with instructions to create a new Angular 14 project: "create a new Angular 14 project using the Angular CLI".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS
  
  The answer uses ES modules throughout the code examples with import statements, and specifically mentions the migration from RequireJS to ES Modules: "RequireJS to ES Modules: This is a fundamental shift. You'll need to remove the RequireJS configuration and use Angular's module system."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management
  
  The answer shows implementation of @ngrx/store through code examples and installation instructions: "npm install @ngrx/store @ngrx/effects @ngrx/data" and includes proper store configuration in the app.module.ts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects
  
  The answer demonstrates implementation of @ngrx/effects with examples in todo.effects.ts and proper configuration in app.module.ts.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management
  
  The answer includes defined actions (addTodo, toggleTodo, removeTodo, setTodos), a reducer function, effects for localStorage persistence, and mentions selectors (getTodos).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator
  
  The answer shows a proper implementation of an injectable service with the @Injectable decorator in the TodoStorageService example.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service
  
  The answer demonstrates localStorage implementation in both the effects (for NgRx integration) and directly in the TodoStorageService with get() and put() methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators
  
  The answer shows proper use of @Component decorators in component implementation examples, specifically in the TodoListComponent.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators
  
  The answer mentions the need to implement custom directives but doesn't explicitly show a @Directive implementation example, though it acknowledges "The custom directives `todoFocus` and `todoEscape` can be implemented as Angular directives."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)
  
  The answer shows proper Angular template syntax in examples, including *ngFor in the TodoListComponent template and mentions the conversion from ng-repeat to *ngFor.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))
  
  The answer shows proper event binding syntax in examples, such as (click)="removeTodo(todo.id)" and mentions the conversion from ng-click to (click).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])
  
  The answer shows proper property binding syntax with examples like [class.completed]="todo.completed" in the template.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed
  
  The answer shows the implementation of the OnInit lifecycle hook in the TodoListComponent example.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models
  
  The answer mentions using TypeScript features including interfaces, and references a Todo model in the import statements, though it doesn't show the complete implementation of the model.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services
  
  The answer shows proper dependency injection in the TodoListComponent constructor and mentions it as part of Angular's features.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The answer follows Angular style guide conventions in naming (e.g., kebab-case for files, PascalCase for classes) and structure, and explicitly mentions "Follow the Angular style guide" as a recommendation.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings
  
  While the answer doesn't explicitly address console errors, it mentions testing thoroughly and follows best practices that would prevent common errors. The code examples appear syntactically correct.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)
  
  The answer demonstrates appropriate use of TypeScript features in the examples, including type annotations and interfaces, and explicitly recommends "Use TypeScript features like interfaces, type annotations, and generics."

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code
  
  The provided code examples are clean without TODOs or commented-out code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design
  
  The answer clearly separates concerns with dedicated components for specific functions (TodoListComponent, TodoItemComponent, TodoFormComponent, etc.), demonstrating adherence to the single responsibility principle.
