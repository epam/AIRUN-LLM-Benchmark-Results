# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list
  
  The code clearly defines a `TodoListComponent` that renders a list of todos using Angular's `*ngFor` directive.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos
  
  The code defines a `TodoFormComponent` component which is explicitly listed in the component structure and included in the `AppModule` declarations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos
  
  The `TodoListComponent` has functionality for editing todos, as demonstrated by the `editTodo` method and the editing class condition in the template.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos
  
  The code includes a `TodoFilterComponent` that is explicitly mentioned in the component structure and included in the `AppModule` declarations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics
  
  The `FooterComponent` is explicitly defined to display the remaining count and other statistics.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos
  
  The code includes an `addTodo` action and corresponding reducer logic that adds a new todo to the state.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos
  
  The code shows an `editTodo` method in the `TodoListComponent`, but the complete implementation of saving edits is not fully shown. The UI toggle for editing mode is present, but the complete edit flow isn't explicitly demonstrated.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos
  
  The code includes a `removeTodo` action and reducer logic, as well as a delete button in the `TodoListComponent` template that dispatches this action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed
  
  The code includes a `toggleTodo` action and reducer logic to toggle a todo's completed status, as well as a checkbox in the `TodoListComponent` template.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)
  
  While a `TodoFilterComponent` is mentioned, the detailed implementation of the filtering logic is not shown. However, the overall structure indicates this functionality is part of the design.

- **Fail** (70%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete
  
  The provided code snippets don't explicitly demonstrate an action or UI element for marking all todos as complete or incomplete. This appears to be missing from the implementation details provided.

- **Fail** (70%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos
  
  While the `FooterComponent` mentions having a "clear completed button", there is no specific action or reducer logic shown for clearing completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos
  
  The `FooterComponent` is explicitly described as displaying the remaining count.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage
  
  The code includes both a `TodoStorageService` that handles localStorage operations and `TodoEffects` for data persistence specifically mentioning localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization
  
  The `TodoEffects` class includes a `loadTodos` effect that loads data from localStorage.

- **Fail** (70%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing
  
  The code mentions that a `todoEscape` directive would be needed, but doesn't provide its implementation. It's acknowledged as a migration need but not shown in the code snippets.

- **Fail** (70%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo
  
  Similar to the escape key handling, the `todoFocus` directive is mentioned as a migration need but its implementation is not provided. The answer suggests using Angular's built-in focus management or a third-party library.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original
  
  The code snippets include class names that match those typically used in TodoMVC applications, suggesting visual consistency. However, without seeing the complete CSS implementation, this can't be verified with 100% confidence.

- **Fail** (80%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately
  
  The provided code snippets do not show any validation logic for handling empty todo titles. This validation would typically be included in the form submission logic.

- **Fail** (80%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter
  
  The answer acknowledges that Angular's router is different from AngularJS's `$location` service and notes that the router would need to be used for navigation, but doesn't show the implementation for updating the URL based on filter selection.
