# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
   The answer explicitly instructs the user to create an Angular 14 project using the Angular CLI (e.g. "ng new todo-app") and refers to Angular 14 throughout.

2. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
   The answer shows code written with standard ES module syntax and explains that the migration moves away from RequireJS toward the Angular module system.

3. **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
   The answer includes the import and configuration of StoreModule.forRoot with a todo reducer and shows actions and reducers for todo management.

4. **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
   The answer includes a proper implementation of EffectsModule.forRoot and defines a TodoEffects class with effects that utilize localStorage actions.

5. **Fail** (90%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
   Although actions, reducers, and effects are clearly defined, the selectors are only referenced (e.g. "getTodos" is imported in TodoListComponent) with no implementation provided. Because a complete example of selectors is missing, this step is not fully satisfied.  
   (Confidence is 90% because in practice, a selector would exist in a real project, but its absence in the provided code snippet is a gap.)

6. **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
   The TodoStorageService and TodoEffects classes use the @Injectable decorator appropriately.

7. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
   The TodoStorageService demonstrates the use of localStorage for getting and putting data, and the effects also reference localStorage actions.

8. **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
   Several components (e.g., TodoListComponent) are defined with the proper @Component decorator and include inline templates or template syntax.

9. **Fail** (80%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
   The answer mentions that custom directives (such as todoFocus and todoEscape) can be implemented as Angular directives but does not provide any code snippet or direct evidence showing the use of the @Directive decorator. While the commentary is useful, the absence of an example implementation means this step isnâ€™t fully demonstrated.  
   (Confidence is 80% because the explanation suggests awareness of the need, yet there is no concrete use case provided.)

10. **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
    The TodoListComponent template uses *ngFor and includes directives like [class.completed] and *ngIf are described in the instructions for HTML template conversion.

11. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
    The code examples use (click) events (for example, in the TodoListComponent for toggle and remove actions).

12. **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
    The template in TodoListComponent uses property binding with [class.completed] and other similar Angular binding forms.

13. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
    The TodoListComponent implements the OnInit lifecycle hook. Given the simplicity of the provided code, the usage is appropriate.

14. **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
    An interface for State is defined in the todo reducer file, and references to a Todo model (from ../models/todo.model) indicate that data models are intended to be defined.

15. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
    Constructors in components like TodoListComponent and in services are used to inject dependencies correctly.

16. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
    The code is modular, uses clear naming conventions, separates concerns (components, actions, reducers, etc.), and adheres to general Angular style practices.

17. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
    There is no evidence in the answer of code that would generate console errors or warnings. (Note: This evaluation is based on the provided sample code and textual explanation rather than a runtime test.)

18. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
    TypeScript features such as type annotations, interfaces, and ES module syntax are used throughout the code samples.

19. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
    The answer does not include any extraneous commented-out code or TODO markers within the provided snippets.

20. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design  
    The design is modular, with each Angular component handling a specific responsibility (e.g., TodoListComponent, TodoItemComponent, TodoFormComponent, etc.), in line with the single responsibility principle.
