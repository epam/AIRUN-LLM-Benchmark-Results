# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list  
   → The provided answer includes a clearly defined TodoListComponent with appropriate template code.

2. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos  
   → A TodoFormComponent is listed in the project outline, indicating that adding todos is addressed.

3. **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos  
   → Although the TodoListComponent contains an editTodo method and manages an editedTodo variable, there is no dedicated component solely responsible for editing todos. This does not fully satisfy the step’s requirement.

4. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos  
   → A TodoFilterComponent is explicitly mentioned, demonstrating the presence of a dedicated filtering component.

5. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics  
   → The FooterComponent is described as displaying the remaining count and a “clear completed” button, which satisfies the requirement.

6. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos  
   → The solution includes an addTodo action, and TodoFormComponent is mentioned for handling new todos, indicating this functionality is intended to be implemented.

7. **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos  
   → While there is a method (editTodo) that sets an edit state in the TodoListComponent, there is no complete editing workflow (for example, saving changes) or a dedicated editing component. The editing functionality is only partially addressed.

8. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos  
   → A removeTodo action is defined and is dispatched via a button in the TodoListComponent, demonstrating deletion capability.

9. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed  
   → The toggleTodo action is defined and used to switch a todo’s completed state, satisfying this requirement.

10. **Fail** (95%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)  
    → Although a TodoFilterComponent is mentioned, the code snippet and provided details do not clearly illustrate the implementation logic (for example, the use of pipes or conditional rendering) required for filtering by status. Confidence is slightly reduced because the infrastructure is hinted at but not fully demonstrated.

11. **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete  
    → There is no implementation or mention of a “mark all” functionality in the provided code or roadmap.

12. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos  
    → While the FooterComponent is noted to display a “clear completed” button, there is no accompanying code or state management shown that actually implements the clearing of completed todos.

13. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos  
    → The FooterComponent is described as responsible for displaying the remaining count of todos, meeting this step’s criteria.

14. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage  
    → Persistence is addressed through the TodoStorageService and the usage of localStorageActions in TodoEffects, demonstrating localStorage persistence.

15. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization  
    → The TodoEffects include a loadTodos effect that uses localStorageActions.load, which satisfies the loading requirement.

16. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing  
    → There is no code or directive provided that captures the escape key to cancel editing, meaning this functionality is missing.

17. **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo  
    → Although the discussion mentions directives (like a possible todoFocus) to manage focus, no concrete implementation or code snippet is provided for automatically focusing the input field during editing.

18. **Fail** (90%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original  
    → The roadmap focuses on migration details and core functionality, but no verification (e.g., UI styling or screenshots) is provided to ensure that the visual appearance aligns with the original. Confidence is slightly less because visual similarity might be addressed through styling that isn’t shown.

19. **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately  
    → There is no explicit handling or validation shown in the code for empty todo titles, leaving this functionality unverified.

20. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter  
    → Although route management is mentioned in the key considerations, there is no implementation shown that updates the URL to reflect the selected filter.
