# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed

    The solution demonstrates this functionality in the `handleNewTodoKeyDown` method in the `App.tsx` component which checks for the ENTER_KEY and dispatches the addTodo action when pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter

    The solution includes filtering logic in the `App.tsx` component where it filters todos based on the `nowShowing` state (ALL_TODOS, ACTIVE_TODOS, or COMPLETED_TODOS) and renders them in a list.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos

    The solution includes a toggle-all input in the `App.tsx` component with an onChange handler that calls `handleToggleAll` which dispatches the `toggleAll` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted

    The solution shows that todo items can be:
    - Toggled via the `onToggle` handler
    - Edited via the `onEdit` handler
    - Deleted via the `onDestroy` handler
    All implemented in the `TodoItem.tsx` component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode

    The solution includes a label with an `onDoubleClick` handler that calls `handleEdit` which dispatches the `setEditing` action in the `TodoItem` component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo

    The `handleKeyDown` function in `TodoItem.tsx` checks for the ENTER_KEY and calls `handleSubmit` which dispatches the save action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value

    The `handleKeyDown` function in `TodoItem.tsx` checks for the ESCAPE_KEY and resets the editText to the original todo title and exits editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items

    The `TodoFooter` component is rendered with the `count` prop set to `activeTodoCount` which represents the number of active items.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)

    The solution includes filter functionality through the `nowShowing` state and the `TodoFooter` component which allows switching between All, Active, and Completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos

    The solution includes a "Clear completed" button in the `TodoFooter` component that calls `handleClearCompleted` which dispatches the `clearCompleted` action.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence

    The solution includes a `Utils.ts` file with methods for storing and retrieving data from localStorage. However, I don't see explicit code that uses this for persisting todos between sessions, though the utility function is provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state

    The solution conditionally renders UI elements based on the todo state, such as showing/hiding the footer based on whether there are active or completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count

    The solution includes a `Utils.pluralize` function that correctly pluralizes words based on count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components

    The solution demonstrates proper component composition with separate components for `App`, `TodoItem`, `TodoFooter`, and `Header`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality

    The solution organizes files by functionality with separate files for components, Redux logic (todoSlice.ts, store.ts), and utilities.
