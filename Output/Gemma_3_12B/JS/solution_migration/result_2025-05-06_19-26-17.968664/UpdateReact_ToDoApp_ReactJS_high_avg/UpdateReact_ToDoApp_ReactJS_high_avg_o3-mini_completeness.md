# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The App component’s handleNewTodoKeyDown function checks for the ENTER_KEY and dispatches addTodo if the input is non-empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The code filters todos based on the nowShowing filter before rendering, which meets this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  A toggle-all checkbox is provided that calls handleToggleAll, dispatching the toggleAll action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  The TodoItem component receives callbacks (onToggle, onDestroy, onEdit, onSave, onCancel) that provide these functionalities.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  The label in TodoItem has an onDoubleClick handler that triggers editing via the setEditing action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  In TodoItem, when the Enter key is detected, the handleKeyDown function calls handleSubmit which dispatches save and exits editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  The TodoItem’s keyDown handler checks for ESCAPE_KEY, resets the editText to the original todo title, and exits editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  The App component calculates activeTodoCount and passes it to the TodoFooter, ensuring the active item count is shown.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The nowShowing state is passed to the TodoFooter, implying that different filters (All, Active, Completed) are supported.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  The TodoFooter is provided with an onClearCompleted callback that handles clearing completed todos.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  Although a Utils.ts file with a store function is present, none of the provided code snippets integrate localStorage persistence within the Redux state management, so persistence is missing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  The code conditionally renders elements such as the TodoFooter (based on counts) and checks the state of todos (e.g., marking all as complete) appropriately.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  A pluralize utility function is defined in Utils.ts. Although its usage isn’t explicitly shown in the provided snippets, it is assumed to be utilized in components like TodoFooter. (Confidence is 90% because the actual usage in the UI isn’t illustrated.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The code is broken into distinct components (Header, TodoItem, TodoFooter) and uses separate files for Redux logic and utilities, demonstrating good component composition.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The structure separates concerns (e.g., Redux slices, store configuration, components, and utility functions), indicating that files are well organized.
