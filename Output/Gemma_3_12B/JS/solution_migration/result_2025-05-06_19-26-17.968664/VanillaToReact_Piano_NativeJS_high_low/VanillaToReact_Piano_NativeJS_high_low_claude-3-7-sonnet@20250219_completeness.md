# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'
  
  The code includes a Header component (Header.tsx) that clearly renders an h1 element with the class "header-title" and text "Virtual Piano".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons
  
  The Main.tsx component includes a div with class "btn-container" containing two buttons: one with class "btn-notes" for "Notes" and another with class "btn-letters" for "Letters".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)
  
  The Piano.tsx component renders piano keys with appropriate classes. Both regular piano keys and sharp keys (with the "sharp" class) are included in the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes
  
  The piano keys in Piano.tsx have data attributes for both letters and notes. For example: `data-letter="D"` and `data-note="c"` for the first piano key.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked
  
  The Piano component includes a playNote function that loads and plays audio files when keys are clicked. This function properly maps note names to audio files.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)
  
  The code implements tracking of played notes using a useRef hook, which suggests proper handling of active keys. However, the CSS implementation for highlighting is not explicitly shown in the provided code, though the logic for tracking active notes exists.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes
  
  The piano keys have onKeyDown and onKeyUp event handlers that call playNote and stopNote functions respectively, allowing keyboard input to trigger piano notes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked
  
  The Main component includes state management for isNotes and a handleButtonClick function that toggles this state based on which button is clicked. The active button is highlighted with the "btn-active" class.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes
  
  The handleFullscreen function in Main.tsx correctly toggles fullscreen mode using document.documentElement.requestFullscreen() and document.exitFullscreen().

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly
  
  While the code tracks played notes in an array, it doesn't appear to have specific logic to handle the unique challenges of multiple simultaneous key presses (like chord playing). The implementation focuses on single key events.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys
  
  The provided code does not implement mouse drag functionality. There are only onClick handlers for piano keys, but no onMouseOver, onMouseDown, or other event handlers needed to support dragging across keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information
  
  The Footer component (Footer.tsx) renders a footer element with a div containing the year "2020".
