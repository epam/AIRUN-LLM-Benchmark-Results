# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title "Virtual Piano".  
  The Header component clearly renders an h1 element with the text "Virtual Piano".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with "Notes" and "Letters" toggle buttons.  
  The Main.tsx component contains a div with the class "btn-container" and two buttons labeled "Notes" and "Letters" with toggle classes.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys).  
  The Piano.tsx code shows rendering for at least one natural key and one sharp key, with a comment indicating the presence of “other keys …”. Although not all keys are explicitly listed in the snippet, the inclusion of an audio map and the comment suggests that the full implementation is expected. (Confidence reduced to 90% due to the excerpted nature of the code.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes.  
  The keys in Piano.tsx correctly include attributes like data-letter and data-note for both natural and sharp keys.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked.  
  The playNote function correctly resets the audio’s currentTime and plays the sound corresponding to each key. (Confidence is 95% because while the audio loading mechanism is present, error handling is minimal.)

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed).  
  The provided code does not implement any visual feedback (such as adding an active CSS class) when a piano key is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes.  
  The code includes onKeyDown and onKeyUp event handlers for the keys, which detect and play the audio based on keyboard input.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked.  
  Although Main.tsx sets a boolean state (isNotes) based on which button is active, there is no evidence in the code that this state drives a change in what is rendered on the piano keys (e.g., displaying notes vs. letters).

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes.  
  Although a handleFullscreen function is provided as a snippet, there is no indication that it is integrated into a functional fullscreen toggle button within the application.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly.  
  The code uses a ref (played) to track currently playing notes; however, the mechanism only prevents replaying an already playing note and does not demonstrate robust handling for playing multiple keys at once. (Confidence is slightly reduced because the approach might work in some scenarios but isn’t explicitly designed for true simultaneous presses.)

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys.  
  The provided implementation only includes onClick, onKeyDown, and onKeyUp handlers. There is no implementation for handling mouse drag events across multiple piano keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information.  
  The Footer component clearly renders a footer with a container displaying the year "2020".
