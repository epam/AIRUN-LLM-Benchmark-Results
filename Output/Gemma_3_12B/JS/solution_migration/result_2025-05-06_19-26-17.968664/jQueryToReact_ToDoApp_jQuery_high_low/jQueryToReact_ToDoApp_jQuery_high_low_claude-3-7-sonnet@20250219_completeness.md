# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos
  
  The code includes a `TodoHeader` component that contains an `<h1>todos</h1>` title and an input field with the class "new-todo" and placeholder "What needs to be done?".

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos
  
  The code includes a `TodoList` component with a main section and a list of todos. However, I don't see a clear implementation of the toggle-all checkbox in the provided code snippets, which is why my confidence is not 100%.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button
  
  The `TodoItem` component clearly includes a toggle checkbox (`<input type="checkbox" className="toggle">`), a label for displaying the title (`<label>{todo.title}</label>`), and a delete button (`<button className="destroy">`).

- **Fail** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode
  
  The provided code does not implement functionality for entering edit mode when double-clicking a todo label. There's no event handler for `onDoubleClick` on the label element, and no code to handle the editing state of a todo item.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The code includes filter functionality with options for 'all', 'active', and 'completed' in the `TodoFooter` component, and the filtering logic is implemented in the `TodoList` component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization
  
  The `TodoFooter` component displays the count of active todos: `<span className="todo-count"><strong>{activeTodoCount}</strong> items left</span>`. 

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter
  
  The `TodoFooter` includes filter links with conditional CSS classes based on the current filter: `className={filter === 'all' ? 'selected' : ''}`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist
  
  The code conditionally renders the 'Clear completed' button only when there are completed todos: `{todos.some(todo => todo.completed) && (<button className="clear-completed">`).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter
  
  The `TodoHeader` component includes an `onKeyDown` event handler that dispatches the `addTodo` action when the Enter key is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos
  
  The `TodoItem` component includes a checkbox with an `onChange` event that dispatches the `toggleTodo` action.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once
  
  The provided code does not implement functionality for toggling all todos at once. There's no implementation of the toggle-all checkbox or its associated behavior.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management
  
  The code does not implement todo editing functionality. There's no UI or event handlers for editing mode, and no focus management logic for the edit input field.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos
  
  The `TodoItem` component includes a delete button that dispatches the `destroyTodo` action when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos
  
  The `TodoFooter` component includes a 'Clear completed' button that dispatches the `clearCompleted` action when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status
  
  The `TodoList` component includes filtering logic that filters todos based on the current filter value from the Redux store.
