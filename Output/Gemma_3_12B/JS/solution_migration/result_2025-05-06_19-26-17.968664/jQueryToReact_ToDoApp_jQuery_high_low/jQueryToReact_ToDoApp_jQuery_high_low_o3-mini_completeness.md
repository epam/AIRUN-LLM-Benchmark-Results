# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos  
  The TodoHeader component clearly renders a header with a "todos" title and an input field for new items.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos  
  While the TodoList component renders a list of todos, there is no toggle-all checkbox provided in the main section.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button  
  The TodoItem component renders a checkbox (to toggle completion), a label for the todo title, and a button to delete the todo.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode  
  There is no implementation for entering an editing mode on a double-click (or any event) on a todo label.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  Filtering is implemented via filter links in the TodoFooter component and the filtering logic in the TodoList component.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization  
  The footer displays the count as “items left” without adjusting for singular (“item left”) when only one todo remains.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter  
  The TodoFooter component includes filter links that apply the "selected" class based on the current filter state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist  
  The TodoFooter component conditionally renders a "Clear completed" button if any todo is marked as completed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter  
  The input field in TodoHeader (and a similar handler in App.tsx) listens for the Enter key to dispatch an action to add a new todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos  
  The TodoItem component correctly toggles a todo’s completion status when the checkbox is changed.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once  
  There is no implementation for a toggle-all functionality that would change the state of all todos simultaneously.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management  
  The provided code does not include an editing mode for todos, nor is there any focus management for such a feature.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos  
  Each todo item includes a delete button (destroy button) that dispatches the action to remove the individual todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos  
  The TodoFooter component includes a button that dispatches an action to clear all completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status  
  The filtering logic in the TodoList component correctly filters todos based on the current filter state (all, active, completed).
