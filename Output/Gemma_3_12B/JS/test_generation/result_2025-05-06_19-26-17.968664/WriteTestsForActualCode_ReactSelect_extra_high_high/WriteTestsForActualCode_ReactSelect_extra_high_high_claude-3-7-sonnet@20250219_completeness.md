# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist
  
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present
  
- **Pass** (90%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)
  
  The test suite includes tests for clicking the dropdown and selecting options, but doesn't explicitly test hovering behavior, which could be relevant for certain UI feedback mechanisms in the Select component.

- **Fail** (80%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior
  
  The provided test suite doesn't explicitly test the distinction between controlled and uncontrolled behavior. There are no tests that verify the component works correctly when value is controlled externally versus when it manages its own state internally.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values
  
  While the test suite includes a test for selecting an option, it lacks specific tests for removing values or clearing the selection entirely, which are important operations for this component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented
  
- **Fail** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality
  
  Although the test suite mocks the createFilter function, it doesn't actually test the filtering behavior when a user types to search for options.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist
  
  The provided test suite doesn't include any tests for multi-select functionality, which is a core feature of many Select components.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility
  
  The test suite checks for the presence of combobox role but doesn't verify other important ARIA attributes that would be necessary for screen reader compatibility.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested
  
  There are no tests for how the component behaves when provided with an empty options array.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states
  
  The test suite doesn't include tests for loading states or error handling.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states
  
  There are no tests for disabled options or a disabled Select component.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance
  
  The test suite doesn't include any performance tests with large option sets.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested
  
  Although keyboard navigation tests exist, the test suite doesn't thoroughly verify focus management behaviors during various interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering
  
- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations
  
  There are no tests for custom formatOptionLabel implementations.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)
  
  The test suite doesn't verify that callback functions like onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, and onMenuClose are properly called.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)
  
  There are no tests specifically for indicator components such as dropdown indicators, clear buttons, or loading indicators.
