# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist  
  The test "renders without errors" confirms that the component renders with default props.

- **Fail** (95%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present  
  The tests simulate arrow down and arrow up navigation, but there are no tests for tab, enter, or escape keys. Confidence is 95% because while arrow key navigation is partially covered, the requirement is for full keyboard functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)  
  Although there are tests for clicking (e.g., opening the menu and selecting an option), there is no test covering hovering behavior.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior  
  There is no explicit differentiation or tests covering controlled versus uncontrolled states.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values  
  The tests cover selecting an option and typing in the input, but there are no tests for removing or clearing values.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented  
  The test suite checks that the menu opens upon a click; however, no tests verify the closing behavior of the menu.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality  
  While an input change is simulated, there are no assertions or tests verifying that the options are filtered or searched correctly.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist  
  The test suite does not include any tests specific to multi-select scenarios.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility  
  Although roles like "combobox" and "listbox" are used, there is no explicit testing of ARIA attributes or screen reader compatibility (e.g., aria-labels, aria-expanded).

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested  
  There are no tests that verify the componentâ€™s behavior when provided with empty options.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states  
  The test suite does not incorporate scenarios for loading or error states.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states  
  There are no tests dedicated to handling disabled options or disabled states.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance  
  No tests simulate or evaluate the component's performance with a large number of options.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested  
  Focus management is not explicitly addressed, aside from basic keyboard simulation; dedicated focus tests are missing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering  
  There is a test that checks for the placeholder text and verifies input value updates.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations  
  There are no tests that validate behavior when using a custom formatOptionLabel function.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)  
  Callback functions are mentioned in the design guidance, but none are explicitly tested in the suite.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)  
  The test suite does not include tests for indicator components such as dropdown icons, clear buttons, or loading indicators.
