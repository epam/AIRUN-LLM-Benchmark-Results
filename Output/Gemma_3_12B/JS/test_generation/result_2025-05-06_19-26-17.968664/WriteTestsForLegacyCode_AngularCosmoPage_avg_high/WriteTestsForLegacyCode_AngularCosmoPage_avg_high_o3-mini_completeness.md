# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources  
  The provided tests for the REST factory cover all defined resources (blocks, blocksRequirements, comments, content, contentExtras, contentRevisions, contentRevisionsExtras, contentTags, files, filesTags, menus, modules, sitemaps, themes, settings, users) and an operation (update) as well.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly  
  There are no tests provided for the Page factory to check its properties or its initialization behavior.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly  
  The provided answer does not include any tests for the Users factory, so there is no evidence that its properties are being validated.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods  
  While the tests for pageCtrl cover several functions (e.g., initialization, savePage, titleChange, deletePage), they do not cover all public methods. For instance, tests for functions like saveLocal or autocompleteTags (if they are public methods) are missing and there is little indication that all conditional branches are accounted for.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller  
  There is a test ("should initialize page variables") that verifies the initialization of page properties in the controller.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation  
  The test "should handle URL auto-generation" confirms that when the title is changed, the URL is auto-generated accordingly.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction  
  The answer does not include any tests for a function named saveLocal or similar behavior involving localStorage interactions.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality  
  There are no tests provided for the autocompleteTags function or any functionality related to tag suggestions.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)  
  Although there are tests calling savePage and verifying REST.content.save is called, the tests do not explore all conditional branches such as creating a new page versus updating or handling duplicate pages.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types  
  The tests do not include any cases to cover edge conditions such as when URLs are empty or when different page types are involved.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly  
  There is a test ("should handle deletePage function") that checks that REST.content.delete is called appropriately when deleting a page.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions  
  The provided tests do not address the handling of page versions nor interactions with localStorage related to versioning.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components  
  There is no mention or evidence of code coverage analysis that would indicate at least 80% coverage across all components.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling  
  The tests do not check for any event broadcasting or handling functionality within the application.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality  
  There are no tests included that address any date handling or scheduling features.
