# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering  
  The provided app.test.tsx includes a test ("should render the header with the title and input field") which confirms that component rendering is verified.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos  
  The sample includes a test ("should add a todo when Enter is pressed in the input field") which checks the addTodo functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos  
  There is no test case in app.test.tsx explicitly verifying the toggling all todos functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos  
  The tests for filtering todos (for example, checking different views based on filters) are not provided in the sample.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  No tests are provided for the clearing of completed todos within the app.test.tsx sample.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering  
  The todoItem.test.tsx contains a test ("should render the todo title") that validates rendering of the TodoItem component.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos  
  While tests for toggling (via clicking checkbox) and destroying (via the destroy button) are present, there is no explicit test verifying the editing functionality (i.e. that the onEdit callback is triggered or behaves correctly).  
  Explanation: The editing case is only passed as a prop without an associated test.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events  
  There are no sample test cases dealing with keyboard events (e.g., triggering events on pressing Enter/Escape during editing) in the provided todoItem.test.tsx.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts  
  Although the footer test file is mentioned in the breakdown, no actual sample code is provided that tests rendering with various todo counts.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation  
  There is no sample code demonstrating tests for the filter navigation functionality in the footer component.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The provided answer does not show any tests for the "clear completed" functionality within the footer test file.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos  
  The todoModel.test.tsx includes tests for adding, saving, and destroying todos, as well as toggleAll and clearCompleted. However, there is no explicit test for toggling a single todo item.  
  Explanation: The absence of a dedicated test for the individual toggle method (as opposed to 'toggleAll') causes this step to be marked as failing.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions  
  While the inform function is implicitly invoked in the localStorage test, there are no explicit tests for the subscribe functionality or verifying that subscribers are correctly notified.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The provided test ("should clear completed todos") exists and validates the clearCompleted functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation  
  The answer mentions utility functions in overview but does not provide any sample tests for uuid generation.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality  
  There are no provided test cases for the pluralize function in the utils.ts file.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations  
  Despite mentioning localStorage operations in the explanation, no sample tests covering store functionality in utils.ts are present.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function  
  No tests are included to check the extend function in the utils.ts file.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx  
  All sample test files (e.g., todoModel.test.tsx, todoItem.test.tsx, app.test.tsx) follow the specified naming convention.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data  
  The todoItem tests create a mock todo (e.g., mockTodo with id, title, and completed state) which qualifies as a test fixture for sample todo data.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented  
  A mock for the Router is declared in the app.test.tsx sample; however, there are no tests verifying routing functionality or interaction, and the Router mock is not actively used in test cases.
