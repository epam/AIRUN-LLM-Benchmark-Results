### Answer:
Okay, here's a detailed documentation for the provided React component, incorporating the requested steps and focusing on a professional, technical style.  I've aimed for clarity, completeness, and a level of detail suitable for a developer reviewing the code.

**1. Component Overview**

*   **Component Name:** `Signup`
*   **Purpose:** This component handles the user registration process, validating user input and submitting the form. It leverages React Router for navigation and Redux for state management.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Handles form submission and validation.
    *   Provides a signup experience with a form for name, email, and password.
    *   Uses a `FormGroup` to collect form data.
    *   Implements a `handleSubmit` function to handle form submission and dispatch actions.
    *   Includes a "Already a member?" section for returning to the login page.

**2. Technical Documentation**

*   **Overview:** The `Signup` component is a reusable component designed to streamline the user registration process within a React application. It encapsulates the form submission logic, validation, and submission handling, promoting code reusability and maintainability.  It utilizes Redux for state management and React Router for navigation.

*   **Props:**

    *   `fields`: An object containing the required fields for the signup form.  This object defines the names and types of the fields (e.g., `name`, `email`, `password`).  The `children` prop allows for the display of any content within the input fields.
    *   `handleSubmit`: A function that handles form submission. It receives the form data as an object.
    *   `submitting`: A boolean flag indicating whether the form is currently being submitted.  This is used for visual feedback to the user.
    *   `asyncValidating`: A boolean flag indicating whether the form is currently being validated.  This is used for displaying error messages.
    *   `asyncBlurFields`: An array of fields that are currently being validated.  This allows for displaying error messages for specific fields.

*   **State:**

    *   `dispatch`:  A Redux action dispatcher that handles form submission and validation events.
    *   `actions`:  An object containing the actions that the component uses to handle form submission and validation.  This object is bound to the Redux store.
    *   `submitting`: A boolean flag that indicates whether the form is currently being submitted.

*   **Event Handling:**

    *   `onSubmit`:  The `handleSubmit` function's `onSubmit` prop is bound to the `this` context.  This ensures that the `handleSubmit` function is called when the form is submitted.
    *   `submit`:  The `submitting` flag triggers the `submit` event, which is handled by the `handleSubmit` function.

*   **Rendering:**

    *   The component renders a form with the specified `fields` and `children`.
    *   The `FormGroup` is used to collect the form data.
    *   The `Button` is used to submit the form.
    *   The `Link` component is used to navigate to the login page.

*   **Validation:**

    *   The `validator` library is used to validate the form data.
    *   The `validate` function checks if each field is present and meets the specified criteria (e.g., length, email format).
    *   If validation fails, an error message is displayed.

**3. Component Interface Specifications**

*   **Props:**

    *   `fields`: An object containing the required fields for the signup form.  The object's keys are the field names (e.g., "name", "email", "password").  The values are the corresponding field types (e.g., "string", "email", "string").
    *   `handleSubmit`: A function that handles form submission. It receives the form data as an object.
    *   `submitting`: A boolean flag indicating whether the form is currently being submitted.
    *   `asyncValidating`: A boolean flag indicating whether the form is currently being validated.
    *   `asyncBlurFields`: An array of fields that are currently being validated.

*   **Validation Rules:**

    *   **Name:**  The name field must be between 3 and 60 characters long.
    *   **Email:** The email field must be a valid email address.
    *   **Password:** The password field must be at least 6 characters long.

*   **Form Field Types:**

    *   `name`: String
    *   `email`: String
    *   `password`: String

*   **Default Values:**  (None explicitly defined, but the component can be configured to use default values for optional fields.)

*   **Accessibility:**

    *   The component uses `Input` with `hasFeedback` and `bsStyle` to provide visual feedback to the user when an input field is focused or when validation fails.
    *   Keyboard navigation is supported through the `Input` element.

**4. Usage Documentation**

*   **Example Implementation:**

    ```javascript
    // Example usage (simplified)
    import React from 'react';
    import Signup from './Signup';

    function MyComponent() {
      const { handleSubmit, submitting, asyncValidating, asyncBlurFields } = Signup;

      const handleFormSubmit = (data) => {
        console.log('Form submitted:', data);
        // Perform actions after form submission
      };

      return (
        <div>
          <Signup
            fields={['name', 'email', 'password']}
            handleSubmit={handleFormSubmit}
            submitting={submitting}
            asyncValidating={asyncValidating}
            asyncBlurFields={asyncBlurFields}
          />
        </div>
      );
    }

    export default MyComponent;
    ```

*   **Integration:**  The `Signup` component can be integrated into a React application using a Redux store.  The `handleSubmit` function will be called when the form is submitted.  The `submitting` flag will be set to `true` when the form is being submitted.  The `asyncValidating` flag will be set to `true` when the form is being validated.  The `asyncBlurFields` array will be populated with the fields that are currently being validated.

*   **Recommended Prop Configurations:**

    *   `fields`:  An object containing the required fields for the signup form.
    *   `handleSubmit`:  A function that handles form submission.
    *   `submitting`:  A boolean flag indicating whether the form is currently being submitted.
    *   `asyncValidating`: A boolean flag indicating whether the form is currently being validated.
    *   `asyncBlurFields`: An array of fields that are currently being validated.

**5. Accessibility Considerations**

*   **ARIA Attributes:**  The component utilizes `Input` with `hasFeedback` and `bsStyle` to provide visual feedback to the user.
*   **Keyboard Navigation:**  The `Input` element is fully navigable using the keyboard.
*   **Screen Reader Compatibility:**  The component is designed to be compatible with screen readers, providing appropriate semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.

**6. Conclusion**

The `Signup` component provides a robust and well-documented solution for handling user registration in a React application.  The clear separation of concerns, use of Redux for state management, and adherence to best practices contribute to a maintainable and scalable codebase.  This documentation provides a solid foundation for developers to understand and utilize the component effectively.
