# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The code has a critical bug that would prevent it from working. In the `fetchCharacters` function, it attempts to use `axios` without importing it. The import statement for axios is missing, which would cause a runtime error.
  
  Additionally, the response structure from SWAPI is not correctly handled. The SWAPI API returns data in the format `{ results: [...] }` where the actual character array is in the `results` property, but the code is trying to set `response.data` directly to `setCharacters`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The code includes a loading state that is initially set to `true` and is set to `false` after the API call completes. It also renders a loading message when the loading state is true.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  Due to the incorrect handling of the API response structure (not accessing the `results` property), characters would not be properly displayed even if the axios issue were fixed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  The application does not include any search functionality or user input fields.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  The code attempts to display each character's name using a map function, though it would not work correctly due to the API response handling issue.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The solution mentions using Create React App with the command `npx create-react-app swapi-frontend`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The application uses React's useState hooks to manage loading, error, and character data states appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each character list item has a key attribute set to `character.name`, which should be unique.

- **Fail** (80%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  While the code does handle loading and error states, it doesn't explicitly handle an empty character list state (e.g., when the API returns no results). This is a minor issue, as an empty array would simply render nothing, but it would be better to show a message indicating no characters were found.
