# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The provided code calls the SWAPI endpoint (https://swapi.dev/api/people) and assigns response.data directly to the characters state. However, SWAPI’s response structure typically returns an object with a “results” property that contains the list of characters. As a result, the application may not correctly display the list of characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The code correctly manages a loading state using the “loading” state variable and conditionally renders a “Loading characters…” message while data is being fetched.

- **Fail** (95%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  Because the code sets the characters state using response.data instead of response.data.results, not all characters (or the intended array of characters) may be rendered in the UI.  
  (There is a 5% uncertainty due to potential differences in the API response that might vary under some conditions, but according to standard SWAPI response format, this is not handled properly.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  The application does not implement any search or additional user input; it only displays data from the API.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each list item displays the character’s name in a <strong> tag along with the URL, satisfying this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The setup instructions indicate the use of Create React App, and the overall project structure reflects that.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The code uses useState for “characters”, “loading”, and “error” with proper handling in the fetch function and in the render logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  Each list item uses the character’s name as a key, which, assuming character names are unique, satisfies the requirement.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  The code does not explicitly handle the case when the fetched character array is empty (e.g., displaying a “No characters found” message). It would simply render an empty list.  
  (I am 10% less confident here because some may consider an empty list display as sufficient handling in basic scenarios; however, explicit user feedback is generally recommended.)
