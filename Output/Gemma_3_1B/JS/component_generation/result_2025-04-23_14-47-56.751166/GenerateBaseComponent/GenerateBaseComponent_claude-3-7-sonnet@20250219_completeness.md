# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element

    The component does attempt to render a dropdown, but it has several implementation issues. It uses a standard HTML `<select>` element wrapped in styled components, but the code contains incorrect event handlers like `onEnter`, `onOpen`, and `onClose` which don't exist as native DOM events for select elements.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown

    The component doesn't implement an actual search input within the dropdown. While there is a `searchTerm` state and a `handleSearch` function, there's no text input field rendered in the component that would allow the user to type a search query.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown

    While the component has a `selectedItem` state variable, the implementation has issues. The `onChange` handler attached to the select element is calling `handleSearch` rather than updating the `selectedItem` state.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys

    There is no specific implementation for keyboard arrow key navigation. Standard HTML `<select>` elements support this natively, but the code contains custom event handlers with incorrect event properties that would interfere with native functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key

    The component attempts to handle Enter key press with the `handleEnter` function, but it's attached to non-existent `onEnter` event handlers. The proper implementation would require a keyboard event listener for the Enter key.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused

    The component includes a `handleEnter` function, but it's implementing focus behavior rather than toggling dropdown visibility. Additionally, it's attached to non-existent `onEnter` event handlers.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes

    The code does attempt to implement focus management with the `dropdownRef` and functions like `handleClose`, but the implementation has issues with non-existent event handlers. The intent appears to be correct, but the execution is flawed.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click

    There's no specific implementation for closing the dropdown on item selection. The standard HTML `<select>` would do this natively, but the custom handlers like `handleInside` are incorrectly implemented and would interfere with native behavior.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard

    There's no specific implementation for closing the dropdown on keyboard selection. The code attempts to handle keyboard interactions but uses non-existent event handlers.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed

    There is no implementation for handling the Escape key to close the dropdown.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component

    While there is a `handleOutside` function, it's attached to the `onBlur` event of the dropdown container. This might partially work but isn't the standard approach for detecting clicks outside a component (which typically uses a click listener on the document).

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused

    The component attempts to handle Enter key press with the `handleEnter` function, but it only tries to focus the element rather than toggling the dropdown's open state. Additionally, it's attached to a non-existent `onEnter` event handler.
