# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
   The component renders a styled <select> element (SelectableDropdown) with multiple <option> elements, which serves as a dropdown UI element.

2. **Fail** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
   Although the component maintains a state variable (searchTerm) and provides an onChange handler (handleSearch), it does not render any dedicated search input element. The component only displays a <select> element without a text input field for searching.

3. **Fail** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
   The component provides a state variable (selectedItem) to hold the selected item and sets it as the value for the select element; however, the onChange handler (handleSearch) modifies the search term instead of updating selectedItem. As a result, the dropdown does not properly update the selection.

4. **Pass** (80%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
   The component is built on a standard HTML <select> element, which by default supports keyboard navigation (e.g., using the arrow keys). However, no custom implementation has been provided, and reliance on native behavior means there is minor uncertainty on whether all intended accessibility enhancements are met.

5. **Fail** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
   The code attempts to handle an Enter key event by providing an onEnter prop, but standard HTML elements do not have an onEnter event. Therefore, selecting an item with the Enter key is not reliably implemented.

6. **Fail** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
   The component includes onEnter and onOpen props aiming to handle Enter key interactions; however, these props are not part of standard React or HTML select element events. As a result, toggling visibility via the Enter key is not effectively supported.

7. **Fail** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
   Although the code includes focus management functions (handleEnter and handleOpen call dropdownRef.current.focus()), the event handlers attached (onEnter, onOpen, onClose) are nonstandard. Moreover, the onBlur (handleOutside) triggers a blur rather than refocusing the select element. There is no clear mechanism that ensures the focus returns to the select component upon closing.

8. **Fail** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
   The component does not attach any event handler specific to mouse clicks on the dropdown items that would trigger the closing of the dropdown. Instead, it relies on onChange on the <select> element, which in this implementation only changes the search term rather than closing the dropdown.

9. **Fail** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
   Similar to the previous step, there is no implementation that explicitly causes the dropdown to close when an item is selected via keyboard input. The provided event handlers do not properly implement this functionality.

10. **Fail** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
    There is no event handler that listens for the Escape key (or equivalent keyboard event) to close the dropdown. As such, the functionality to close the dropdown with Escape is missing.

11. **Pass** (80%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
    The component attaches an onBlur event handler (handleOutside) to the DropdownContainer, which calls dropdownRef.current.blur() when it loses focus. This should cause the dropdown to close when a user clicks outside of it. However, since the component relies on nonstandard onBlur behavior and custom event handlers, there is some uncertainty on complete consistency across browsers.

12. **Fail** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
    Even though the component includes onEnter and onOpen handlers intended to open the dropdown on an Enter key press, these are not standard events on HTML elements, meaning the dropdown will not reliably open on an Enter key press.
