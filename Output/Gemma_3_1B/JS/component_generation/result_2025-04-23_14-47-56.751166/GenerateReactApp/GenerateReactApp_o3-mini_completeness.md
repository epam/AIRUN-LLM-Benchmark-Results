# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (95%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The code attempts to render a list by mapping over the state variable “characters.” However, the API endpoint (https://swapi.dev/api/people) returns an object with a “results” property that contains the array of characters. Since the code uses response.data directly (rather than response.data.results), the list may not display correctly unless the API response is transformed. This mismatch causes a failure in reliably displaying the expected list.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The component checks the “loading” state and returns <div>Loading characters...</div> while the data is being fetched. This behavior meets the requirement for a visual loading indicator.

- **Fail** (95%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  Because the response data is not correctly transformed (i.e., not extracting the “results” array), the mapping over “characters” might not reflect the actual list of characters from the API. This will prevent the proper display of all characters as intended.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  There is no code implementing search functionality or any user input elements. The application focuses solely on fetching and displaying character data.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each list item displays the character’s name (wrapped in a <strong> tag) along with its URL. This meets the requirement for displaying character names alongside additional data.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The instructions include using Create React App for project setup, and the provided project structure is consistent with that approach.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The code manages three distinct states (loading, error, and characters) using React’s useState, enabling appropriate conditionals during the component’s lifecycle.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  The code uses the character’s name as the key in the list mapping. While using the name assumes uniqueness (which is likely acceptable for this example), it does fulfill the requirement for providing keys for list items.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  The code does not have an explicit handling mechanism (such as a custom message) for the case when the fetched data is empty. Although it would naturally render an empty list, an explicit empty state message would enhance the user experience. This omission is noted as a failure to robustly handle empty data states.  
  (Confidence is slightly less than 100% because, in some cases, an empty list might be acceptable; however, best practices suggest an explicit indication for empty data.)
