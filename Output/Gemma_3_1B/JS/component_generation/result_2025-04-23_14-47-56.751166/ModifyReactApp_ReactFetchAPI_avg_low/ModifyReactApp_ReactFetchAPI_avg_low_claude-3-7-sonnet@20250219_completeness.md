# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name

    The code doesn't include any search input field in the UI. While there is a `searchTerm` state variable and filtering logic, there's no actual input element (`<input>` or similar) that allows users to enter a search term.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests

    The code includes a loading state and displays a "Loading..." message when the data is being fetched:
    ```tsx
    if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query

    The code correctly uses useEffect with an empty dependency array to fetch data on component mount:
    ```tsx
    useEffect(() => {
        // Initial search - no filtering needed
        fetchCharacters();
    }, []);
    ```

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type

    There's a critical error in the code's search implementation. The filtering logic is placed directly in the render function (outside any event handler) which would cause an infinite loop when trying to set state during render:
    ```tsx
    if (searchTerm) {
        // Perform a simple search -  adjust the query as needed
        const searchTermLower = searchTerm.toLowerCase();
        const results = characters.filter((character) =>
            character.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTermLower)
        );
        setCharacters(results); // This will cause infinite re-renders
    }
    ```
    Additionally, there's no input element for users to type in, nor is there any event handler to capture typing events.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found

    The code doesn't provide any visual feedback when search results are empty. There's no conditional rendering that shows a "No results found" message when the characters array is empty after filtering.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design

    There are no CSS/styling properties or responsive design elements in the provided code. The UI is very basic without any responsive design considerations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response

    The component does display the character list after the API response:
    ```tsx
    return (
        <ul>
            {characters.map((character) => (
                <li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>
            ))}
        </ul>
    );
    ```
    However, the search filtering logic has issues as mentioned earlier.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed

    The code has a try-catch block for the API request, but it doesn't implement React Error Boundaries to gracefully handle runtime errors in components.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props

    The code correctly defines TypeScript interfaces for the data:
    ```tsx
    interface Character {
        name: string;
        url: string;
    }
    ```
    And it properly types the component and state variables:
    ```tsx
    const CharacterList: React.FC = () => {
        const [characters, setCharacters] = useState<Character[]>([]);
        const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(true);
        const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
    ```

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities

    The search implementation has a critical flaw that would cause infinite re-renders, as it's directly calling `setCharacters(results)` in the render function. This would break the original functionality of displaying all characters.
