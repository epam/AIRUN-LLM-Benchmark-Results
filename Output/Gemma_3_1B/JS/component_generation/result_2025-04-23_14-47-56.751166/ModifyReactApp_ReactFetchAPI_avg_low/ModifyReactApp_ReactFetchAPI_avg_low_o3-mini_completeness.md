# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The provided code maintains a searchTerm state but does not render any input element for the user to enter a search query. Without an input field, users cannot dynamically update the search term.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  The code correctly checks if the loading state is true and renders a "Loading..." indicator before the API call completes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  The initial API call is executed inside a useEffect with an empty dependency array, ensuring that data is fetched on mount and that the initial searchTerm (which is empty) is in place when the component mounts.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  Although the code contains a searchTerm state and filtering logic, there is no rendered mechanism (such as an input field with an onChange handler) to update searchTerm dynamically from user input, which means that dynamic updating is not properly implemented.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  The code renders a list of characters without any fallback UI. If the filtering operation results in an empty array, the user would see an empty list rather than a message like "No results found."

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  There is no evidence in the code of responsive design principles being applied (e.g., use of responsive CSS or layout techniques). This is a plain rendering of a list without any styling considerations for responsiveness.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  While the code intends to display filtered characters, the search logic is executed directly during render. Calling setCharacters within the render body (when searchTerm is non-empty) is problematic and can lead to infinite re-renders. Thus, the intended behavior of displaying search results is not correctly implemented.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  The component uses a try-catch block inside the fetchCharacters function to handle API errors, but it does not implement React error boundaries that would catch rendering errors. There is no use of ErrorBoundary components or similar mechanisms.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The code defines a proper TypeScript interface (Character) for API data. The component is typed as React.FC, which is sufficient for this example given the absence of props.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The introduction of search functionality interferes with the original data state. The filtering logic directly calls setCharacters during rendering, which modifies the state irreversibly. Furthermore, without a proper search input, the intended enhancement conflicts with the initial data-loading functionality.
