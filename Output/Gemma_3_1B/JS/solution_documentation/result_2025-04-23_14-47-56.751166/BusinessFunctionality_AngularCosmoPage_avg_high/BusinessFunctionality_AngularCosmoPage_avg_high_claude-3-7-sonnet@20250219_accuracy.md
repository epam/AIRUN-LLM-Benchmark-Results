# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies the application as an Angular.js application for web content management
  
  The documentation describes a frontend-driven system for managing pages, blocks, and related data, but it does not explicitly identify the application as an Angular.js application. While it mentions "Angular's built-in authentication system," it doesn't clearly state that the application itself is built with Angular.js. The documentation focuses on components like page.html, pageCtrl.js, and page.js which are consistent with Angular.js naming conventions, but it never makes this explicit.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately describes the REST factory for backend communication
  
  The documentation clearly describes the RESTful API endpoints in the "Backend Documentation (REST.js)" section, providing a comprehensive list of endpoints for blocks, comments, content, revisions, and tags, along with their HTTP methods and purposes.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate that the documentation correctly explains the Page factory for storing global page variables
  
  The documentation describes the 'page.js' component that handles various page-related properties and functions like page.title, page.description, page.url, etc. It explains that this component manages the user interaction and data management for pages. However, it doesn't explicitly call this a "Page factory," though the functionality described matches what a Page factory would do.

- **Fail** (80%): Verify that the documentation accurately describes the Users factory for storing current user data
  
  While the documentation briefly mentions "page.users" that "Gets the user associated with the page," it does not provide a detailed explanation of a Users factory for storing current user data. The documentation lacks information about user authentication, user roles, user management, or how user data is stored and retrieved.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation correctly explains the page controller functionality
  
  The documentation clearly explains the pageCtrl.js component's purpose and functionality, detailing various functions like page.confirm, page.savePage, page.updatePageType, and more, along with their effects on the page's state.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate that the documentation accurately explains the page creation and editing process
  
  The documentation mentions that users can create, edit, delete, and view pages as part of the Page Management feature. It also describes a form for creating new pages and buttons for actions like "Save Page", "Confirm", "Update", etc. However, it could provide more detailed step-by-step information about how the page creation and editing process works.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately describes the local storage recovery mechanism for unsaved changes
  
  The documentation does not mention any local storage recovery mechanism for unsaved changes. There is no information about how the application handles browser crashes, accidental navigation away from the page, or other scenarios where unsaved changes might be lost.

- **Pass** (85%): Confirm that the documentation correctly explains the version comparison and management features
  
  The documentation mentions "Delete Newer Version" button and "page.localVersion()" function, which suggests version management capabilities. It also discusses content revisions with endpoints like GET /content/:contentID/revisions and functions like page.contentRevisions. However, it doesn't explicitly detail how version comparison works or the full version management workflow.

- **Pass** (80%): Validate that the documentation accurately describes the page deletion workflow
  
  The documentation mentions that users can delete pages as part of the Page Management feature and includes a "Delete" button in the UI description. However, it doesn't provide a detailed workflow for page deletion, such as confirmation dialogs, handling of child elements, or permanent vs. soft deletion options.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the documentation accurately explains the auto-URL generation from title functionality
  
  The documentation mentions page.url functionality that "Gets the page's URL from the page object," indicating that URLs are generated for pages. However, it doesn't explicitly state that URLs are automatically generated from the title, though this can be inferred from the context.

- **Fail** (80%): Confirm that the documentation correctly describes the tag autocompletion and suggestion system
  
  While the documentation mentions page.tags and contentTags with corresponding API endpoints, it does not describe any tag autocompletion or suggestion system. There is no information about how tags are suggested to users or how autocompletion works during tag entry.

- **Pass** (95%): Validate that the documentation accurately explains the publication scheduling system
  
  The documentation mentions page.scheduleDate that "Gets the page's scheduled date from the page object" and page.publish that "Sets the page's published status." In the Application Overview section, it also mentions publication scheduling as a feature. This adequately describes the existence of a publication scheduling system.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that the documentation accurately describes the handling of page revisions and extras
  
  While the documentation mentions page.contentRevisions, page.contentRevisionsExtras, page.extras, and corresponding API endpoints for managing these elements, it does not provide a detailed explanation of how these revisions and extras are handled, what they consist of, or how they relate to the core page content.
