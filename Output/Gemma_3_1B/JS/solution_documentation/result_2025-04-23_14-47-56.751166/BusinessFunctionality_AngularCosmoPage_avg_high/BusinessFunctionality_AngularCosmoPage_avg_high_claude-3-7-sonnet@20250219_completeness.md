# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the documentation identifies all major components (REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, pageCtrl)

    The documentation identifies the REST factory and mentions pageCtrl, but fails to specifically identify the Page factory and Users factory as major components. While page.js is mentioned, it's not clearly indicated as the Page factory. The Users factory is only briefly mentioned in page.js functionality without being identified as a major component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the purpose of the REST factory for API communication

    The documentation clearly explains that the REST.js defines the RESTful API endpoints and that its purpose is to handle API communication. Section 3 is dedicated to explaining the REST factory's purpose for API communication.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes all API endpoints exposed in the REST factory

    The documentation provides a comprehensive list of the API endpoints in the REST factory, including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations for blocks, comments, content, content revisions, content extras, and content tags.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate the documentation explains the Page factory and its role in storing global page variables

    While the documentation mentions page.js and lists several of its functions, it doesn't explicitly identify it as the Page factory or clearly explain its role in storing global page variables. The description provided doesn't fully capture the factory pattern or the importance of global variable storage.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the Users factory and its purpose for user data management

    The documentation only briefly mentions "page.users: Gets the user associated with the page" but doesn't describe a Users factory or explain its purpose for user data management. There's no comprehensive explanation of how user data is managed within the application.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify the documentation explains the page controller's responsibilities and features

    The documentation does explain some of the page controller's responsibilities in the pageCtrl.js section, listing functions like page.confirm, page.savePage, page.updatePageType, etc. However, the explanation lacks depth on exactly how these features work and interact with other components, hence the 80% confidence.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the local storage mechanism for unsaved changes

    The documentation briefly mentions "page.localVersion()" but doesn't describe any local storage mechanism for unsaved changes. There's no explanation of how data persistence works for drafts or unsaved content.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate the documentation explains the version comparison functionality

    While the documentation mentions "Delete Newer Version" as a button in the UI, it doesn't explain any version comparison functionality. There's no description of how versions are compared or managed.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the page creation workflow

    The documentation mentions a form for creating new pages but doesn't describe the complete workflow for page creation, including the steps users need to take and how the system processes these actions.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page editing workflow

    While the documentation mentions functions like savePage and updatePageType, it doesn't provide a clear explanation of the complete page editing workflow.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the page duplication feature

    Although "Duplicate" is mentioned as one of the buttons in the UI, the documentation doesn't describe how the page duplication feature works.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate the documentation explains the page deletion process

    The documentation mentions "Delete" buttons for various elements but doesn't explain the page deletion process, including confirmations, dependencies, or data handling.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the auto-URL generation from title feature

    The documentation mentions page.url but doesn't describe any auto-URL generation feature based on the title.

- **Pass** (70%): Verify the documentation explains tag management and autocompletion

    The documentation does mention page.tags and contentTags multiple times, including endpoints for retrieving them, but doesn't specifically explain tag management processes or any autocompletion functionality, hence the 70% confidence.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the documentation describes the publication status options (publish, draft, schedule)

    The documentation mentions page.published and page.scheduleDate functions, which implies the existence of publish, draft, and schedule options. It's clear that these statuses exist, but details on how they function are limited, hence the 90% confidence.

- **Pass** (80%): Validate the documentation explains scheduled content publishing

    The documentation mentions "page.scheduleDate: Sets the page's scheduled date" and later refers to retrieving scheduled dates, which indicates scheduled content publishing functionality. However, it lacks details on how scheduling works in practice, hence the 80% confidence.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the documentation describes page revision management

    The documentation mentions content revisions multiple times, including "page.contentRevisions", API endpoints for revisions, and a "Save Revision" button, which strongly indicates revision management functionality exists. It doesn't provide complete details on how revisions are managed, hence the 90% confidence.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the documentation explains the handling of page extras and additional data

    The documentation repeatedly mentions extras, including "page.extras", "page.contentExtras", "page.contentRevisionsExtras", and API endpoints for managing extras. It clearly indicates that the application handles additional data beyond the basic page content, though specifics are limited, hence the 90% confidence.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes form validation mechanisms

    While the documentation mentions "Data Validation" as a key business requirement, it doesn't describe any specific form validation mechanisms implemented in the application.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate the documentation explains error handling during API operations

    The documentation mentions error handling as a "Future Consideration" but doesn't explain current error handling during API operations.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes notification messaging for user feedback

    The documentation doesn't describe any notification messaging system for providing feedback to users.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the theme-specific page types feature

    While the documentation mentions "page.themePages: Handles the page's theme", it doesn't explain any theme-specific page types feature in detail.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the featured image handling

    The documentation doesn't describe any featured image handling functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate the documentation explains URL validation and error handling

    The documentation mentions page.url but doesn't explain any URL validation or related error handling.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the tag suggestion system based on user input

    The documentation mentions tags but doesn't describe any tag suggestion system based on user input.
