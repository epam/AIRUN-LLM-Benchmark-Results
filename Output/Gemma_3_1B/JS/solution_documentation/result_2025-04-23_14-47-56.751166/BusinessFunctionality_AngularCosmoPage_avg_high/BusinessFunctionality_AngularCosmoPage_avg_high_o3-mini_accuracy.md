# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass** (90%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies the application as an Angular.js application for web content management  
   The documentation refers to Angular's built-in authentication system and includes frontend components (page.html, pageCtrl.js, page.js) that are typical in AngularJS projects. However, it does not explicitly state “Angular.js,” so there is a slight uncertainty.

2. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately describes the REST factory for backend communication  
   The documentation covers the RESTful API endpoints in the Backend Documentation (REST.js) section but does not describe an Angular REST factory. The expected description of a REST factory in an Angular context is not provided.

3. **Fail** (100%): Validate that the documentation correctly explains the Page factory for storing global page variables  
   There is no mention of a Page factory. Although the documentation discusses several page-related files, it does not explicitly describe a factory dedicated to storing global page variables.

4. **Fail** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately describes the Users factory for storing current user data  
   The documentation only briefly refers to "page.users" and does not include a dedicated section or clear details on a Users factory for managing current user data.

5. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation correctly explains the page controller functionality  
   The documentation provides a clear explanation of the role of pageCtrl.js, detailing the various functions (such as page.confirm, page.savePage, etc.) that manage user interactions and update the page state.

6. **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation accurately explains the page creation and editing process  
   The documentation describes the components involved (page.html, pageCtrl.js, page.js) and explains how pages are created, edited, and saved, satisfying this criterion.

7. **Fail** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately describes the local storage recovery mechanism for unsaved changes  
   There is no mention of any local storage recovery mechanism or how unsaved changes might be handled in the provided documentation.

8. **Fail** (90%): Confirm that the documentation correctly explains the version comparison and management features  
   While the documentation mentions buttons like “Delete Newer Version” and functions such as page.localVersion(), it does not provide a detailed explanation of how version comparison or management is performed. This lack of detailed explanation leads to a failure on this step.

9. **Fail** (100%): Validate that the documentation accurately describes the page deletion workflow  
   Although deletion buttons (e.g., “Delete Newer Version”, “Delete Extras”, “Delete Tags”) are listed, the documentation does not provide a comprehensive explanation of the overall page deletion workflow.

10. **Fail** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately explains the auto-URL generation from title functionality  
    There is no information in the documentation about any auto-URL generation feature based on the page title.

11. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the documentation correctly describes the tag autocompletion and suggestion system  
    The documentation does not mention any tag autocompletion or suggestion system details.

12. **Pass** (90%): Validate that the documentation accurately explains the publication scheduling system  
    The documentation touches on publication scheduling by referring to page.scheduleDate and describing scheduled publication aspects, although it could benefit from more detail.

13. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately describes the handling of page revisions and extras  
    The documentation covers page revisions and extras thoroughly in both the Frontend Documentation (page.js) and the Backend Documentation (REST.js) by listing the corresponding endpoints and functions.
