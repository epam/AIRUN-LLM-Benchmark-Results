# Evaluation Report

1. **Fail** (100%): Ensure the documentation identifies all major components (REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, pageCtrl)  
   The documentation details page.html, pageCtrl.js, page.js, and REST.js but does not mention a dedicated REST factory, Page factory, or Users factory. Only the page controller (pageCtrl) is adequately described.

2. **Fail** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the purpose of the REST factory for API communication  
   Although the REST API endpoints are documented in the REST.js section, the documentation does not explain a “REST factory” or its role in handling API communication.

3. **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes all API endpoints exposed in the REST factory  
   The REST.js section provides a comprehensive list of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints covering pages, blocks, comments, content, revisions, extras, and tags.

4. **Fail** (100%): Validate the documentation explains the Page factory and its role in storing global page variables  
   There is no mention of a Page factory. The documentation describes components such as page.html, pageCtrl.js, and page.js (referring to the “page” object), but it does not explicitly define a Page factory or its purpose.

5. **Fail** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the Users factory and its purpose for user data management  
   While user authentication is mentioned briefly in the business requirements and the page object includes a “users” property, there is no dedicated explanation of a Users factory.

6. **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page controller's responsibilities and features  
   The pageCtrl.js section clearly states its purpose in handling user interactions and updating the page state with functions like page.confirm, page.savePage, page.updatePageType, etc.

7. **Fail** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the local storage mechanism for unsaved changes  
   There is no discussion of a local storage mechanism or a strategy for handling unsaved changes. The mention of page.localVersion() does not equate to an explanation of unsaved changes storage.

8. **Fail** (100%): Validate the documentation explains the version comparison functionality  
   The documentation hints at version management with page.localVersion() but does not elaborate on version comparison or how it is implemented.

9. **Fail** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the page creation workflow  
   Although a “New Page” form is mentioned in page.html, the documentation lacks a clear description of the complete page creation workflow (from initiation to saving).

10. **Fail** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page editing workflow  
    The editing process is only briefly mentioned (e.g., “edit page”) without a detailed description of the steps or validations involved in editing a page.

11. **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the page duplication feature  
    A "Duplicate" button is noted in page.html. While the explanation is minimal, the existence of the page duplication feature is explicitly indicated.

12. **Fail** (100%): Validate the documentation explains the page deletion process  
    The documentation briefly lists deletion actions (e.g., “delete a page”, “Delete extras”, “Delete tags”) but does not provide a detailed explanation of the page deletion workflow.

13. **Fail** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the auto-URL generation from title feature  
    There is no information on how URLs might be automatically generated from a page title, despite the presence of a page.url field.

14. **Fail** (100%): Verify the documentation explains tag management and autocompletion  
    While tags are mentioned (e.g., page.tags, update tags), there is no discussion of tag autocompletion or a detailed tag management system.

15. **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the publication status options (publish, draft, schedule)  
    The documentation refers to publication status with mentions of page.published and page.scheduleDate, and the business requirements note aspects like draft and scheduled content.

16. **Fail** (100%): Validate the documentation explains scheduled content publishing  
    Although page.scheduleDate is mentioned, there is no detailed explanation of how scheduled publishing is handled or its workflow.

17. **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes page revision management  
    The documentation includes page.contentRevisions and REST API endpoints for content revisions, covering the management of page revisions.

18. **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the handling of page extras and additional data  
    Both page.js and the REST API documentation mention extras (e.g., page.extras, contentRevisionsExtras, contentTags), indicating that additional data handling is considered.

19. **Fail** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes form validation mechanisms  
    Although data validation is mentioned in the business requirements, the documentation does not provide details on how form validation is implemented or enforced.

20. **Fail** (100%): Validate the documentation explains error handling during API operations  
    The discussion of error handling is limited to a future consideration for more robust error handling and logging rather than an explanation of the current mechanism.

21. **Fail** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes notification messaging for user feedback  
    There is no mention of how notification messaging or user feedback is handled within the documentation.

22. **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the theme-specific page types feature  
    The documentation mentions “page.themePages” in the page controller section, indicating that theme-specific page types are supported.

23. **Fail** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the featured image handling  
    There is no mention of handling featured images or any functionality related to image management specifically.

24. **Fail** (100%): Validate the documentation explains URL validation and error handling  
    While a page.url is present, the documentation lacks any explanation of URL validation methods or error handling strategies specific to URLs.

25. **Fail** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the tag suggestion system based on user input  
    The documentation does not include any discussion of a tag suggestion system or how suggestions are generated based on user input.
