# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the document covers all main functionality including adding, editing, deleting, and toggling todos  
  Although the overview claims support for deletion (via the "Clear Completed" button) along with adding, editing, and toggling, the documentation does not provide in‚Äêdepth details about the deletion process. The main functionalities are mentioned but lack detailed workflow explanations for deletion. My confidence is 90% because while deletion is mentioned, its implementation is not explained as thoroughly as the others.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about filtering todos by status (all, active, completed)  
  The document clearly explains that users can filter tasks by completion status using routes (e.g., `/`, `/active`, `/completed`).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the user workflow for creating new todo items  
  The user interaction flow explains how a task is added by entering text and pressing Enter, which satisfies this step.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure the document covers the editing functionality triggered by double-clicking  
  While the document covers editing via functions like handleEdit and handleSave, it does not explicitly mention that editing is triggered by a double-click, which is a typical behavior in many todo applications. This omission leads to the failure of this step.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the clear completed functionality  
  The documentation mentions a "Clear Completed" button and its role in handling task deletion/completion, which is sufficient.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the toggle all functionality  
  The handleToggleAll function and its purpose in the UI are described, so this aspect is covered.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the document covers the counter for remaining items  
  There is no explicit mention of how the application displays the number of remaining items (the counter), which is a common feature in todo apps. Therefore, this step has failed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the persistent storage of todos  
  The documentation clearly states that localStorage and the store function in utils.ts are used to persist data.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the UI components and their relationships  
  A detailed breakdown of app.tsx, TodoItem.tsx, and utils.ts is provided, illustrating the component relationships and structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the business objectives addressed by the application  
  The "Application Overview & Business Requirements" section clearly lists the core features and objectives of the application.

- **Fail** (95%): Verify the document includes performance and scalability considerations  
  The documentation remarks on performance in the context of the shouldComponentUpdate method, but it does not explicitly address scalability considerations. This step is therefore only partially met.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the document describes technical constraints and limitations  
  No discussion of technical constraints or limitations is present in the document, leading to a failure in this step.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the pluralization of item/items text based on count  
  The presence of the pluralize function in utils.ts is noted in the documentation, adequately covering this requirement.
