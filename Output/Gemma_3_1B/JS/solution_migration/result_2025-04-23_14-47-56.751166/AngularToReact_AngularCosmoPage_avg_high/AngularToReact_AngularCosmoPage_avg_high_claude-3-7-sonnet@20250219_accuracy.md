# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props

    The provided answer mentions TypeScript is "essential" but doesn't include any actual TypeScript implementation. There are no type definitions, interfaces, or TypeScript syntax shown in the response. The answer only conceptually acknowledges the importance of TypeScript but fails to demonstrate its implementation.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management

    While the answer mentions "Redux Toolkit" as the recommended approach, it doesn't show any implementation using Redux Toolkit's createSlice or other RTK features. The state management section simply describes recreating the existing state in a general fashion without showing RTK-specific code.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components

    The answer doesn't include any React component implementations at all. There are no functional components with hooks demonstrated in the response.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately

    The answer doesn't include any implementation of React hooks. No useState, useEffect, useCallback, or useMemo hooks are shown in the response.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource

    The answer lists various API endpoints but doesn't demonstrate implementation with fetch or axios. It simply mentions route paths without showing the actual API client implementation.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components

    The answer doesn't show any form implementation with controlled components. It only conceptually mentions the existing Angular form structure without demonstrating React controlled component implementation.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation

    The answer doesn't mention or demonstrate React Router implementation for navigation.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization

    The answer doesn't mention or demonstrate any internationalization implementation or library recommendation.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization

    While the answer briefly mentions code splitting as a performance technique in the "Performance" section, it doesn't demonstrate or explain how code splitting would be implemented.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations

    The answer doesn't mention or demonstrate the use of React.memo for component optimization.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks

    The answer doesn't include any implementation of React hooks, so there are no dependency arrays to evaluate.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models

    The answer doesn't include any TypeScript interfaces or type definitions for data models.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state

    The answer doesn't demonstrate or mention the use of Redux selectors for accessing state.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations

    The answer doesn't demonstrate implementation of Redux action creators for state mutations.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks

    The answer mentions "saveLocal" as an event handler to implement but doesn't demonstrate how local storage would be handled in React using appropriate hooks.
