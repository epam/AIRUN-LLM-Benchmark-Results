# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented

    The answer discusses general state management techniques but does not specifically detail how page creation, updating, deletion, and duplication would be implemented in the React/Redux version. It mentions `savePageRevision` as an event handler that would need to be handled but doesn't explain how this would be implemented in the new architecture.

    I'm 90% confident because while the answer references updating page properties (title, description, etc.), it doesn't clearly outline the full CRUD functionality implementation.

- **Fail** (95%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present

    The answer mentions `$scope.updatePageType` as a "crucial event handler" that would need to be handled in the React version, but it doesn't provide details on how page type selection would be implemented. It mentions `state.type` but doesn't describe the UI components or logic for type selection.

    I'm 95% confident because the answer acknowledges the need for type handling but doesn't address the actual implementation.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists

    While the answer mentions `$scope.autoURL = false` and `state.autoURL = false` as initial states, it does not describe any implementation for automatically generating URLs from titles. This is a specific functionality mentioned in the evaluation step that is completely missing from the answer.

- **Fail** (90%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented

    The answer mentions tags in several places (`$scope.tags`, `state.tags`, `$scope.contentTags`, `$scope.deleteTags`), but it doesn't describe how tag management would be implemented, particularly the autocomplete suggestions functionality.

    I'm 90% confident because while tags are mentioned several times, there is no specific implementation detail for tag management with autocomplete.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available

    The answer mentions `$scope.published` and `state.published`, but it doesn't detail how different publish status options would be implemented in the React version. There is no discussion of UI components or state management for handling publish, draft, and schedule options.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented

    The answer mentions `$scope.published_date` and `state.published_date`, but doesn't provide any implementation details for scheduled publishing functionality.

    I'm 90% confident because while the published date is mentioned, there is no description of how scheduling would work.

- **Fail** (95%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present

    The answer mentions `$scope.saveLocal` as an event handler that would need to be handled, but it doesn't provide details on how local storage version comparison and restoration would be implemented in React/Redux.

    I'm 95% confident because while the answer acknowledges local storage saving, it doesn't address the comparison and restoration features.

- **Fail** (80%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented

    The answer mentions `$scope.notify` as a "crucial event handler" but doesn't describe how the notification system would be implemented in React.

    I'm 80% confident because while notifications are mentioned, there could be implicit implementation in the error handling section, though it's not specifically tied to the original notification system.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present

    The answer does not address form validation for required fields at all. There is no mention of validation logic or UI feedback for required fields like URL and page type.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled

    The answer provides a detailed breakdown of API endpoints that need to be included, with specific GET routes for blocks, requirements, comments, content, revisions, tags, and more. This appears to cover the necessary API endpoints.

    I'm 90% confident because while the API endpoints are listed comprehensively, there's no clear mapping to how they would be called from React components.

- **Fail** (95%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented

    The answer mentions extras in several places (`$scope.extras`, `state.extras`, `$scope.deleteExtras`, `$scope.deleteExtrasExtras`), but it doesn't provide implementation details for how extras management would work in the React version.

    I'm 95% confident because while extras are mentioned repeatedly, there is no clear implementation plan.

- **Fail** (95%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained

    The answer mentions content revisions in several places (`$scope.contentRevisions`, `state.contentRevisions`), but doesn't provide details on how revision history functionality would be implemented in React/Redux.

    I'm 95% confident because revisions are mentioned but without implementation details.

- **Fail** (80%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components

    While the answer mentions "Component-Based Architecture" as a principle and suggests breaking down the application into smaller, reusable components, it doesn't provide a specific folder structure or clear separation of business logic from UI components.

    I'm 80% confident because the answer mentions architectural principles but doesn't detail the actual organization.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved

    The answer does not mention translation functionality at all. There is no discussion of how internationalization/localization would be handled in the React version.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters

    The answer does not address URL structure or routing parameters in the React migration. There is no discussion of how the application would handle routing or maintain URL compatibility.
