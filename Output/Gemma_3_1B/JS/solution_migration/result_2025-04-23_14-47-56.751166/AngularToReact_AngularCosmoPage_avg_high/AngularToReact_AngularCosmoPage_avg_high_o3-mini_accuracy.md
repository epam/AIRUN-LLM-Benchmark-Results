# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props  
  The answer emphasizes that "TypeScript is Crucial" but does not provide any evidence or examples that demonstrate the actual use of TypeScript with strict typing. No type annotations or interfaces are provided.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management  
  Although Redux Toolkit is mentioned as the recommended approach, there is no indication that createSlice or any Redux Toolkit-specific constructs are actually used or implemented in the proposal.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components  
  The answer talks about a component-based architecture and even mentions creating a Page component, but it does not specify that these components are functional. There is no explicit reference to functional component patterns or hooks.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately  
  There is no mention of any React hooks (e.g., useState or useEffect) in the plan. The proposal does not demonstrate how component state or lifecycle events will be managed using hooks.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource  
  While the answer lists various API endpoints and operations, it does not specify the usage of modern HTTP libraries (such as fetch or axios) for communicating with the backend, nor does it address the deprecation of $resource.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components  
  There is no discussion or example regarding form handling. The answer does not indicate an approach using React controlled components for handling user input in forms.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation  
  The answer does not mention React Router or any routing mechanism; therefore, there is no evidence of navigation management within the React application.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization  
  The response does not mention any internationalization libraries or strategies, so it fails to address this requirement.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization  
  Although code splitting is briefly mentioned as a performance optimization technique, there is no concrete example or strategy provided to demonstrate its implementation.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations  
  There is no mention of performance optimizations such as the usage of React.memo for expensive or memoizable components.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks  
  Since no React hooks (such as useEffect) are mentioned in the plan, there is no evidence that dependency arrays are being used appropriately.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models  
  The answer does not include or reference any TypeScript interfaces for data models, failing to demonstrate structured and typed data definitions.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state  
  There is no mention of Redux selectors or any mechanism for selectively accessing state from the Redux store.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations  
  Although state management is discussed in a general sense, the answer does not provide details on how action creators will be implemented or used for state mutations.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks  
  The answer briefly references a handler named "saveLocal" but does not explain or show how local storage functionality will be integrated, particularly not through any specialized hooks.
