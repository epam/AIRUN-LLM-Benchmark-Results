# Evaluation Report

Below is the evaluation of the provided answer against the evaluation steps.

1. **Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented**  
   **Fail** (95%): The answer describes many event handlers (e.g. save, update, and delete functions for various page properties) which cover update and delete. However, there is no explicit mention of “create” or “duplicate” functionality. This omission leads to a failing assessment for complete page management.

2. **Verify that page type selection functionality is present**  
   **Pass** (100%): The answer clearly mentions the “updatePageType” event handler and related state properties, indicating that page type selection is taken into account.

3. **Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists**  
   **Pass** (100%): The provided plan refers to managing the URL (via “autoURL”, “page.url”, etc.) which implies that auto-generation and management of URLs from the title is considered.

4. **Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented**  
   **Fail** (95%): Although there are several handlers related to tags (e.g. “deleteTags”, “contentTags”), the answer does not mention any autocomplete suggestion feature. The absence of specific reference to autocomplete causes this step to fail.

5. **Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available**  
   **Pass** (90%): The answer includes properties like “published” and “published_date” which suggest that various publishing states are considered. However, it does not explicitly list the options “draft” or “schedule.” Despite this, the implication is strong enough to merit a pass with slightly reduced confidence.

6. **Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented**  
   **Pass** (100%): The “published_date” property is clearly maintained in the plan, which supports the capability for scheduled publishing.

7. **Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present**  
   **Fail** (90%): The answer contains a “saveLocal” event handler, hinting at local storage usage for saving data. However, there is no clear mention or explanation of comparing local versions or restoring from them, so this functionality appears missing or incomplete.

8. **Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented**  
   **Pass** (100%): The plan includes a “notify” event handler, which is dedicated to handling notifications. This indicates that the notification system is taken into account.

9. **Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present**  
   **Fail** (95%): There is no mention of explicit form validation for required fields such as URL or page type in the answer. Without a clear reference to validation logic, this step is not met.

10. **Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled**  
    **Pass** (100%): The answer provides an extensive list of API endpoints (for blocks, content, revisions, tags, etc.) along with suggestions for their migration. This indicates that the API endpoints are thoroughly considered and mapped.

11. **Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented**  
    **Pass** (100%): The answer includes several references to “extras” (e.g. deleteExtras, contentRevisionsExtras, extras properties) indicating that extras management is part of the plan.

12. **Validate that revision history functionality is maintained**  
    **Pass** (100%): The detailed plan includes various event handlers for “contentRevisions” and related extra information, showing that revision history is maintained.

13. **Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components**  
    **Pass** (95%): While the answer does not provide an explicit folder structure diagram, it clearly distinguishes between frontend components, API endpoints, and state management (Redux), indicating a separation of concerns. This organizational strategy is in line with the requirement.

14. **Verify that all translation functionality is preserved**  
    **Fail** (90%): There is no mention of any translation or internationalization features in the plan. Therefore, it appears that translation functionality is not addressed or preserved.

15. **Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters**  
    **Fail** (90%): Although the answer mentions “page.url” and various routing elements conceptually, it does not explicitly state that the same URL structure and query parameters will be maintained during the migration.
