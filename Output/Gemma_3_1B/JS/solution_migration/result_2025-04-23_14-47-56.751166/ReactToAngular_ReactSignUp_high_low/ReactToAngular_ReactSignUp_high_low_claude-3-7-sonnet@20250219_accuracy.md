# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling

    The code snippet includes references to FormGroup and FormInput, but there's a fundamental misunderstanding of Angular's Reactive Forms implementation. The import statement `import { FormGroup, FormInput, Button, Link } from '@angular/forms';` is incorrect as FormInput, Button, and Link are not part of @angular/forms. The proper implementation would use FormBuilder, FormGroup, and FormControl from @angular/forms, and the form would be initialized in the component class.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)

    The code doesn't include any actual validation logic for these requirements. There's a mention of a `validate` function in the description but no actual implementation is provided. The code should include Validators from Angular's forms module with specific validation rules.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use

    While there's a mention of `asyncValidate` function and `checkEmail` and `checkName` functions in the description, no actual implementation is provided. Angular asynchronous validators should be implemented using specific patterns with Observables.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched

    The form implementation doesn't include any logic for showing validation feedback. The template doesn't have conditional classes or indicators based on form control states.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions

    The handleSubmit method is empty in the component code, and there's no implementation of any API service call or action dispatching.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails

    The form template doesn't include any error message display elements or logic for showing validation messages.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service

    There's no mention or implementation of Angular's Title service in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management

    While Redux is mentioned in the description, there's no concrete implementation of @ngrx/store or @ngrx/effects in the provided code. The actions property in the component is incorrectly defined and doesn't follow NGRX patterns.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress

    There's no implementation to disable the submit button during form submission.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses

    There's no API call implementation to evaluate this requirement.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management

    The component structure is fundamentally flawed. The actions property is incorrectly defined, there's no proper initialization of the form, and important Angular lifecycle hooks are missing.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises

    While HttpClient is mentioned in the description, there's no actual implementation showing its usage.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements

    There's no implementation of error message display or specific error messages in the provided code.
