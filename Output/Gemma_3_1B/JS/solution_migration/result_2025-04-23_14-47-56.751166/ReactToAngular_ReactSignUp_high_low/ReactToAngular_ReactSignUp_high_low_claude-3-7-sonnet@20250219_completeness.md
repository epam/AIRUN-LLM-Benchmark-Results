# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the signup component includes all three required form fields: name, email, and password

    The answer includes these three form fields in the HTML template:
    ```html
    <form-input type="text" name="name" value={name} ... />
    <form-input type="email" name="email" value={email} ... />
    <form-input type="password" name="password" value={password} ... />
    ```
    
    I'm not 100% confident because while the fields are present, they're using a custom `form-input` component rather than standard Angular form controls, which might not be the correct implementation.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page includes a heading 'Join PodBaby today.'

    The provided HTML template doesn't include any heading with the text 'Join PodBaby today.' This element is completely missing from the code.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the page includes a lead paragraph about membership benefits

    There is no paragraph about membership benefits in the provided HTML template. This requirement is not met at all.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form includes a submit button with appropriate styling and icon

    The form includes a submit button:
    ```html
    <button type="submit" class="form-control">Submit</button>
    ```
    It has styling with the "form-control" class, although it doesn't show an icon implementation.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the page includes a link to the login page with appropriate text

    There is no link to the login page in the provided HTML template. This requirement is not met.

- **Pass** (80%): Ensure the FormGroup component or equivalent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display

    The code shows FormGroup being used:
    ```html
    <form [formGroup]="form">
    ```
    and referenced in the component:
    ```typescript
    constructor(private form: FormGroup, private formInput: FormInput) {}
    ```
    However, I'm not fully confident because the implementation seems incomplete and doesn't specifically demonstrate error display functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the Icon component or equivalent is implemented for the signup button

    The submit button shown in the HTML doesn't include any icon implementation:
    ```html
    <button type="submit" class="form-control">Submit</button>
    ```
    The requirement for an icon is not met.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm all validation rules are implemented (name length, email format, password length)

    While the answer mentions validation in general terms, it doesn't include specific validation rules for name length, email format, or password length. The code snippets don't show these validation rules being implemented.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure asynchronous validation for both name and email uniqueness is implemented

    The answer mentions `asyncValidate` and checking email and name, but doesn't provide the actual implementation of these checks:
    ```
    The `asyncValidate` function will be modified to use the `Promise.all` method.
    It will call the `checkEmail` and `checkName` functions to validate the data.
    ```
    The code snippets don't show this implementation.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the signup API integration is complete with proper error handling

    While the answer mentions API integration and error handling conceptually, the actual implementation is not shown in the code snippets. There's no concrete API call or error handling implementation visible.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the form layout matches the horizontal form structure specified

    There's no indication in the HTML template that a horizontal form structure is being used. The form appears to be a standard vertical form without any layout specifications for horizontal structure.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page has proper document title setting functionality

    There is no code related to setting the document title in the provided snippets. This requirement is not met.
