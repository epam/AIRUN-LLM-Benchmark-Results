# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (80%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The component imports and uses FormGroup from Angular forms. However, the provided snippet does not show a full reactive form setup (e.g., using FormBuilder or detailed form control initialization), which introduces some uncertainty. That is why confidence is 80%.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  There is no evidence in the provided code snippet that any synchronous validations for field lengths or formats are implemented.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  The answer does not present any asynchronous validation logic to check if the name or email is already in use.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  While the answer mentions using properties like hasFeedback, there is no concrete implementation shown for displaying error or success styling on form fields after user interactions.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  The handleSubmit function is merely a stub with a comment (“// ...”) and does not demonstrate an API call or dispatch of actions.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  There is no implementation provided in the answer that shows error messages being rendered underneath form fields upon validation failures.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  The Angular Title service is not mentioned or used anywhere in the answer.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The answer does not reference @ngrx/store or @ngrx/effects, even though state management via Redux-related patterns is alluded to, there is no implementation detail confirming their usage.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  There is no indication or logic provided in the answer that disables the submit button during an ongoing submission.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  The API call handling is not implemented or shown, lacking any evidence of managing different responses.

- **Pass** (70%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component uses the Angular component decorator and standard structure with template, stylesheet, and dependency injection. However, some practices (e.g., detailed reactive form setup and proper separation of concerns) seem only partially addressed. This partial implementation brings the confidence down to 70%.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  There is no usage of Angular's HttpClient in the provided code, and no promise-based logic appears to be replaced with Observables.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  There is no implementation that ties the error messages to the input fields per the requirements.
