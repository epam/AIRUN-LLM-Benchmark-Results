# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The provided answer discusses migrating to Angular 14, but it doesn't contain any actual Angular 14.x implementation code. It only provides a plan and strategy for the migration, not an actual migrated application.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
  
  The answer mentions NgRx as a recommendation for state management but doesn't include any implementation of @ngrx/store. There is no code showing actions, reducers, or store configuration.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
  
  There is no implementation of @ngrx/effects in the provided answer. The answer only suggests NgRx as a state management solution without showing any effects implementation.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
  
  No NgRx actions, reducers, or selectors are implemented in the answer. The answer only mentions NgRx conceptually without providing any implementation code.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
  
  The answer doesn't contain any Angular component implementations with decorators. It only discusses the need to migrate React components to Angular components without showing actual code with @Component, @Input, or @Output decorators.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators
  
  The answer doesn't show any implementation of @ViewChild decorators to replace React refs. It only mentions that React components need to be migrated to Angular.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
  
  The answer discusses the need to convert React event handlers to Angular's event binding system but doesn't show any implementation using @Input() or @Output() EventEmitter.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
  
  While the answer mentions the need for Angular services, it doesn't provide any service implementations. There is no code showing how services would be created or used.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
  
  The answer mentions dependency injection as an architectural consideration but doesn't show any implementation of Angular's dependency injection system.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
  
  The answer briefly mentions using ChangeDetectorRef for performance optimization but doesn't show any implementation of change detection strategies.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
  
  The answer discusses the need to create an Angular Router instance but doesn't show any implementation of the Router configuration or usage.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The answer doesn't contain any Angular implementation to evaluate against style guide conventions.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
  
  The answer doesn't contain any TypeScript interfaces or types implementation.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
  
  The answer discusses the need to convert React JSX to Angular templates but doesn't provide any actual converted templates.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
  
  The answer mentions that React event handlers need to be translated to Angular event bindings but doesn't show any implementation examples.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs
  
  There is no code provided to evaluate for TODOs.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules
  
  The answer doesn't mention lazy loading for feature modules, nor does it provide any implementation of lazy loading.
