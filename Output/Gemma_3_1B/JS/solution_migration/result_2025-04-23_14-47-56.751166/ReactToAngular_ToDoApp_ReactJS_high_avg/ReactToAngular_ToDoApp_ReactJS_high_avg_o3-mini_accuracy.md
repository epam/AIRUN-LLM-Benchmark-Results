# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The migration plan clearly states it is targeting Angular 14.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The plan mentions using NgRx and even assumes its usage; however, it does not explicitly detail @ngrx/store. I’m fairly confident (95%) that this aspect is intended.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  There is no mention of @ngrx/effects or handling side effects explicitly in the migration plan.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  The answer discusses NgRx usage but does not cover the implementation details of actions, reducers, or selectors.

- **Fail** (80%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  While the answer outlines component migration, it does not specifically state that Angular decorators like @Component, @Input, or @Output will be used. I am 80% confident in marking this as a fail due to the lack of explicit mention.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  There is no discussion of React refs or their Angular replacements in the provided plan.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  The plan refers to translating event handlers and data bindings to Angular but does not explicitly state the usage of @Input() and @Output(), so I mark this as a fail with 90% confidence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  The migration plan includes creating Angular services to encapsulate business logic, ensuring a proper structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  The plan emphasizes Angular’s dependency injection system as essential for testability and maintainability.

- **Fail** (80%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  There is no explicit mention or plan for applying Angular’s change detection strategies, though the general emphasis on Angular’s best practices is noted. I mark this as a fail with 80% confidence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  The plan clearly states that an Angular Router instance will be created and configured for navigation.

- **Fail** (80%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The answer does not mention adherence to Angular style guide conventions. I am 80% confident that this requirement is not explicitly addressed.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  There is only a brief reference to converting constants to an enum. No mention is made of maintaining interfaces and types throughout the codebase.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  The plan consistently states that React elements and JSX will be replaced by Angular equivalents, implying conversion to HTML templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  The migration steps cover replacing React event handlers (like onToggle, onDestroy, and handleChange) with Angular event binding techniques.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  The provided migration plan does not include any TODO comments.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  There is no indication that the plan addresses or implements lazy loading for feature modules.
