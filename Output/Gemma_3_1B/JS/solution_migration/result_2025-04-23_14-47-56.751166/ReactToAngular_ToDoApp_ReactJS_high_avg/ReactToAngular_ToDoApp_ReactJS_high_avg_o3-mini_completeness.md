# Evaluation Report

Below is a step‐by‐step evaluation based on the provided evaluation steps:

1. **Fail** (90%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
   The answer discusses variables like “allTodo”, “activeTodo”, and “completedTodo” and mentions converting them to Angular components. However, it does not explicitly ensure that the display logic (i.e. rendering all todo items in the UI) is implemented in the migration plan.

2. **Fail** (90%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
   While the answer mentions replacing the React input element with an Angular form element, it does not detail how new todo items will be added. There is no clear plan addressing the complete add-item functionality.

3. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
   The plan explicitly addresses converting the “onToggle” event handler from React to an Angular event binding. This indicates that the toggling mechanism is being considered in the migration.

4. **Pass** (90%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
   The answer indicates that the “edit” method in the todo item component should be translated into an appropriate Angular event handler (e.g. using Angular’s OnChange mechanism). Though brief, it shows that editing is on the migration agenda.

5. **Pass** (80%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
   The reference to translating the “onDestroy” event handler suggests that deletion or cleanup is being handled. However, it is not 100% clear if this fully covers the expected “delete” functionality, so some uncertainty remains.

6. **Fail** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
   The provided migration plan does not mention any mechanism to “Mark all as complete” even though this is a typical feature in a todo list application.

7. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
   The plan explicitly covers the configuration of the Angular router to manage routes for “/”, “/active”, and “/completed” which indicates that filtering through URL-based states is considered.

8. **Fail** (90%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
   Although the plan calls for the creation of a footer component populated with data from the TodoApp, it does not specifically mention displaying a count of active todo items.

9. **Fail** (90%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
   The answer notes that the React “clearButton” should be replaced by an Angular Button element, but it does not elaborate on ensuring that clicking this button will actually remove the completed items.

10. **Fail** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
    There is no mention of implementing persistence via local storage or any alternative persistence mechanism in the migration plan.

11. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
    The plan clearly identifies the need to create and configure the Angular router for the same URL paths (including “/”, “/active”, “/completed”, and “/enter”), which strongly indicates that URL structure preservation is intended.

12. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
    There is no discussion about handling or designing for empty states (e.g. when no todo items exist) in the migration plan.

13. **Fail** (90%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
    While the plan indicates replacing the React form elements with Angular counterparts (for input, button, etc.), it does not provide details on handling form submissions and validating the submitted data.

14. **Fail** (90%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
    The migration plan lays out a high-level strategy for converting components and managing state via NgRx, but it does not explicitly address preserving the exact component structure and relationships from the original React application.

15. **Fail** (80%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
    The answer refers to transferring and carefully analyzing event handlers (e.g. shouldComponentUpdate) and mapping business logic to Angular patterns. However, there is no comprehensive plan detailing how the entire business logic is verified to be preserved in the migration.
