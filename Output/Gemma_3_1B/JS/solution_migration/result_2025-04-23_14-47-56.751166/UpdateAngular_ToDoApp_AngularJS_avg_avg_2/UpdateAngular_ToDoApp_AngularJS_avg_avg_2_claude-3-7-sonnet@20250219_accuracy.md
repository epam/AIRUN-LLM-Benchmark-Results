# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The answer discusses migrating to Angular 14.x as a recommendation, but doesn't provide actual implementation code that confirms Angular 14.x is being used. It only offers migration guidance rather than showing implemented code with Angular 14.x imports, decorators, or configuration.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS
  
  The answer mentions the need to replace RequireJS with ES modules but doesn't show any actual implementation of ES modules. No import/export statements or module bundler configuration is provided.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management
  
  While NgRx is mentioned as a recommendation for state management, there is no actual implementation code showing @ngrx/store imports, store configuration, or store usage in components.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects
  
  There is no implementation of @ngrx/effects shown in the code. The answer only mentions NgRx conceptually without providing any effects implementation.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management
  
  No specific actions, reducers, selectors, or effects are defined in the code. These NgRx concepts are only mentioned as possibilities without implementation details.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator
  
  No actual service implementation with @Injectable decorator is provided. The answer only discusses converting services conceptually.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service
  
  The answer mentions using localStorage for simple persistence but doesn't provide any implementation code showing how localStorage is integrated into an Angular service.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators
  
  No actual component implementation with @Component decorators is provided. The answer only discusses component conversion conceptually.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators
  
  No directive implementation with @Directive decorators is provided. The answer only mentions converting directives conceptually.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)
  
  No component templates with Angular syntax are provided. The answer doesn't show any actual template implementation.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))
  
  No event binding implementation is shown in the code. The answer mentions converting ng-click to standard Angular events but doesn't show the actual implementation.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])
  
  No property binding implementation is shown in the code. The answer doesn't include any examples of Angular property binding syntax.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed
  
  While lifecycle hooks like ngOnInit, ngOnChanges, and ngOnDestroy are mentioned, no actual implementation of these hooks is provided in the code.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models
  
  No TypeScript interfaces or classes for data models are provided in the code. The answer mentions using TypeScript but doesn't show any type definitions.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services
  
  No actual implementation of dependency injection is shown in the code. The answer mentions implementing Angular's dependency injection system but doesn't show how.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  Since no actual code implementation is provided, it's impossible to verify if Angular style guide conventions are followed.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings
  
  Since no actual implementation is provided, it's impossible to verify if there are no console errors or warnings.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)
  
  No TypeScript implementation is shown in the code. The answer mentions using TypeScript but doesn't demonstrate any actual TypeScript features.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code
  
  Since no actual code implementation is provided, it's impossible to verify if there are TODOs or commented-out code.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design
  
  Since no actual component implementation is provided, it's impossible to verify if the single responsibility principle is followed in component design.
