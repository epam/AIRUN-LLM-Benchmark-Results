# Evaluation Report

Below is the evaluation for each step with the corresponding confidence levels:

1. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
   The answer explicitly states “Angular 14.x” and outlines migration considerations specific to this version.

2. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
   The plan clearly includes the removal of RequireJS and replacing it with ES modules (and optionally a bundler).

3. **Fail** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
   Although the answer suggests considering NgRx as one option, it does not confirm that @ngrx/store is implemented.

4. **Fail** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
   There is no mention or confirmation that NgRx effects are implemented for handling side effects.

5. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
   The answer provides migration steps but does not list or confirm that these specific NgRx artifacts are set up.

6. **Fail** (90%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
   The migration plan indicates converting components and services but does not explicitly mention the use of the @Injectable decorator. (Confidence is 90% because while modern Angular practices imply this, the answer does not state it explicitly.)

7. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
   The answer clearly discusses using localStorage for simple persistence.

8. **Pass** (90%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
   The plan calls for converting AngularJS controllers to Angular components, which implies the use of @Component decorators; however, the answer does not provide code examples. (Slight reduction in confidence due to lack of explicit code.)

9. **Pass** (90%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
   The answer mentions converting directives to Angular directives. While it does not explicitly reference the @Directive decorator, it is implied in the migration process.

10. **Pass** (90%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
    The migration steps refer to converting AngularJS constructs into Angular’s templating syntax. Although specific examples like *ngFor or *ngIf are not explicitly stated, it is implied by the conversion process.

11. **Pass** (90%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
    The answer explains converting legacy AngularJS directives such as ng-click to Angular’s standard event binding syntax. This conversion is suggested even if no code snippet is provided.

12. **Pass** (90%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
    While not explicitly detailed, the overall conversion approach implies adopting Angular’s property binding syntax.

13. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
    The answer explicitly mentions the use of lifecycle hooks (ngOnInit, ngOnChanges, ngOnDestroy) as part of the migration.

14. **Fail** (90%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
    Although the answer mentions “Use TypeScript to improve code quality,” it does not specifically confirm the use of TypeScript interfaces/classes for modeling data. (The lack of explicit mention leads to a slightly lower confidence.)

15. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
    The migration steps include "Implement Angular's dependency injection system," which supports this requirement.

16. **Pass** (80%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
    The answer suggests following best practices and Angular conventions, but it does not explicitly detail adherence to the Angular style guide. (A small reduction in confidence due to the absence of direct code examples.)

17. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
    Since the answer is a migration plan rather than executed code, there is no evidence that the application is error/warning free.

18. **Fail** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
    The migration plan recommends the use of TypeScript; however, it does not confirm that modern TypeScript features (such as strict typing via interfaces) are correctly implemented.

19. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
    The provided answer does not include any TODOs or commented-out sections.

20. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design  
    The breakdown of the migration phases indicates a separation of concerns (e.g., dedicated components for form, list, and service), which aligns with the single responsibility principle.
