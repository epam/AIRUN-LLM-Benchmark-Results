# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list  
  The answer explicitly instructs to convert "todoList" into an Angular ListComponent or view.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos  
  The answer describes converting "todoForm" into an Angular form, which handles adding new todos.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos  
  The plan mentions converting the "edit" part to an Angular Input with ngModel and also addresses component conversion for editing, though it does not clearly separate an "editing" component. The intent is clear but details could be more explicit.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos  
  The migration plan outlines converting "statusFilter" and AngularJS filter directives into Angular constructs, addressing filtering of the todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics  
  The answer includes converting "remainingCount" and "doneCount" into Angular properties, which handle todo count statistics.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos  
  The conversion of the "todoForm" indicates that adding new todos is part of the migration strategy.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos  
  The migration plan covers editing by converting the "edit" functionality to use Angular’s binding (ngModel) and component lifecycle hooks.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos  
  The provided plan includes converting the "remove" functionality into an Angular button event, which implies the delete functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed  
  The answer notes a conversion for "toggle" that would handle marking todos as completed via Angular’s binding and event system.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)  
  The migration steps explicitly describe converting filtering mechanisms (e.g., "statusFilter") to handle different states of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete  
  The answer mentions converting "allChecked" into an Angular checkbox with appropriate event handling.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos  
  The migration plan does not mention any specific functionality for clearing completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos  
  The plan includes converting "remainingCount" to an Angular property, which serves this purpose.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage  
  The discussion on state management and data persistence clearly indicates using localStorage for persistence.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization  
  Although the answer implies persistence via an Angular service (“todoStorage”), it does not explicitly state that persisted todos are loaded on initialization. The intent is inferred, but the explicit loading step is not described in detail.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing  
  There is no mention of handling the escape key input to cancel editing in the migration plan.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo  
  The answer does not address the behavior for automatically focusing the input field during editing.

  The migration plan does not describe measures to ensure that the visual appearance remains unchanged.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately  
  There is no discussion on handling cases when the todo titles are empty.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter  
  The plan does not mention any strategy or implementation details concerning URL updates based on filter changes.
