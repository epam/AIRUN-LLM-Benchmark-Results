# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration
  
  While the answer mentions using React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript, the implementation details show significant issues. The code uses a mix of React components with TypeScript and direct DOM manipulation (like `document.querySelector`). This approach is incompatible with React's declarative paradigm and shows the solution is not properly implementing a React 18 application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure
  
  The solution correctly defines a TypeScript interface for the sound mapping structure in `AppProps`:
  ```typescript
  interface AppProps {
    soundMapper: {
      c: string;
      d: string;
      e: string;
      // other notes defined...
    };
  }
  ```

- **Fail** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks
  
  While some components are defined as functional components with the React.FC type, the implementation is incomplete and inconsistent. The Play component contains JSX without a wrapping element or fragment and incorrectly attempts to use the setPlayed function that isn't defined in its scope.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)
  
  The solution shows incomplete state management. While it uses useState for 'played' in the App component, it later directly mutates the played array in the play function rather than using the setPlayed function. The code also mixes React state with direct DOM manipulation, which violates React's principles.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels
  
  The solution doesn't implement keyboard event handlers using React patterns. Instead, it uses direct DOM event listeners like `document.addEventListener` which is not the React way of handling events. Proper React keyboard event handling should use onKeyDown/onKeyUp with useEffect.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events
  
  The solution uses direct DOM event listeners for mouse interactions:
  ```javascript
  piano.addEventListener('mousedown', play)
  piano.addEventListener('mouseup', resetActive)
  piano.addEventListener('mouseout', resetActive)
  piano.addEventListener('mousemove', play)
  ```
  This approach is incompatible with React. It should use React's synthetic events like onMouseDown, onMouseUp, etc.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment
  
  The solution doesn't properly demonstrate how audio resources are handled in React. It assumes a soundMapper object that contains audio elements, but doesn't show how these would be created or managed within React's lifecycle.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility
  
  The fullscreen functionality is implemented using direct DOM manipulation and event listeners, not React patterns:
  ```javascript
  const fullscreenButton = document.querySelector('.fullscreen');
  fullscreenButton.addEventListener('click', fullscreen);
  ```
  It should be implemented with React's onClick handlers and useEffect if needed.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns
  
  The solution uses direct DOM manipulation to add and remove classes:
  ```javascript
  pianoEl.classList.add('piano-key-active');
  pianoEl.classList.remove('piano-key-active');
  ```
  This should be implemented using React's conditional className or the className package.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate
  
  There's no evidence of any performance optimizations like React.memo, useMemo, or useCallback in the provided solution.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations
  
  The solution doesn't address how to handle audio playback within React's lifecycle. It directly manipulates audio elements:
  ```javascript
  sound.currentTime = 0;
  sound.play();
  ```
  without considering how to handle cleanup or prevent memory leaks.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application
  
  While some TypeScript is used, there are many instances where types are missing or incomplete:
  - The play function lacks parameter typing: `function play(event)`
  - The event types aren't properly narrowed: `event instanceof KeyboardEvent`
  - The event's key property is accessed without type checking: `event.key.toUpperCase()`
