# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (95%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'
  
  The provided code does not include a header component or any element with the title 'Virtual Piano'. The main App component doesn't render any header element, and there's no implementation of a header in any of the provided components.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons
  
  While the code includes Button components and references to 'Letters' and 'Notes' buttons, they are implemented incorrectly. The App component renders them directly without a container, and the Button component implementation is flawed with a conditional that doesn't match its usage.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)
  
  Although PianoKey components are referenced in the App component, they are not properly wrapped in a container and the syntax for rendering multiple components is incorrect (missing React.Fragment or enclosing div). Additionally, the Piano component referenced in imports is not properly defined or used.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes
  
  While the PianoKey component accepts dataLetter and dataNote props, in the App component they are incorrectly passed as HTML attributes (data-letter, data-note) instead of as React props. This is a fundamental React syntax error.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked
  
  The audio playing functionality is implemented using direct DOM manipulation (document.querySelector) rather than React's event system. Additionally, the soundMapper referenced in the play function is defined in the App props but not actually used correctly in the implementation.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)
  
  The code attempts to manage active states by directly manipulating DOM elements with classList.add('piano-key-active'), which is not the React way. It should use state or CSS-in-JS to manage active states.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes
  
  While there's keyboard event handling code (checking for event instanceof KeyboardEvent), there are no actual event listeners attached for keyboard events in a React-appropriate way (e.g., using useEffect).

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked
  
  The button click handlers are implemented incorrectly. They update a 'played' state with string values like 'Notes' and 'Key' rather than toggling a display mode state that would control what's shown on the piano keys.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes
  
  The fullscreen functionality uses direct DOM manipulation and attaches event listeners directly to DOM elements, which is inappropriate in React. There's no fullscreen button rendered in the JSX of any component.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly
  
  The provided implementation doesn't have proper state management for tracking multiple simultaneous key presses. The direct DOM manipulations and the way the 'played' array is handled would not support this requirement correctly.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys
  
  While there's a reference to mouse events (mousemove, mousedown, etc.), they're added using addEventListener on DOM elements rather than as React event handlers. The implementation is incompatible with React's declarative event handling approach.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information
  
  The provided code doesn't include any footer component or element containing year information.
