# Evaluation Report

Below is the evaluation of each step with our confidence levels:

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'  
  The provided code does not include any header or element rendering the text “Virtual Piano.”

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons  
  While there are Button components for “Letters” and “Notes”, there is no explicit container (such as an element with a class like “btn-container”) clearly wrapping these buttons in the JSX output.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)  
  The App component instantiates multiple PianoKey elements corresponding to both natural notes (c, d, e, f, g, a, b) and sharp notes (c♯, d♯, f♯, g♯, a♯). The keys cover the provided sound mapper keys.  
  (Confidence less than 100% because while the code lists them, integration and visual arrangement are not fully detailed.)

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes  
  The PianoKey component is defined to receive props as camelCase (dataLetter, dataNote), yet the usage in the App component uses attribute names like data-letter and data-note. This mismatch might lead to issues in passing the props as intended.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked  
  Although a play function is provided that references soundMapper and attempts to play audio tied to the note, the integration between the React components and the DOM-manipulated event listeners isn’t fully clear. There is no demonstration of actual audio files being triggered in a React-consistent manner.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)  
  The play and resetActive functions add and remove a "piano-key-active" class on piano keys. However, because this is handled via DOM manipulation outside typical React state management, its robustness is uncertain though the basic functionality appears to be implemented.

- **Fail** (95%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes  
  The play function includes a check for KeyboardEvent and attempts to select an element based on the event key. However, there is no evidence in the provided code of global event listeners (e.g., for keydown) being attached properly to capture keyboard events.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked  
  While there are buttons labeled “Letters” and “Notes,” the onClick handlers merely push an item into the played array. There is no logic that actually toggles the display between notes and letters.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes  
  A fullscreen function is defined and a querySelector is used to attach its click event to an element with the class “fullscreen.” Although no JSX for this button is shown, the provided logic is correct for toggling fullscreen.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly  
  There is no explicit mechanism or logic ensuring that multiple keys can be pressed and processed simultaneously; the use of a single “played” array and direct DOM event handling does not clearly address simultaneous interactions.

- **Fail** (80%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys  
  While there is an event listener for mousemove on the piano element that calls play, the implementation details for a proper drag (with continuous press and movement across keys) are not clearly established, making this functionality uncertain.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information  
  No footer element or any reference to year information is present in the provided code.
