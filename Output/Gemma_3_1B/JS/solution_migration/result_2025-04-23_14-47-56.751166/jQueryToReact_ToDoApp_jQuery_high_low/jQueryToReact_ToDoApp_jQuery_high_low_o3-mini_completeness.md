# Evaluation Report

Below is the step-by-step evaluation of the answer provided against the specified functionality requirements:

1. **Fail** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos  
   The answer does not mention implementing any header component with a title or an input field for new todo creation.

2. **Pass** (90%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos  
   The answer does mention a “toggleAll” function and outlines a component structure that includes a TodoList. Although it does not explicitly refer to a “main section,” the inclusion of these elements implies the intended functionality. Nonetheless, the lack of explicit detail warrants a slight reduction in confidence.

3. **Pass** (90%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button  
   The answer outlines components such as TodoItem, Toggle, and mentions a "destroy" functionality via destroyCompleted. While it talks about a toggle and deletion mechanism indirectly, the explicit inclusion of a title display and a dedicated delete button is not detailed. The core functionality is implied, so it passes with high confidence.

4. **Fail** (90%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode  
   The answer references an edit function and its migration to React’s state management but does not explicitly mention that the editing mode is triggered by a double-click on the todo label.

5. **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
   While the answer discusses the overall migration plan and component breakdown, it does not explicitly describe the implementation of filtering functionality to separate todos into All, Active, and Completed categories.

6. **Fail** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization  
   There is no mention of displaying the count of remaining todos or handling proper pluralization in the answer.

7. **Fail** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter  
   The answer briefly notes a Footer component but does not detail the inclusion of filter links or any mechanism for highlighting the current selection.

8. **Fail** (90%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist  
   Although the answer mentions a destroyCompleted function, it does not provide explicit detail on a “Clear completed” button in the footer.

9. **Fail** (90%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter  
   The answer does not provide information regarding the user interaction for creating a todo (such as handling the Enter key event).

10. **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos  
    The answer includes reference to a Toggle component and explains that React’s event handling will manage the completion status of individual todos.

11. **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once  
    The answer explicitly discusses a toggleAll function that indicates the application intends to support toggling all todos simultaneously.

12. **Fail** (70%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management  
    Although an edit function is mentioned, the answer does not explicitly detail handling focus management when switching to editing mode. This creates uncertainty over the proper user experience.

13. **Fail** (90%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos  
    While a delete functionality is implied via the “destroy” or “destroyCompleted” functions, there is no explicit mention of deleting an individual todo item.

14. **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos  
    The answer clearly refers to the destroyCompleted function, indicating that clearing completed todos is a planned functionality.

15. **Fail** (80%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status  
    There is only an indirect mention of filtering in relation to the Footer and component structure. No detailed approach for filtering is provided, lowering confidence in this requirement being fully met.
