# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist

    The answer does not provide actual test examples for basic component rendering with default props. While it mentions the concept of component rendering tests in section A.3 "Component.test.js", the example provided is generic and doesn't specifically test rendering with default props. It only shows a simple component that receives a "data" prop, which doesn't address testing default props.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present

    The answer mentions that events like `onKeyDown` are critical and need to be tested, but it doesn't provide any specific test examples for keyboard navigation. There are no test examples showing how to test arrow keys, tab, enter, or escape functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)

    While the answer mentions events like `onMouseMove`, `onMouseOver`, and `onMouseExit`, it doesn't provide specific test examples for these mouse interactions. The examples given do not demonstrate how to test clicking or hovering behaviors.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior

    The answer does not specifically address testing controlled versus uncontrolled component behavior. No distinction is made between these two patterns in the proposed test strategy, and no examples are provided to test either approach.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values

    While the answer mentions `onSelect` and `onClear` events, it doesn't include specific test examples for state changes that occur when selecting, removing, or clearing values. The examples provided don't demonstrate how to test these interactions and their resulting state changes.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented

    The answer doesn't provide specific test examples for menu opening and closing behavior. Though it references `MenuPlacement` and `MenuPosition` tests, these focus on prop validation rather than the behavior of opening and closing the menu.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality

    The answer doesn't include any specific test examples for option filtering or searching functionality. This important feature of select components is not addressed in the testing strategy.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist

    The answer does not provide any specific test examples for multi-select behavior, which is a key feature of many select components.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility

    While the answer mentions that ARIA attributes are important for accessibility and need to be tested, it doesn't provide any specific test examples showing how to verify ARIA attributes or screen reader compatibility.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested

    The answer doesn't provide any test examples for edge cases such as empty options. These important scenarios are not specifically addressed in the testing strategy.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states

    The answer doesn't include any specific test examples for loading or error states. These important UI states are not addressed in the testing plan.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states

    The answer mentions `isOptionDisabled` as a custom property that needs testing, but it doesn't provide any specific test examples showing how to verify disabled options or states.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance

    The answer doesn't include any specific test examples or strategies for testing large option sets to verify performance. This performance consideration is not addressed.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested

    While the answer mentions that focus and focusable properties are key and need verification, it doesn't provide specific test examples showing how to test focus management during interactions.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering

    The answer doesn't include any specific test examples for verifying placeholder and value rendering, which are important aspects of select components.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations

    While the answer mentions `formatGroupLabel` as a custom property that needs testing, it doesn't provide specific test examples for testing custom formatOptionLabel implementations.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)

    The answer includes a brief example for testing `onInputChange`, but it lacks comprehensive examples for testing other important callbacks like onChange, onMenuOpen, and onMenuClose. The example provided is very basic and doesn't demonstrate proper validation of the callback's behavior.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)

    The answer doesn't include any specific test examples for indicator components such as dropdown indicators, clear indicators, or loading indicators.
