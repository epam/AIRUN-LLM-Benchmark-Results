# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist  
  Although the "Component.test.js" example shows rendering a component with provided props, there is no explicit demonstration of tests verifying default props. However, the basic rendering test gives some confidence that rendering is covered. This results in a pass with slight reservation.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present  
  The answer does not include any specific tests or examples addressing keyboard interactions such as arrow keys, tab, enter, or escape.

- **Fail** (90%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)  
  While the E2E section mentions simulating user actions and clicking, there are no concrete test examples specifically targeting mouse events like hovering or clicking that verify the expected behavior.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior  
  The provided answer does not address or differentiate tests for controlled vs. uncontrolled component states.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values  
  There is no evidence of tests that explicitly verify state transitions upon selecting, removing, or clearing values.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented  
  Although the examples mention integration tests related to menu properties (placement and position), there is no explicit test for menu open/close interactions.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality  
  The answer does not include any tests for filtering options or for search behavior within the component.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist  
  There is no test or example addressing scenarios specific to multi-select behavior.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility  
  While ARIA attributes are discussed in the strategy section, there are no concrete test examples that verify their presence or correct functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested  
  The answer does not provide any tests that handle scenarios with empty option sets.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states  
  There is no mention or example test that covers loading states or error handling cases.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states  
  The response does not include any tests specifically verifying disabled options or states.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance  
  There is no testing strategy or example provided that targets performance or behavior when handling large option sets.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested  
  Although focus management is noted as a requirement in the discussion, there are no explicit tests demonstrating how focus is managed during user interactions.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering  
  The answer does not demonstrate any testing for verifying correct rendering of placeholders or values.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations  
  While custom properties are mentioned (such as formatGroupLabel), there is no test provided for custom formatOptionLabel functionalities.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)  
  The provided examples include an onInputChange test but omit tests for onChange, onMenuOpen, and onMenuClose, falling short of full callback coverage.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)  
  The answer does not include tests or examples for indicator components like dropdown, clear, or loading indicators.
