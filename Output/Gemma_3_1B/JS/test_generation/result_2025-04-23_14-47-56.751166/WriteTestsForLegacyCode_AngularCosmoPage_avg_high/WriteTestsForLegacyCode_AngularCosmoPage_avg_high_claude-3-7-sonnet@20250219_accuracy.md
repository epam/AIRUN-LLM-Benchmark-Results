# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)

    The answer discusses using Jest as a recommended testing framework, but doesn't provide actual test implementation using any framework. It only suggests: "I recommend **Jest** for its ease of use, excellent mocking capabilities, and strong test runner."

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints

    The answer mentions that mocking the REST factory's responses is essential, stating: "you need to mock the `REST` factory's responses," but doesn't provide any actual implementation of mocks for $resource or REST API endpoints.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation

    The answer doesn't include any test implementation with beforeEach/afterEach hooks for setup and teardown.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls

    While the answer recommends mocking ("Use a mocking library like `jest.mock` or a dedicated mocking library like `sinon`"), it doesn't contain actual mock implementations for HTTP requests.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection

    The answer doesn't include any code showing dependency injection patterns or AngularJS-specific testing approaches.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations

    The answer mentions testing asynchronous operations in general terms ("If your application uses asynchronous operations (e.g., API calls), test how these operations are handled") but doesn't provide any example of handling promises or async operations in tests.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies

    While mocking is mentioned as important, no actual implementation of spies or mocks is provided in the answer.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization

    No actual test structure using describe/it pattern is shown in the answer.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls

    The answer suggests testing both positive and negative scenarios for various resources (e.g., "Positive: Create a blocks resource..." and "Negative: Attempt to create a blocks resource with an invalid blockID"), but doesn't actually implement these tests. However, the answer does show understanding of testing both success and error paths.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate

    The answer doesn't include any examples of simulating user interactions in tests.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage

    The answer doesn't address cleanup after test execution to prevent state leakage.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested

    The answer suggests descriptive test scenarios that clearly explain what is being tested (e.g., "Create a blocks resource with blockID = '123'..."). While not implemented as actual test names, the suggested test cases do follow good naming/description practices.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible

    The answer doesn't provide examples showing how to validate function outputs rather than implementation details.
