# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation includes a comprehensive component overview explaining the purpose and architecture
  
  The documentation provides a clear overview in Section 1 "Component Overview" that explains the purpose of the page management components within the "cosmo" application, outlines the architecture involving the REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and pageCtrl controller, and explains how they interact with the backend API.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all major components (REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and Page controller) are documented
  
  All major components are thoroughly documented in Section 2 "Component Features" with dedicated subsections (2.1-2.4) for each component, including their purpose, implementation details, and dependencies.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure all significant features of the page management system are described
  
  The documentation covers all significant features including CRUD operations, version control, scheduling, content editing, tag management, and extras management, primarily in Section 2 "Component Features" and expanded upon in Section 3 "Interface Specifications."

- **Pass** (90%): Check that all form inputs and their behavior are documented
  
  The documentation details most form inputs and their behavior through the interface specifications in Section 3, particularly in the Page Factory parameters table and pageCtrl Controller sections. However, there could be more detail about specific form validation rules and edge cases.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the documentation explains the page versioning and revision system
  
  The versioning system is explained in Section 2.4 under "Version Control" where it mentions using localStorage to detect and handle unsaved changes, and provides functionality to revert to previously saved versions. Section 3.3 also lists the `$scope.localVersion()` and `$scope.deleteNewerVersion()` functions. However, it could provide more details about how versions are stored and compared.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation covers the tag system and autocomplete functionality
  
  The tag system and autocomplete functionality are covered in Section 2.4 under "Tag Management" and in Section 3.3 which details the `$scope.autocompleteTags()` and `$scope.selectSuggestion(tag)` functions.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure the documentation includes explanation of error handling and user notifications
  
  The documentation does not provide specific details about error handling mechanisms or how users are notified of successes, failures, or other system events. While the documentation is comprehensive in many areas, this important aspect of user experience and system reliability is missing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page publishing workflow including scheduling
  
  The publishing workflow is explained in Section 2.4 under "Scheduling" which describes the ability to schedule pages for future publication. The Page Factory in Section 3.2 also includes parameters for `published` status and `published_date`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation details how content extras and additional metadata are managed
  
  The documentation addresses extras management in Section 2.4 under "Extras Management" and includes the `extras` and `misc` parameters in the Page Factory specifications in Section 3.2.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation explains how the UI interacts with the backend APIs
  
  The documentation clearly explains how the UI interacts with backend APIs, primarily through the REST factory which is detailed in Section 2.1 and Section 3.1. It explains how the factory leverages Angular's $resource service for HTTP requests and how each API endpoint is configured.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes sample usage examples or patterns
  
  Section 4 "Usage Documentation" provides usage examples including initialization, common use cases, and a specific code example for saving a page in Section 4.3.

- **Fail** (80%): Verify the documentation explains all significant event broadcasting and inter-component communication
  
  While the documentation mentions that components work in conjunction and that the Page factory allows for data sharing, it lacks specific details about event broadcasting mechanisms and comprehensive inter-component communication patterns. There's no clear explanation of how events are propagated between components or how the $rootScope (which is listed as a dependency) is used for communication.
