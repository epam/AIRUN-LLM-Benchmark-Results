# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The application correctly fetches characters from the SWAPI API using axios in the useEffect hook and displays them in an unordered list.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The application includes a loading state that displays "Loading characters..." while fetching data from the API.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The code maps through all characters in the response data and renders each one as a list item.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  There are no search inputs or filtering mechanisms implemented in the provided code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character's name is displayed inside a list item with proper formatting.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The code includes setup instructions using Create React App with TypeScript template and the package.json structure is consistent with CRA projects.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The application uses useState hooks to manage three states: characters, loading, and error, and properly updates them during the API call lifecycle.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each list item has a unique key using the character's URL property: `<li key={character.url}>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  The application handles three possible states: loading, error, and successful data fetching. If there's an error, it displays the error message. If the data is loading, it shows a loading message. If the data is fetched successfully, it displays the list of characters.
