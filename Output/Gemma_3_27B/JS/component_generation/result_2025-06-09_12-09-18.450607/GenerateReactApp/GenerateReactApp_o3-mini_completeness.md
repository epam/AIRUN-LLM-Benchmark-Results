# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The code fetches the characters from the API and renders them in a list using the .map() function.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  A loading indicator is provided via the conditional rendering of the "Loading characters..." message when the loading state is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  The fetched data is stored in the state and then mapped to display each character's name in the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  There is no implementation of search or user input fields, adhering to the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each list item renders the character's name, and the key property is set to character.url for each item.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The provided instructions and package.json indicate that the project uses Create React App with the TypeScript template.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The code uses React's useState hook to manage loading, error, and character states appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  The code uses character.url as a unique key for each list item, ensuring optimal rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  In the scenario where the API returns an empty list, the code will render an empty list which is acceptable. Additionally, proper loading and error states ensure that even an empty array is handled gracefully.
