# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The application uses axios to fetch character data from the SWAPI API (`https://swapi.dev/api/people`) and maps through the results to display each character's name in a list.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The application has a loading state initialized as `true` that displays "Loading characters..." while the API call is in progress. After the data is fetched or an error occurs, the loading state is set to `false`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The application maps through all characters in the `characters` state array (which is populated with all results from the API response) and renders each one in a list item.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  The code provided does not include any search functionality, search input fields, or any other user input components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character is displayed in a list item (`<li>`) showing its name property: `{character.name}`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The setup instructions explicitly use Create React App with TypeScript template: `npx create-react-app swapi-characters --template typescript`. Additionally, the package.json file and project structure match what would be created by Create React App.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The application manages three separate state values:
  - `characters` state for the character data
  - `loading` state to track the API loading status
  - `error` state to capture and display any API errors

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each list item has a unique key provided by the character's URL: `<li key={character.url}>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  The application properly handles three states:
  - Loading state: Displays "Loading characters..."
  - Error state: Displays "Error: [error message]"
  - If characters array is empty (which would happen after loading if no results were returned), it would render an empty list, which is appropriate behavior.
