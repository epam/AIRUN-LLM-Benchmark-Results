# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The implementation uses Axios to fetch data from the SWAPI API and maps over the resulting character list to render each character's name.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The component renders "Loading characters..." when the loading state is true, providing a clear loading indicator.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  All characters obtained from the API response (`response.data.results`) are displayed using the `.map()` function in a list.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  The code solely focuses on fetching and displaying the list of characters, with no search functionality or input fields present.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each list item displays the character's name and uses the character's URL as a unique key.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The provided instructions and `package.json` details confirm that the project was generated with Create React App using the TypeScript template.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The code uses separate state variables for `characters`, `loading`, and `error`, ensuring clear state management throughout the application lifecycle.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  The implementation assigns each `<li>` element a unique key based on `character.url`, fulfilling React's requirement for unique list keys.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  The code handles loading and error states explicitly. In the case where an empty array of characters is returned, the application would render an empty list. While this behavior is acceptable in many scenarios, it might be enhanced by displaying a "No characters found" message for improved user feedback.  
  (The confidence is 90% because the current implementation results in an empty list without any explicit message to indicate the empty state, but it still meets the basic requirement.)
