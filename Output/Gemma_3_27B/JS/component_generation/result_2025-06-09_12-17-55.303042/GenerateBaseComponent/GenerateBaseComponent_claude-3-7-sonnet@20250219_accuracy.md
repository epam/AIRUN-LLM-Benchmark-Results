# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x
  
  The component imports from 'react' and specifically uses React 18.x features such as modern useState, useRef, and useEffect hooks.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
  
  The code includes TypeScript interfaces (`Option`, `SearchableSelectProps`), type annotations for state variables, and proper TypeScript typing for event handlers and props.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling
  
  The component imports './index.css' and the CSS code is provided separately.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments
  
  The code is well-structured, well-organized, and does not contain any TODO comments or placeholders.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility
  
  The component uses useState hooks for managing state:
  ```typescript
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
  const [selectedOption, setSelectedOption] = useState<Option | null>(null);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props
  
  The component accepts props for options, onChange handler, and an optional placeholder, making it reusable across different contexts.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection
  
  The component includes keyboard event handlers for Enter and Escape keys, and handles keyboard selection for dropdown items.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions
  
  The component uses useRef for DOM element references and properly manages focus using these refs.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques
  
  The component returns focus to the input after selection and manages focus appropriately when the dropdown is opened/closed.

- **Fail** (90%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
  
  The component lacks ARIA attributes like aria-expanded, aria-haspopup, aria-controls, and aria-selected that would improve accessibility. These attributes are important for screen readers to properly interpret the component's state and behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  The code doesn't contain any obvious errors or patterns that would trigger console warnings.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component
  
  The component generally follows good practices to avoid unnecessary re-renders. However, it could potentially be optimized further by using useCallback for event handlers to prevent recreation on each render.
