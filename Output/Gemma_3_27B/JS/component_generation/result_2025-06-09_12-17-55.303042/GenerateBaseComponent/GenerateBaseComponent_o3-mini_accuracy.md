# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  The example assumes a React 18.x environment (e.g., via create-react-app with TypeScript) and uses React functional components that are fully compatible with React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  The implementation is provided in a .tsx file, defining proper interfaces (Option, SearchableSelectProps) and using TypeScriptâ€™s type system.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  The solution shows an import statement "import './index.css'" and includes a complete CSS file with styling rules.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  The code is clear, well-structured, and contains no placeholder comments or incomplete sections.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  The component properly manages state for the search term, dropdown visibility (isOpen), and the selected option using useState.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  The component accepts props such as options, onChange, and a customizable placeholder. This ensures its reusability across different use cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  Keyboard interactions are managed through onKeyDown handlers on both the container and dropdown items for Enter and Escape keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  The useRef hook is used appropriately to manage references for DOM elements (selectRef and inputRef), and event listeners for outside clicks are properly added and removed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  Focus is appropriately managed by returning focus to the input when needed and ensuring interactive elements have tabIndex set for keyboard navigation.

- **Fail** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  Although the component uses tabIndex for keyboard navigation, it does not include any ARIA attributes (such as aria-expanded, aria-haspopup, etc.) to explicitly communicate the dropdown state and role to assistive technologies.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  Based on the provided implementation, there are no obvious sources of console errors or warnings when following React and TypeScript best practices.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  The code appears to properly manage state and events; however, the filteredOptions calculation is done directly in the render body which might cause extra computations on every render if the options list is large. In typical usage, this is not an issue, but for very large data sets, memoization might be considered. For the given context, this is acceptable.
