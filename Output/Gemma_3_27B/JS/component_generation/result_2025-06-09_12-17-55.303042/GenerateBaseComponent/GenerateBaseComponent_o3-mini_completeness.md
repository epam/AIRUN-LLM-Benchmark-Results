# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component returns a main container with a select input and conditionally renders a dropdown list (<ul>) containing the options.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  The code includes an <input> element that handles user search input. Although the search input is rendered as part of the select component rather than embedded inside the dropdown list (<ul>), it serves the intended purpose and filters the options when focused.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The function handleOptionClick properly sets the state for a single selected option and calls the onChange handler with the chosen value.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The component does not implement navigation via the arrow keys. The onKeyDown handler only listens for Enter and Escape keys, and there is no logic for moving focus between different dropdown items using the up/down arrow keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  Each dropdown list item has an onKeyDown event that checks for the Enter key and triggers the selection (handleOptionClick), allowing selection via keyboard.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  The main container’s onKeyDown handler listens for the Enter key and sets isOpen true when the dropdown is closed, thereby toggling visibility as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  After selecting an option or when the Escape key is pressed, the inputRef is focused, ensuring the select component regains focus.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  The handleOptionClick function is called on mouse click and sets isOpen to false, so the dropdown properly closes upon selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  Since selecting an item with the Enter key in the li element calls handleOptionClick, the dropdown is closed, fulfilling the requirement for keyboard-based selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  The onKeyDown handler detects the Escape key and sets isOpen to false; it also re-focuses the input, thereby closing the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  A useEffect hook adds a 'mousedown' event listener that checks if the click is outside the component’s ref, ensuring the dropdown closes accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  The main container handles the Enter key by opening the dropdown when it is not already open.
