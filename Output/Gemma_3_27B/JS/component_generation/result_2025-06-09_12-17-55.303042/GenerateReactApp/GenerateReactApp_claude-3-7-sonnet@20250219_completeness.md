# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The application fetches Star Wars characters from the SWAPI API (`https://swapi.dev/api/people`) using axios and displays them in a list. The code maps through the characters array and renders each character's name in a list item.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The application implements a loading state which is initially set to true. While loading, it returns `<div>Loading characters...</div>` to indicate that data is being fetched.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The code maps through all characters in the array returned by the API and renders each one in the UI: `{characters.map((character) => (<li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>))}`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  The code doesn't implement any search functionality or include any user input fields. It simply fetches and displays the characters without filtering options.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character is displayed in a list item with its name: `<li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The instructions include using Create React App with TypeScript template: `npx create-react-app swapi-characters --template typescript`. The package.json file also includes dependencies typical of a Create React App project.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The application uses React's useState hook to manage three states:
  - `characters` for storing the character data
  - `loading` for tracking the API call status
  - `error` for handling error states

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each list item uses the character's URL as a unique key: `<li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  The application handles three possible states:
  - Loading state: Shows "Loading characters..."
  - Error state: Shows "Error: [error message]"
  - Data state: Shows the list of characters, which would be empty if no characters were returned
