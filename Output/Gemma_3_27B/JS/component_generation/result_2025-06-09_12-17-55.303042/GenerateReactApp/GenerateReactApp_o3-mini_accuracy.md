# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses React 18.x or newer by checking the package.json dependencies  
  The package.json includes "react": "^18.2.0", which confirms that React 18.x is used.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that TypeScript is properly implemented with appropriate type definitions for all components, props, and states  
  The code uses TypeScript with defined interfaces (Character and ApiResponse) as well as proper typing for state variables and the functional component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Axios is used for API requests to fetch data from the Star Wars API endpoint  
  Axios is imported and used in the fetchCharacters async function with a typed API response.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles API errors gracefully with appropriate error states or messages  
  The use of a try...catch block and setting of an error message in state ensures that API errors are caught and displayed to the user.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the character data is fetched on component mount using useEffect hook  
  The fetchCharacters function is called inside a useEffect hook with an empty dependency array, ensuring it runs on mount.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application properly manages component rendering optimization  
  The application uses React hooks and state changes to handle re-renders appropriately. Although no advanced optimizations (such as memoization) are used, the implementation is sufficient for the applicationâ€™s needs.  
  (Confidence is slightly less than 100% because advanced optimizations might be considered in more complex scenarios.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows React best practices using hooks appropriately  
  All hooks (useState and useEffect) are correctly used, and the code maintains clear separation of concerns.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't contain any TODO comments or unnecessary code  
  The code is free from TODO comments and appears clean and focused.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the codebase has minimal comments that only clarify complex logic when necessary  
  Comments in the code are minimal and used primarily for clarity and explanation where needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the API endpoint 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' is being called correctly  
  The axios.get call correctly requests data from 'https://swapi.dev/api/people', and the response is properly typed.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that the application renders without console errors or warnings  
  Based on the provided code, no obvious issues should cause console errors or warnings. However, without executing the code in a live environment, there is a slight uncertainty.
