# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The code fetches data from the SWAPI API and uses the retrieved array (response.data.results) to render a list of characters. Each character is displayed in an <li> element.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  Prior to data retrieval, the application conditionally returns a “Loading characters…” message when the loading state is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  The application iterates over the fetched characters array with the map function and displays each character’s name in the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  There is no implementation of any search feature or user input fields in the provided code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  The list item for each character displays the character’s name (character.name) appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The instructions include using Create React App and the provided package.json reflects a typical CRA project structure, confirming its usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The application utilizes React’s useState hook to manage loading, error, and character states, and the useEffect hook to handle the API call on component mount.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  Each list element uses a unique key (character.url), which is an appropriate identifier for React’s list rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  If the API returns an empty list, the component will render the header with an empty list. Although an explicit “no data available” message is not shown, the empty array is handled gracefully without causing errors.
