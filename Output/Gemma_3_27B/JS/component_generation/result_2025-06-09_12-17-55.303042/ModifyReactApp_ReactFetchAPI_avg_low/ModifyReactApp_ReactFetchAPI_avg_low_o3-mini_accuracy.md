# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type  
  The onChange handler (handleSearchChange) correctly updates the searchTerm state and triggers the API call.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls  
  The code calls the fetchCharacters function on every keystroke without any debouncing mechanism, meaning there’s no delay to wait for the user to stop typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured  
  The code imports axios and uses axios.get with the appropriate URL and type annotations.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses  
  Interfaces for Character and ApiResponse are defined, and the component and its functions specify TypeScript types.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters  
  The endpoint is constructed dynamically with the search query (https://swapi.dev/api/people?search=${searchQuery}), which meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate  
  The fetchCharacters function is wrapped in useCallback, preventing unnecessary re-renders as it is used as a dependency in useEffect.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback  
  The code includes a try...catch block. It logs errors and clears previous results; however, it does not display any explicit error message to the user, which could be improved to meet the “appropriate user feedback” requirement. (Confidence slightly less than 100% because the feedback strategy might be acceptable in minimal implementations, but typically explicit user feedback is preferred.)

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing  
  There is no mechanism (like debouncing) in place to ensure that API calls are delayed until the user stops typing. The fetchCharacters function is invoked on every keystroke.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices  
  The implementation cleanly separates the state for the initial data (characters) and the filtered data (searchResults).

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code  
  The code is well-organized, and there is no evidence of unused imports or commented-out code sections.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests  
  The loading state is correctly set to true before the API call and false afterward regardless of success or failure.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns  
  The component uses React.FC, hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback), and follows modern React best practices.
