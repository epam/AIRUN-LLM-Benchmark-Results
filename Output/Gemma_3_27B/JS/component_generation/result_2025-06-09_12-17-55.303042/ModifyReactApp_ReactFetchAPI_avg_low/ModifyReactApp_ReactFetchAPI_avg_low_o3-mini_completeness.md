# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The component renders an input field with placeholder "Search characters..." and uses its onChange event to trigger the search functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  The component conditionally returns a "Loading..." message when the loading state is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  The useEffect hook calls fetchCharacters (with its default empty searchQuery) on mount, ensuring initial data is loaded.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  The handleSearchChange event handler calls fetchCharacters with the updated search term on each input change, dynamically updating the search results.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  The code checks if searchResults is empty while a search term exists and displays a message "No results found for ..." accordingly.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The solution uses standard HTML input and list elements which are inherently flexible. However, no explicit responsive styling (e.g., media queries) is applied. This is acceptable for a basic implementation, though more complex use cases might benefit from detailed responsive CSS.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  The component maps over the searchResults array to render a list of characters, confirming that data fetched from the API is displayed properly.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  While error handling is performed with a try...catch block in the fetchCharacters function, the component does not include an error boundary to catch errors at the component tree level. The explanation suggests considering an error boundary for production use, but it is not implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The code defines interfaces for Character and ApiResponse, and it uses appropriate types for state variables and function parameters throughout.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The solution enhances the original character listing with search functionality without removing any existing features, ensuring the original data loading and display mechanisms are preserved.
