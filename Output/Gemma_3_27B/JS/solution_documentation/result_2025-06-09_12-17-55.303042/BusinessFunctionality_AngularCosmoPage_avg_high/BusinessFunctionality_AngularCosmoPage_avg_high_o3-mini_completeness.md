- **Fail** (90%): Confirm the documentation describes the page duplication feature  
  Although a "Duplicate" button is listed under UI Components, the documentation does not further explain the duplication workflow or its functionality.  
  Reason for less than 100% confidence: The mention of the button is not accompanied by an explanation or a detailed workflow, leaving ambiguity regarding its behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains the page deletion process  
  The deletion process is described in a workflow that instructs users to click "Delete", confirm the deletion via a dialog, and proceed by clicking "Yes".

- **Fail** (90%): Validate the documentation explains error handling during API operations  
  While notifications for validations are mentioned (using `$rootScope.$broadcast('notify'`), there is no detailed explanation of error handling if API calls fail or behave unexpectedly.  
  Reason for less than 100% confidence: The documentation touches on validation messaging but falls short of detailing robust error handling mechanisms for API operations.

  The use of notification messaging via broadcasting is mentioned as part of the user feedback system.
