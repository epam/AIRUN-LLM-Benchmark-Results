  The document explicitly states that the name must be between 3 and 60 characters, the email must be a valid address, and the password must be at least 6 characters long.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation correctly explains the asynchronous validation for checking existing usernames and emails  
  It details that asynchronous validation is used to check if a username or email already exists via calls to the API endpoints.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately describes the form submission process and API interaction  
  The documentation explains that upon form submission, data is sent to the backend API for user creation and that Redux actions are dispatched for handling the post-signup state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation correctly explains the Redux integration for state management  
  The report mentions integration with redux-form, Redux actions, and the Redux store for form state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation accurately describes the form feedback mechanisms for validation errors  
  It covers real-time validation feedback, the display of error messages below each input field, and the disabled state for the submit button during validation or submission.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately describes the FormGroup component's role in displaying validation feedback  
  The document states that the FormGroup is used to wrap input fields and provide visual feedback (using React Bootstrapâ€™s properties like hasFeedback and bsStyle) based on the validation status.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation correctly explains the Promise-based architecture for parallel validation checks  
  The documentation explicitly mentions that the asyncValidate function uses Promise.all to perform asynchronous validations in parallel.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation accurately describes the user flow from form completion to successful signup  
  It outlines the step-by-step flow from landing on the signup page, through form filling and real-time validation, to the final submission and handling of responses.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately explains the error handling during form submission  
  The report explains how both client-side and asynchronous validation errors are displayed and how API errors during signup are caught and handled.
