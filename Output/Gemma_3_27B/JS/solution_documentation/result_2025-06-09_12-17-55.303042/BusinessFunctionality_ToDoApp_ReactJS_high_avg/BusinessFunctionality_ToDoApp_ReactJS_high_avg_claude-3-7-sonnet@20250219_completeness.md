    The document mentions a Utils class that provides a pluralize function: "Provides helper functions for generating unique IDs (`uuid`), pluralizing words (`pluralize`), and interacting with `localStorage`..." However, it doesn't explicitly state that this function is used for the item/items counter text. While it's strongly implied that the pluralize function handles this common UI pattern, there isn't a direct statement confirming this specific use case.
