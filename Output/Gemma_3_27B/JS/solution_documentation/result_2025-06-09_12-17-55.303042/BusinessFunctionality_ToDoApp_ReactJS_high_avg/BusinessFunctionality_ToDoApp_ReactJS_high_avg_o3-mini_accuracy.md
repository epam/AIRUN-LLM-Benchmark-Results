# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document identifies the application as a Todo list management application  
  The document clearly states that it outlines a Todo application and details functionalities such as adding, editing, toggling, and deleting tasks.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the component structure (TodoApp, TodoItem, TodoFooter)  
  The document outlines the structure for key components including TodoApp, TodoItem, TodoFooter, TodoModel, and Utils, providing clear responsibilities for each.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of local storage for data persistence  
  The document explicitly mentions the use of the browser's localStorage for persisting the Todo list across sessions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the state management approach using the TodoModel  
  The document explains how the TodoModel manages data, notifies components via an observer pattern, and coordinates state updates between components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the routing mechanism for filtering todos  
  The document mentions that routing (filtering of todos) is handled using a custom Router object, acknowledging that it is not a standard routing solution.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the event handling for user interactions  
  The document covers various user interaction patterns such as adding, editing, toggling, and deleting todos, and explains how event handling triggers corresponding actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of immutable data structures for state management  
  The document indicates the use of functional programming techniques like map and filter to manipulate arrays immutably, which is a common practice for state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the performance optimization using shouldComponentUpdate  
  The document notes that TodoItem implements shouldComponentUpdate to prevent unnecessary re-renders, clearly stating the performance optimization method used.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of the Utils class for helper functions  
  The document explains the role of the Utils class in providing helper functions for generating unique IDs, pluralizing words, and interacting with localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the data flow between components  
  The document describes a unidirectional data flow pattern, explaining how user interactions update the TodoModel, which then notifies components to re-render, thereby ensuring clarity of the data flow process.
