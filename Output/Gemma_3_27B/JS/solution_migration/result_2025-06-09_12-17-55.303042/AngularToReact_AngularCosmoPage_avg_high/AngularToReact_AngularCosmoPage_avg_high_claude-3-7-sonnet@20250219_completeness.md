# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (95%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented

    The provided code shows the basic Redux structure for page management with a `pageSlice.ts` that includes state for a page, but it does not explicitly implement create, update, delete, or duplicate functionality. The code includes a `setPage` reducer but lacks specific actions for other operations. The `PageEditor` component shows a basic form with only a title field, without complete CRUD operations.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present

    The provided code does not implement page type selection functionality. While the Page interface in `types/Page.ts` includes a `type` field, there is no UI component or logic for selecting different page types.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists

    There is no implementation of URL auto-generation from title functionality in the provided code. The `PageEditor` component only shows a basic title input without any logic for URL generation.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented

    The code mentions a `TagInput.tsx` component in the project structure, but no implementation is provided. The Redux store has a `suggestions` state in the page slice, but there's no actual implementation of tag management with autocomplete.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available

    The provided code does not implement publish status options. While the Page interface includes `published` and `published_date` fields, there's no UI or logic for selecting between publish, draft, or schedule options.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented

    The Page interface includes a `published_date` field, but there is no implementation of date selection functionality or scheduling logic in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present

    The pageSlice includes a `newerVersion` state, suggesting intention to implement version comparison, but there is no actual implementation of local storage version comparison or restoration features in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented

    The provided code does not include any notification system for success or error messages. There's no implementation of toast notifications or any other messaging system.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present

    The provided code does not implement form validation. The `PageEditor` component only has a basic title input without any validation logic for required fields.

- **Fail** (95%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled

    The code includes a basic API service in `restApi.ts` with only one method (`getBlocks`). It does not comprehensively cover all API endpoints that would be needed for full functionality. The implementation is minimal and incomplete.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented

    While the Page interface includes an `extras` array, there is no implementation of extras management functionality in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained

    The provided code does not implement any revision history functionality. There's no UI or logic for managing or viewing revisions.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components

    The code demonstrates a good organization structure with separate folders for app logic (store, slices, API), components, pages, internationalization, and types. There is a clear separation between business logic (Redux slices) and UI components. However, the implementation is still very basic and incomplete.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved

    The code mentions an `i18n` folder in the project structure and lists dependencies for `i18next` and `react-i18next`, but there's no actual implementation of translation functionality in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters

    The provided code does not include router configuration or any implementation that would demonstrate maintaining the same URL structure and parameters as the original application.
