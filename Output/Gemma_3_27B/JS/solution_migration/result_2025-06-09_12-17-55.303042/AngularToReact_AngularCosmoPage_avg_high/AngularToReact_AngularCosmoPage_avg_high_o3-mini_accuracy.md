# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props.  
  Although all code files use TypeScript and key data models (Page, User) are well defined, some components (like PageEditorProps) have minimal prop definitions and could benefit from more explicit type annotations. This assessment is given 90% confidence due to potential room for enhancing strictness.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management.  
  Both pageSlice and userSlice are correctly implemented with createSlice from Redux Toolkit.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components.  
  All components provided, including PageEditor, are functional components.

- **Pass** (80%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately.  
  The answer uses useState and useEffect correctly. However, useCallback and useMemo are not employed. Their absence may be acceptable given the current code complexity, but could be considered for optimization in more complex scenarios. Hence the slightly lower confidence.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource.  
  The code uses axios for API calls in restApi.ts, meeting the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components.  
  The PageEditor component manages input state using useState, which is the standard controlled component pattern.

- **Fail** (70%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation.  
  Although the project outline mentions react-router-dom and includes a pages directory, the provided code does not show any explicit routing logic or usage of React Router components. This leads to a failure in demonstrating full navigation implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization.  
  The project includes i18next and react-i18next along with a dedicated i18n folder for translation files.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization.  
  There is no evidence of code splitting techniques (e.g., React.lazy, Suspense) being used in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations.  
  The example does not include usages of React.memo to optimize rendering, even for components that might benefit from it.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks.  
  The useEffect in the PageEditor component includes a dependency array containing dispatch, which is appropriately managed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models.  
  Interfaces for Page and User are provided, ensuring clear TypeScript definitions for the data models used.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state.  
  The useSelector hook in PageEditor is correctly used to access the page state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations.  
  Both pageSlice and userSlice correctly create and export action creators.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks.  
  There is no implementation or usage of local storage functionality in the provided code; the outline only mentions it as a next step.
