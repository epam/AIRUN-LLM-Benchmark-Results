# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
  The answer only demonstrates a basic page editing interface that fetches and sets page data. There is no evidence for create, update, delete, or duplicate functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
  Although the page interface and data structure include a "type" field, there is no implementation for a UI element or logic that allows the user to select a page type.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
  The code shows an input for the title, but there is no functionality that automatically generates or updates the URL based on the title.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
  While the project structure mentions a "TagInput.tsx" component, no code or functionality is provided that demonstrates autocomplete or tag management features.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
  There is no evidence in the provided code that displays or allows the user to choose between publish, draft, or schedule options.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
  Although a "published_date" field exists in the Page type, there is no functionality or UI to schedule publishing or handle scheduling logic.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
  There is no implementation shown that uses local storage to compare or restore versions of page data.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
  The answer does not include any mechanism for displaying notifications to indicate success or error states during operations.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
  The provided PageEditor component does not showcase any form validation logic to enforce required fields like URL or page type.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
  Only a single API endpoint for "getBlocks" is implemented, with no evidence that other required endpoints from the original code are handled.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
  Although the Page type includes an "extras" field, there is no corresponding functionality that shows how extras are managed in the UI or in state management.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
  There is no mention or implementation of any revision history feature which should allow users to track changes or restore previous versions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
  The project structure clearly separates the application into folders such as "app", "components", "pages", and "types", which indicates a separation of business logic (Redux slices, API services) from UI components.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
  An "i18n/" directory and references to internationalization (react-i18next) are present, suggesting that translation functionality is taken into account. However, no detailed implementation is shown, so there remains a slight uncertainty regarding full translation coverage.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
  There is only a brief mention of routing via react-router-dom in the structure without any demonstration that the URL structure or parameters from the original application are maintained.
