# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling
  
  The component clearly uses Angular's Reactive Forms approach. It imports `FormBuilder`, `FormGroup`, and `Validators` from '@angular/forms', initializes a FormGroup in the ngOnInit method, and uses formGroup directives in the template.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)
  
  The form setup includes appropriate validators:
  - Name: `[Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3), Validators.maxLength(60)]`
  - Email: `[Validators.required, Validators.email]`
  - Password: `[Validators.required, Validators.minLength(6)]`

- **Pass** (90%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use
  
  The component includes async validators for name and email through the `asyncValidators` property of the form group. However, there appears to be an implementation issue in the `CustomValidators` class where the methods don't actually use the API responses properly, which makes me slightly less confident.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched
  
  While the component displays error messages when fields are touched, it uses `className` attributes in the HTML template instead of the Angular attribute `class`. This is React syntax, not Angular. The proper syntax would be `class="form-control"` instead of `className="form-control"`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions
  
  The `onSubmit` method properly checks form validity, calls the API service's signup method, and dispatches the appropriate action (`AuthActions.signupComplete`) on success.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails
  
  Error messages are conditionally displayed using `*ngIf` directives when validation fails and the field is touched or the form is being submitted.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service
  
  The component injects a `TitleService` and calls `this.titleService.setTitle('Signup')` in ngOnInit.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management
  
  The component imports `Store` from '@ngrx/store' and dispatches actions upon successful signup, indicating it uses NgRx for state management. However, there's no direct evidence of @ngrx/effects usage in the provided code, though it's likely part of the broader application architecture.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress
  
  The submit button has a `[disabled]="submitting"` attribute, and the `submitting` flag is properly managed in the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses
  
  The component handles success by dispatching an action and navigating to the login page, and handles errors by setting the submitting flag back to false and displaying an error message.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management
  
  There are structure issues:
  1. The async validators are defined as instance methods but are used in the form group initialization before they're bound to the component instance.
  2. The HTML template uses React-style attributes (`className`, `htmlFor`) instead of Angular attributes (`class`, `for`).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises
  
  The `ApiService` properly uses Angular's `HttpClient` for API calls and returns Observables, not Promises.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements
  
  The template uses `formGroupName` incorrectly. It should be used for nested form groups, not for individual form controls. The correct approach would be to use `formControlName` for individual controls within the form group.
