# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component includes all three required form fields: name, email, and password
  
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page includes a heading 'Join PodBaby today.'
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a lead paragraph about membership benefits
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form includes a submit button with appropriate styling and icon
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a link to the login page with appropriate text
  
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the FormGroup component or equivalent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display
  
- **Fail** (100%): Verify the Icon component or equivalent is implemented for the signup button
  
  The submit button in the HTML template does not include any icon component or implementation. The button only contains text:
  
  ```html
  <button type="submit" className="btn btn-primary" [disabled]="submitting">
    Signup
  </button>
  ```
  
  There is no icon element, no icon class, and no reference to any icon library like Font Awesome or Material Icons.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all validation rules are implemented (name length, email format, password length)
  
- **Pass** (90%): Ensure asynchronous validation for both name and email uniqueness is implemented
  
  The code includes asynchronous validation methods for both name and email uniqueness checks. However, there appears to be an implementation issue in the `CustomValidators` class where the validators always return either null or an error object regardless of the actual API response. The validators don't properly connect to the API results, which might cause validation to not work correctly in practice.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API integration is complete with proper error handling
  
- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the form layout matches the horizontal form structure specified
  
  The HTML template uses `className` attributes instead of the correct Angular `class` attribute. In Angular, we should use `class="form-horizontal"` instead of `className="form-horizontal"`. This appears consistently throughout the template and would prevent the proper application of CSS classes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page has proper document title setting functionality
