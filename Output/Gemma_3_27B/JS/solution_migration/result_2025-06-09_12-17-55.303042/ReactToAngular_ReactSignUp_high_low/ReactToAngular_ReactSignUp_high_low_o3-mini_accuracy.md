# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The component imports FormBuilder and uses fb.group to create the form.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The signupForm is built with Validators.required, Validators.minLength, Validators.maxLength, and Validators.email appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  The component adds asyncValidators (asyncValidateName and asyncValidateEmail) that invoke the API service and custom validators to check availability.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The HTML template displays error messages based on the control’s invalid status and whether it has been touched or if a submission is in progress.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  The onSubmit method calls apiService.signup and, on success, dispatches AuthActions.signupComplete and navigates to the login page.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The template includes conditional blocks that show error messages (e.g., required, minlength, maxlength, and availability errors) under each field.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  The ngOnInit method calls titleService.setTitle('Signup') to update the document title.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  While the code uses @ngrx/store (dispatching an action via store.dispatch), there is no direct evidence of @ngrx/effects usage in the component. Typically, effects are set up outside the component. The evaluation requirement specifically mentions both, so this step is marked as failed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button is disabled via [disabled]="submitting", ensuring the button is inactive during submission.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  On a successful signup, the component dispatches an action and routes to the login page; on error, it resets the submitting flag and sets form errors accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component uses dependency injection, lifecycle hooks (ngOnInit), and separates concerns (with services for API and title management), which aligns with Angular best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The ApiService utilizes Angular’s HttpClient to make HTTP requests.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The error messages in the template align with the specified requirements (e.g., required, email format, length, and custom errors for name/email availability).
