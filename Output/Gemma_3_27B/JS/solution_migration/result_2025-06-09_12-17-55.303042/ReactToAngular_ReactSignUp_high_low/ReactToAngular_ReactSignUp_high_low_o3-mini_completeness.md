# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component includes all three required form fields (name, email, and password).  
  All three fields are defined in the component’s form group and corresponding input elements exist in the template.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page includes a heading "Join PodBaby today."  
  The template contains an <h2> element with the exact text "Join PodBaby today."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a lead paragraph about membership benefits.  
  The template includes a <p> element with the class "lead" that explains the benefits of joining.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the form includes a submit button with appropriate styling and icon.  
  While the form includes a submit button with Bootstrap styling (class "btn btn-primary"), there is no icon implemented within the button as the evaluation step requires.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a link to the login page with appropriate text.  
  A link is present (using Angular’s routerLink) and displays the text "Already a member? Log in here."

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the FormGroup component or equivalent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display.  
  The form utilizes an Angular FormGroup, and error messages are conditionally rendered for each form control.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the Icon component or equivalent is implemented for the signup button.  
  There is no evidence that an Icon component (or equivalent) is used for the signup button; the button only contains text.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all validation rules are implemented (name length, email format, password length).  
  Validators for required fields, minimum and maximum lengths, and proper email format are applied as specified in the component.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure asynchronous validation for both name and email uniqueness is implemented.  
  Both async validation functions (asyncValidateName and asyncValidateEmail) are present and make API calls to check availability.  
  (The slight deduction is due to potential integration concerns with the usage of CustomValidators inside the RxJS pipe, though the intent is clear.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API integration is complete with proper error handling.  
  The onSubmit method makes a signup API call, dispatches an action on success, and handles errors by updating the form’s error state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form layout matches the horizontal form structure specified.  
  The template uses the "form-horizontal" class along with "col-sm-2" for labels and "col-sm-10" for input containers, consistent with horizontal layout conventions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page has proper document title setting functionality.  
  The component invokes titleService.setTitle('Signup') in its ngOnInit, ensuring the document title is updated accordingly.
