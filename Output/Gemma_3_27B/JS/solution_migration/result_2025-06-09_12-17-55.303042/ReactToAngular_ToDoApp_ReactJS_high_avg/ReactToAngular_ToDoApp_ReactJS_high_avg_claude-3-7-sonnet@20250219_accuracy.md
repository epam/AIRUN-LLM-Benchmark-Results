# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The provided code clearly shows the use of Angular framework. It references Angular 14.x specific imports like `@Component`, `@Injectable`, etc., and uses Angular CLI commands like `ng new` and `ng add`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
  
  The code includes installation of NgRx packages with `ng add @ngrx/store` and implements store functionality with imports from '@ngrx/store', store selectors, and dispatching actions through the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
  
  NgRx effects are properly implemented in the `TodoEffects` class which uses `@ngrx/effects` to handle side effects like saving todos to local storage.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
  
  The implementation includes properly defined actions (addTodo, toggleTodo, etc.), reducers with state management logic, and selectors (selectTodos, selectNowShowing, selectEditing).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
  
  Components like TodoAppComponent and TodoItemComponent use proper Angular decorators including @Component for the components themselves and @Input/@Output for component communication.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators
  
  There is no explicit implementation of @ViewChild decorators to replace React refs in the provided code. While many React patterns are properly migrated, this specific transformation is not clearly demonstrated.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
  
  The TodoItemComponent properly implements @Input() for property binding (todo, editing) and @Output() with EventEmitter for event handling (onToggle, onDestroy, onEdit, etc.).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
  
  The code includes an Angular service (UtilsService) with `@Injectable()` decorator that provides utility functions for the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
  
  Dependency injection is implemented correctly with services injected through constructors (e.g., `constructor(private store: Store)` in TodoAppComponent).

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
  
  While the answer mentions change detection strategies in the "Key Considerations & Next Steps" section, there is no actual implementation of OnPush change detection in the provided components.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
  
  The answer mentions configuring Angular Router in `app-routing.module.ts` to match the React Router setup, and includes `@ngrx/router-store` in the installation. However, the specific routing implementation is not provided in detail.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code follows Angular conventions for naming, file organization, and coding patterns. Component files are appropriately named with `.component.ts` extensions and follow proper Angular structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
  
  TypeScript interfaces (ITodo, IAppState, IAppProps) are properly defined and used throughout the application for strong typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
  
  The provided code includes Angular HTML templates (e.g., todo-app.component.html) that replace JSX templates from React, using Angular-specific syntax like *ngFor and *ngIf.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
  
  React event handlers like onClick are properly replaced with Angular event bindings like (click), (change), (keydown), etc.

- **Fail** (80%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs
  
  The provided code doesn't explicitly contain TODOs, but the author does mention that this is not a complete implementation, indicating there are areas that would need further work. The statement "I can't provide a complete, runnable codebase in a single response" suggests there are still tasks to complete.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules
  
  Lazy loading is mentioned in the "Key Considerations & Next Steps" section as something to implement, but there is no actual implementation of lazy loading shown in the code.
