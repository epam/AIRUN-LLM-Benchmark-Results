# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items

    The code includes a `todos$` observable in the `TodoAppComponent` that selects todos from the store, and the HTML template includes a loop to display these items. The implementation appears correct, but without seeing the actual rendering code for individual todos and testing the application, I cannot be 100% confident.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented

    The code includes an `addTodo` action and corresponding reducer logic. The `TodoAppComponent` has an `addTodo` method and the template includes an input field with a keydown handler for adding new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works

    The implementation includes a `toggleTodo` action, corresponding reducer logic, and the `TodoItemComponent` has the necessary input/output bindings to handle toggling todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented

    The code includes `setEditing` and `saveTodo` actions with corresponding reducer logic. The `TodoItemComponent` has the necessary inputs/outputs for handling edit mode, including methods for handling edits, submissions, and cancellations.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented

    The code includes a `destroyTodo` action with corresponding reducer logic. The `TodoItemComponent` has a delete button that emits an event to trigger deletion.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented

    The implementation includes a `toggleAll` action with corresponding reducer logic. The `TodoAppComponent` template includes a checkbox input with a change handler that calls the `toggleAll` method.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works

    The code includes a `setNowShowing` action with corresponding reducer logic to track the current filter. While the implementation suggests that filtering works, the actual filtering logic is not explicitly shown in the provided code snippets, which is why I'm not 100% confident.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items

    The `TodoAppComponent` template includes an `app-todo-footer` component with a `[count]` input that is bound to the count of incomplete todos. However, without seeing the footer component implementation, I'm not 100% confident.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items

    The code includes a `clearCompleted` action with corresponding reducer logic. The `TodoAppComponent` binds to a `(onClearCompleted)` output from the footer component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage

    The implementation includes a `TodoEffects` class that listens for actions that modify todos and saves them to local storage using a `Utils.store` method.

- **Fail** (80%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation

    While the code mentions configuring Angular Router in `app-routing.module.ts` to match the React Router setup, no actual routing configuration is provided in the code snippets. Without seeing the routing configuration, I cannot confirm that the URL structure is maintained.

- **Fail** (70%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states

    The provided code does not explicitly handle empty states for the todo list. The main section is conditionally rendered based on todo count, but there's no specific UI shown for when there are no todos.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly

    The code includes form submission handling for adding new todos and editing existing todos. The implementation uses Angular's event binding to handle keyboard events and form submissions. However, without seeing all validation logic, I cannot be 100% confident.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships

    The code shows a clear component hierarchy with proper data flow between components using inputs and outputs. The `TodoAppComponent` serves as the container component that interacts with the NgRx store, and child components like `TodoItemComponent` receive data and emit events.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved

    The implementation appears to preserve the core business logic of a todo application, including adding, toggling, editing, and deleting todos, as well as filtering and persisting data. However, without comparing directly to the original React code, I cannot be 100% confident that all business logic is preserved.
