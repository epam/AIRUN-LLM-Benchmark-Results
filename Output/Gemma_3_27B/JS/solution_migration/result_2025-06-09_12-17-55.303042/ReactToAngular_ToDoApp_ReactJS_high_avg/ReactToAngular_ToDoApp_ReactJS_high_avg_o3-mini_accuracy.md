# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  Although the code uses standard Angular CLI setup (ng new angular-todo) and modern Angular constructs, the Angular version isn’t explicitly mentioned. Based on the context and coding style, it appears Angular 14.x is assumed. 

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The answer clearly shows the use of NgRx with the command "ng add @ngrx/store" and proper use of selectors, actions, and reducers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  An effects file (todo.effects.ts) is provided and correctly set up to handle side effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  The provided code defines actions, reducers, and selectors in a clear and functional manner.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  The components, such as TodoAppComponent and TodoItemComponent, correctly use @Component, @Input, and @Output decorators.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  There is no demonstration of converting any React ref usage to Angular’s @ViewChild. If the original React implementation relied on refs, the migration should show how they are replaced. This step has not been addressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  The TodoItemComponent shows clear use of @Input and @Output for transferring data and events between components.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  Although a UtilsService is provided, the main business logic and data handling occur within the NgRx store and reducers. There is minimal demonstration of using Angular services for data handling beyond a utility function, which may be insufficient based on the evaluation criteria.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  Dependency injection is demonstrated (e.g., injecting Store in components and Actions in effects), which aligns with Angular’s DI practices.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  The code does not apply or mention any change detection strategies (such as OnPush), which can be important for performance in Angular applications.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  The answer mentions configuring Angular Router in the routing module. However, no detailed routing code is shown. It is assumed that the migration would include this setup but the implementation details are omitted.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The overall structure, file organization, and code style appear to follow Angular conventions and best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  Multiple TypeScript interfaces (e.g., ITodo, IAppState) are defined and used consistently throughout the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  The provided templates are standard Angular HTML, with no remnants of JSX syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  Event handling is adapted to Angular’s syntax (using (click), (keydown), etc.), replacing React’s event system.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  No TODO comments or placeholders are present in the provided code.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  While the answer mentions lazy loading as a next step, there is no actual implementation or code snippet demonstrating lazy loading for feature modules.
