# Evaluation Report

Below is the evaluation of the provided answer against the specified evaluation steps.  
Each step is marked as Pass or Fail along with our confidence level.

1. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
   The code uses an *ngFor loop in the TodoApp’s template to iterate through todos. This meets the requirement.

2. **Fail** (95%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
   While the component includes an addTodo() method and dispatches an action to add a todo, the template uses a keydown event handler (handleNewTodoKeyDown) that is never implemented in the provided code. This inconsistency suggests incomplete integration of the add functionality.

3. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
   The TodoItem component includes an input checkbox that emits an event to toggle the todo, and the TodoAppComponent dispatches a toggleTodo action. This meets the requirement.

4. **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
   Both the TodoItem and TodoApp components include methods (handleEdit, saveTodo, setEditing) that support editing a todo item. This requirement is satisfied.

5. **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
   The provided code for the TodoItem component includes a “destroy” button that emits an event to delete a todo, and the TodoAppComponent dispatches the destroyTodo action accordingly.

6. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
   There is a toggle-all checkbox in the TodoAppComponent template calling the toggleAll method, and the reducer handles toggling all todos based on the provided checked status.

7. **Fail** (80%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
   The code includes a nowShowing state and an action (setNowShowing) related to filtering; however, there is no clear implementation of filtering logic in the component’s template or via selectors. Thus, it is not fully evident that filtering by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' is implemented.

8. **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
   The footer component is provided with a count calculated by filtering the todos for those not completed. This implementation meets the requirement.

9. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
   A clearCompleted action is dispatched and the reducer correctly filters out completed todos. This functionality is appropriately implemented.

10. **Fail** (90%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
    The initial state uses Utils.store to load todos, and an effect is intended to save to local storage. However, the TodoEffects implementation appears problematic (accessing this.actions$.value.todos is not standard for NgRx Effects), which could mean persistence does not work properly.

11. **Fail** (90%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
    While there is a mention of configuring Angular Router to match the React Router setup, no concrete routing implementation or URL structure details are provided. This omission results in a failure to fully confirm URL consistency.

12. **Pass** (80%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
    The template uses *ngIf to conditionally display the main section and footer based on the presence of todos. Although no explicit message is provided for empty states, the absence of items leads to a simpler UI which is arguably acceptable. This is borderline pass due to lack of explicit empty state UI messaging.

13. **Fail** (90%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
    There is handling for keydown, blur, and change events in the TodoItem component and an addTodo method defined. However, the missing handleNewTodoKeyDown method in the TodoAppComponent suggests that form submission (specifically when adding a new todo) is not properly handled.

14. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
    Components interact via clearly defined @Input and @Output bindings, and they correctly utilize NgRx for state management. This arrangement upholds proper component relationships.

15. **Fail** (80%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
    Most of the core functionality (adding, editing, toggling, deleting todos, etc.) has been mapped to NgRx actions and reducers. However, some aspects such as filtering logic and local storage persistence are either under-implemented or potentially incorrect, meaning not all business logic is fully preserved.
