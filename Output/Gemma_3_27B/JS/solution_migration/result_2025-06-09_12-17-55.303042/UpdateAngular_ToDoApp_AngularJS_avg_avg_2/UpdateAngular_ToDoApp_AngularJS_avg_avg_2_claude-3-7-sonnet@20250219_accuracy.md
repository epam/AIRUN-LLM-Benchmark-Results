# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators
- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators
  
  The answer mentions the need to convert AngularJS directives like `todoFocus` and `todoEscape` to Angular directives using `@HostListener` and `@HostBinding`, but doesn't provide an actual implementation with the `@Directive` decorator. A proper implementation would include a class with the `@Directive` decorator.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))
- **Fail** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])
  
  While the answer covers Angular syntax in general, it doesn't specifically demonstrate property binding using the `[property]` syntax or class binding using `[class.property]`. The provided template examples don't include these specific syntaxes.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed
  
  The answer mentions Angular lifecycle hooks like `ngOnInit` and shows an implementation in the `TodoListComponent`, but doesn't comprehensively cover all lifecycle hooks that might be needed in a full todo application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services
- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  While most of the code follows Angular style conventions, there's some inconsistency in naming conventions. For example, `todoStorageService` should be `TodoStorageService` following PascalCase for class names.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings
  
  This cannot be verified as the provided solution is a code outline rather than a running application. The answer even explicitly states: "I can't provide a complete, runnable application in a single response."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code
- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design
  
  The answer outlines components with specific responsibilities (TodoListComponent, TodoItemComponent, etc.), but without complete implementations, it's difficult to fully assess whether the single responsibility principle is consistently applied throughout the entire application.
