# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list
  
  The answer includes a `TodoListComponent` that's specifically designed to display the list of todos. This is evident from the provided code snippet with a constructor, ngOnInit method, and a corresponding HTML template that iterates through todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos
  
  The answer mentions creating a `TodoFormComponent` which "Handles adding new todos."

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos
  
  While not explicitly named as a separate component, the code structure suggests editing functionality would be implemented. The confidence is lower because the answer mentions `TodoItemComponent` but doesn't explicitly state it handles editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos
  
  The answer mentions a `FooterComponent` that "Displays the todo count and filters."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics
  
  The `FooterComponent` is described as displaying "the todo count and filters." Additionally, there is a `selectRemainingCount` selector defined specifically for this purpose.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos
  
  The answer includes an `addTodo` action and corresponding reducer logic that adds a new todo to the state.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos
  
  While editing is not explicitly defined as an action, the application structure with NgRx suggests this functionality would be implemented. The lower confidence is because there isn't a specific action or reducer case for editing todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos
  
  The answer includes a `removeTodo` action and corresponding reducer logic that filters out a todo by ID.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed
  
  The answer includes a `toggleTodo` action and corresponding reducer logic that toggles the completed status of a todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The answer mentions filters in the `FooterComponent`, and the architecture with NgRx selectors supports filtering functionality.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete
  
  While this specific action isn't explicitly defined, the NgRx structure would allow for this functionality to be implemented. The confidence is lower because there isn't a specific action for this feature.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos
  
  The answer includes a `clearCompletedTodos` action and corresponding reducer logic that filters out completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos
  
  The answer includes a `selectRemainingCount` selector that calculates the number of incomplete todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage
  
  The answer includes a `todoStorageService` with methods to get and put todos in localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization
  
  The answer includes an effect (`loadTodos$`) that loads todos from storage, and the `TodoListComponent` initializes with data from the store.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing
  
  The answer mentions converting the `todoEscape` directive to Angular, which suggests this functionality would be implemented. The confidence is slightly reduced because specific implementation details aren't provided.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo
  
  The answer mentions converting the `todoFocus` directive to Angular, which suggests this functionality would be implemented. The confidence is slightly reduced because specific implementation details aren't provided.

- **Pass** (70%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original
  
  The answer acknowledges the importance of maintaining the visual appearance, but doesn't provide specific CSS or styling details. The lower confidence reflects this lack of detailed styling information.

- **Pass** (70%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately
  
  While not explicitly addressed, the NgRx structure and component architecture would support this functionality. The lower confidence is due to the lack of explicit handling for this case.

- **Pass** (70%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter
  
  The answer mentions routing as a "Key Consideration" but doesn't provide specific implementation details for URL updates based on filters. The lower confidence reflects this lack of detailed implementation.
