# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
   The project setup explicitly indicates Angular 14.x with the "ng new" command and project naming.

2. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
   The Angular CLI-generated project by default uses ES modules.

3. **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
   The provided code includes NgRx store setup, reducers, and selectors.

4. **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
   An effects file (app.effects.ts) is provided with usage of createEffect and ofType.

5. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
   The answer defines actions, a reducer for todo manipulation, selectors for filtering state, and a basic effect.

6. **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
   The todo-storage.service.ts is decorated with @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }).

7. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
   The service utilizes localStorage via getItem and setItem methods.

8. **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
   The TodoListComponent is properly decorated with @Component along with its metadata.

9. **Fail** (80%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
   Although the response mentions converting AngularJS directives (such as todoFocus and todoEscape) to Angular directives, no actual sample code or @Directive usage is provided. This omission lowers confidence that directives have been properly implemented.

10. **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
    The provided HTML snippet uses *ngFor which verifies the use of Angular template syntax.

11. **Fail** (80%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
    There is no example in the provided code snippets showing event binding syntax like (click), causing uncertainty in verification.

12. **Fail** (80%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
    The answer does not include any examples of property binding; hence, this step fails due to lack of demonstration.

13. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
    The TodoListComponent implements ngOnInit as expected.

14. **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
    Interfaces for Todo and AppState are provided in the code.

15. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
    Constructor injection is clearly used in both the component and the service.

16. **Pass** (90%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
    The snippets are mostly compliant with Angular style guidelines; however, minor improvements (such as more explicit typing and better structure in effects) could be made.

17. **Fail** (80%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
    The effect implementation (using ofType with no specific action) and lack of event/property binding examples suggest that there could be runtime issues or warnings if the code were executed.

18. **Pass** (90%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
    While TypeScript interfaces are in place, some parts (e.g., the todos$ property in the component declared as any) could benefit from more precise typing.

19. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
    No TODO comments or commented-out code fragments are found in the provided snippets.

20. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design  
    The code is modularized into distinct components, services, and state management segments, suggesting adherence to the single responsibility principle.
