# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list  
   The answer includes a "TodoListComponent" with its associated template, which fulfills this requirement.

2. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos  
   The answer mentions a "TodoFormComponent" to handle adding todos, even though its code isn’t provided in full detail.

3. **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos  
   There is no dedicated component or code snippet provided that handles editing an existing todo. Only listing, adding, toggling, and deleting functionalities are shown.

4. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos  
   The answer includes a "FooterComponent" that is described as displaying both the todo count and filters.

5. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics  
   The "FooterComponent" is intended to handle the display of todo count statistics.

6. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos  
   The NgRx action "addTodo" is defined, and the intended "TodoFormComponent" is mentioned, indicating that functionality for adding todos is implemented.

7. **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos  
   There is no code or description showing the ability to modify an existing todo item (e.g., editing the title).

8. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos  
   The "removeTodo" action is defined in the NgRx actions, which confirms deletion functionality.

9. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed  
   The "toggleTodo" action is provided, which toggles a todo’s completed status.

10. **Fail** (90%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)  
    While filters are mentioned and a "FooterComponent" is noted, the provided code snippets do not explicitly show filtering logic (e.g., filtering the list based on status).  
    Explanation: The answer hints at the UI for filters but does not implement or demonstrate the behavior, so confidence is slightly reduced.

11. **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete  
    There is no implementation shown (e.g., a "mark all" feature) beyond toggling individual todos.

12. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos  
    The "clearCompletedTodos" action is clearly defined and implemented in the reducer.

13. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos  
    The selector "selectRemainingCount" is provided to compute and display the count of incomplete todos.

14. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage  
    The "todo-storage.service" implements persistence by using localStorage for saving todos.

15. **Fail** (90%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization  
    Although the "todo-storage.service" includes a "getTodos" method, the effect "loadTodos$" is not correctly implemented—it uses an empty ofType and returns a hardcoded empty todos array, so the integration for properly loading persisted todos is missing.  
    Explanation: There is an attempt, but it does not clearly initialize the state with stored todos.

16. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing  
    There is no implementation provided for handling the escape key press (e.g., through a directive using @HostListener).

17. **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo  
    The answer does not include any code or description showing autofocus or focus management for editing.

18. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original  
    No CSS or explicit instructions on preserving the original application's visual appearance are provided; thus, we cannot confirm visual parity.

19. **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately  
    There is no specific check or error handling for empty todo titles in the provided snippets.

20. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter  
    No routing configuration or URL update logic is provided; the answer only mentions that Angular’s router is different and requires configuration, without showing its implementation.
