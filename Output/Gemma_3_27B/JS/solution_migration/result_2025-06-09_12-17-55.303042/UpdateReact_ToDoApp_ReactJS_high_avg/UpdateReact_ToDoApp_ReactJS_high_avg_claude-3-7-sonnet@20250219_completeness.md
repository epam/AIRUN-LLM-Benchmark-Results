# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed

    The code includes a function called `handleNewTodoKeyDown` in the App component that checks for the Enter key press and creates a new todo when it's detected. The function is properly bound to the input field's onKeyDown event.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter

    The App component filters the todos based on the `nowShowing` state (all, active, completed) and renders them accordingly using the `shownTodos` variable. The filtering logic is correctly implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos

    The code includes a `toggleAllHandler` function in the App component that dispatches the `toggleAll` action. This functionality is connected to the toggle-all checkbox in the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted

    The TodoItem component receives handlers for toggling (`toggleHandler`), editing (`editHandler`), and deleting (`destroyHandler`) todos. These functions correctly dispatch the appropriate Redux actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode

    Although the exact event handler isn't shown in the TodoItem component code, the `onEdit` prop is passed to it, and the `editHandler` function in the App component sets the editing state to the todo ID when called.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo

    While the full TodoItem component code isn't provided, the architecture includes the necessary functionality with the `saveHandler` function that is passed to the TodoItem component. The Redux action `save` is implemented correctly.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value

    The architecture includes the `cancelHandler` function which calls `setEditing(null)` to exit edit mode. While the specific Escape key handling isn't shown in the TodoItem component code, the structure supports this functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items

    The App component calculates `activeTodoCount` and passes it to the TodoFooter component as the `count` prop, which would display the number of active items.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)

    The constants file is mentioned to include ALL_TODOS, ACTIVE_TODOS, and COMPLETED_TODOS, and the TodoFooter component receives the `nowShowing` prop which would be used to display the correct filter state.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos

    The TodoFooter component receives the `onClearCompleted` callback which dispatches the `clearCompleted` action. The implementation should include a button to call this function.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence

    The code explicitly mentions removing the localStorage persistence functionality: "Remove the `store` function (Redux handles state persistence)". However, there is no implementation of Redux persistence with solutions like redux-persist. The answer even acknowledges this as a "Next Step" rather than an implemented feature.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state

    The App component conditionally renders the main section and footer based on the existence of todos, and the TodoItem components are conditionally rendered based on filter criteria.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count

    The answer mentions keeping the pluralize utility function from the original code in utils.ts, suggesting this functionality is preserved, although the exact implementation isn't shown.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components

    The code is well-organized into smaller components (App, TodoItem, TodoFooter) with clear responsibilities and proper prop passing between them.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality

    The code organization follows good practices with separate files for components, types, Redux slice, constants, and utilities. The answer outlines a clear structure for the application.
