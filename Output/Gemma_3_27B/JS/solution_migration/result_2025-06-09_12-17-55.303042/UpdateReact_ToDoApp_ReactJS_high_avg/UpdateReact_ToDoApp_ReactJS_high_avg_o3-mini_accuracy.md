# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all React imports use React 18.x compatible syntax  
  The code uses “ReactDOM.createRoot” in the entry point (index.tsx), which is compliant with React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all components use functional component syntax with hooks instead of class components  
  All provided components, including App, use functional components along with hooks (e.g., useEffect, useDispatch, useSelector).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Redux Toolkit's createSlice is used for state management  
  The “todoSlice.ts” file clearly uses Redux Toolkit's createSlice to define reducers and actions.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for all props, state, and Redux store  
  The “types.ts” file defines interfaces for ITodo, ITodoState, and various component props.  
  Note: Although interfaces are defined for most components, some areas (e.g., additional components to be updated) may require further type annotations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses immutable state updates in reducers  
  The reducers in “todoSlice.ts” modify state directly; however, this is acceptable with Immer integration in Redux Toolkit which ensures immutability.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that nanoid is used for ID generation instead of custom UUID implementation  
  The “addTodo” reducer uses nanoid() for generating unique IDs.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the application uses React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate  
  There is no demonstration in the provided code of React.memo usage for any component.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that useCallback is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders  
  Event handlers in the App component (and the outlined components) are defined inline without wrapping them in useCallback.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that localStorage handling is implemented in a modern way  
  The guidance mentions local storage persistence (using redux-persist), but no actual code implementation for localStorage handling is provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows consistent naming conventions throughout the application  
  Naming of variables, components, and actions is consistent (e.g., todos, nowShowing, editing).

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that proper error handling is implemented where necessary  
  The code does not include try-catch blocks or any error boundary implementations for handling potential errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware  
  The store is set up using Redux Toolkit’s configureStore method, which applies the default middleware deemed appropriate.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that React.lazy is used for code splitting where appropriate  
  There is no evidence of React.lazy usage for code splitting in the provided entry point or component files.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the codebase has no TODOs remaining  
  The answer outlines remaining tasks and “brief outlines” for updating components, indicating that some TODO items still remain.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux Provider wraps the application entry point  
  The index.tsx file correctly wraps the App component with Redux’s Provider.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure strict TypeScript type checking is implemented throughout the application  
  While the codebase uses TypeScript and defines various interfaces, the provided information does not include tsconfig details. Nonetheless, the use of TypeScript throughout the code indicates an effort toward strict type checking.
