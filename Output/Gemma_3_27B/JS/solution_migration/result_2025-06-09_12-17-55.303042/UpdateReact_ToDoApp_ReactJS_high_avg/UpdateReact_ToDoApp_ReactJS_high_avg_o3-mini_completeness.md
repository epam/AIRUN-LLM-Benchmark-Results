# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The App component registers a keydown event on the input field that checks for the ENTER key (via ENTER_KEY) and dispatches the addTodo action if the input is not empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The code filters the todos based on the nowShowing value (using ACTIVE_TODOS, COMPLETED_TODOS, etc.) and renders the resulting list accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  There is an input checkbox with an onChange handler (toggleAllHandler) that dispatches the toggleAll action to update all todosâ€™ completion states.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  Each TodoItem is rendered with onToggle, onDestroy, and onEdit callbacks. Although the internal implementation of TodoItem is not fully shown, the provided wiring suggests that individual toggling, editing, and deletion are supported.  
  (Note: Confidence is 90% because we assume that the TodoItem component properly uses these props as intended.)

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  There is an onEdit prop provided to TodoItem; however, the code snippet does not demonstrate the binding of a double-click event to trigger editing mode. The expected double-click behavior is not explicitly implemented in the provided sections.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  While an onSave prop is passed to TodoItem, there is no evidence in the provided code that the edited todo is submitted upon pressing Enter. The submission mechanism for an edited todo is missing.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  Although a cancelHandler function is provided (dispatching setEditing(null)), the code does not include an event handler that listens for the Escape key during editing. Therefore, the behavior expected for the Escape key is not implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  The App calculates activeTodoCount and passes it to TodoFooter, ensuring that the count of active (non-completed) items is properly displayed.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The nowShowing state is managed and passed to TodoFooter. While the detailed filter UI (e.g., clickable filter buttons) is not shown in the snippet, the structure suggests that filter functionality is planned.  
  (Note: Confidence is 90% because the actual UI for changing filters is not fully detailed.)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  A clearCompletedHandler is defined and passed to TodoFooter, indicating that the feature to clear completed todos is present.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  The code explicitly mentions that Redux now handles state management and suggests using redux-persist as a next step, but localStorage persistence is not implemented in the provided snippet.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  The rendering of the main section and footer is conditional (e.g., main is rendered only if todos exist, and footer is rendered only if there are active or completed todos).

- **Fail** (80%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  Although the outline mentions a pluralize utility in the next steps, the provided code does not show any implementation that performs pluralization for the item count.  
  (Note: Confidence is 80% because the pluralization might be handled in an unseen utility, but it is not present in the code snippet.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The code is divided among several components (App, TodoItem, TodoFooter, etc.), promoting separation of concerns and maintainability.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The project is organized into separate files (package.json, types.ts, todoSlice.ts, app.tsx, store.ts, etc.) in a manner that supports a modular structure.
