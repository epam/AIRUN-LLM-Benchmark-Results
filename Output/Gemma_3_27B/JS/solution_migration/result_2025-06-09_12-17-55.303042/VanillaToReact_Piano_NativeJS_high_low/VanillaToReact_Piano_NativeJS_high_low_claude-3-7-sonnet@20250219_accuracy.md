# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration
  
  The code includes the explicit use of Create React App with TypeScript template as shown in the setup instructions:
  ```bash
  npx create-react-app virtual-piano --template typescript
  ```
  The code also uses React 18 features and TypeScript throughout.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure
  
  TypeScript interfaces are properly defined in a separate `types.ts` file:
  ```typescript
  export interface NoteData {
    letter: string;
    note: string;
  }

  export interface SoundMap {
    [key: string]: HTMLAudioElement;
  }
  ```
  These interfaces are properly imported and used throughout the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks
  
  All components (`App`, `Piano`, `ButtonContainer`) are implemented as functional components using React hooks like `useState` and `useRef`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)
  
  The code properly uses React hooks for state management:
  - `useState` for managing letter mode: `const [isLettersMode, setIsLettersMode] = useState(false);`
  - `useState` for fullscreen state: `const [fullscreen, setFullscreen] = useState(false);`
  - `useState` for active keys: `const [activeKeys, setActiveKeys] = useState<string[]>([]);`

- **Fail** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels
  
  The `Piano` component defines `handleKeyDown` and `handleKeyUp` functions but doesn't actually attach them to any event listeners. The code is missing the necessary `useEffect` to set up the keyboard event listeners:

  ```typescript
  useEffect(() => {
    window.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
    window.addEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp);
    
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
      window.removeEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp);
    };
  }, []);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup) are implemented using React synthetic events
  
  The `Piano` component correctly implements mouse interactions using React synthetic events:
  ```typescript
  onMouseDown={() => handleMouseDown(keyData.note)}
  onMouseUp={() => handleMouseUp(keyData.note)}
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment
  
  Audio resources are properly initialized in the `App` component using the `Audio` constructor and organized in a `soundMapper` object that follows the defined TypeScript interface.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility
  
  The fullscreen functionality is implemented in the `handleFullscreen` function with proper document API calls and state management:
  ```typescript
  const handleFullscreen = () => {
    if (!document.fullscreenElement) {
      document.documentElement.requestFullscreen();
      setFullscreen(true);
    } else {
      document.exitFullscreen();
      setFullscreen(false);
    }
  };
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns
  
  The code correctly implements conditional class application using template literals and ternary operators:
  ```typescript
  className={`piano ${isLettersMode ? 'letters' : ''}`}
  className={`piano-key ${keyData.note.includes('â™¯') ? 'sharp' : ''} ${activeKeys.includes(keyData.note) ? 'piano-key-active' : ''}`}
  className={`btn btn-notes ${!isLettersMode ? 'btn-active' : ''}`}
  ```

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate
  
  Despite mentioning in the explanation that "the component structure allows for potential optimizations like `React.memo` if needed," the actual implementation doesn't use `React.memo` for any component. For components that rely solely on props and don't have internal state changes, like `ButtonContainer`, using `React.memo` would be appropriate.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations
  
  The audio playback implementation has two issues:
  1. The `stopNote` function doesn't actually stop the audio - it only removes the note from the active keys array but doesn't call `sound.pause()` or similar methods.
  2. There's no cleanup for audio elements when components unmount, which could lead to memory leaks.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application
  
  The code generally follows TypeScript strict typing with properly defined interfaces and type annotations. However, the `handleKeyDown` and `handleKeyUp` functions in the `Piano` component should include the dependency array for the `useEffect` hook to prevent potential issues with closures, and there are a few places where explicit return types could be added for function declarations.
