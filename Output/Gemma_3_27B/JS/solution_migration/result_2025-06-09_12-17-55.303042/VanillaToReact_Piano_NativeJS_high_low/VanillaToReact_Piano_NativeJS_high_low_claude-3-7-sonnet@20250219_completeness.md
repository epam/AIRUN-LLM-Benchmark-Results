# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'
  
  The code clearly includes a header element with an h1 tag containing "Virtual Piano" in the App.tsx component:
  ```tsx
  <header className="header">
    <h1 className="header-title">Virtual Piano</h1>
  </header>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons
  
  The ButtonContainer component includes both 'Notes' and 'Letters' buttons with proper toggle functionality:
  ```tsx
  <button className={`btn btn-notes ${!isLettersMode ? 'btn-active' : ''}`} onClick={() => onModeChange(false)}>
    Notes
  </button>
  <button className={`btn btn-letters ${isLettersMode ? 'btn-active' : ''}`} onClick={() => onModeChange(true)}>
    Letters
  </button>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)
  
  The Piano component renders all the piano keys, including both natural and sharp keys, based on the pianoKeysData array:
  ```tsx
  {pianoKeysData.map((keyData, index) => (
    <div
      key={index}
      className={`piano-key ${keyData.note.includes('♯') ? 'sharp' : ''} ${activeKeys.includes(keyData.note) ? 'piano-key-active' : ''}`}
      data-letter={keyData.letter}
      data-note={keyData.note}
      onMouseDown={() => handleMouseDown(keyData.note)}
      onMouseUp={() => handleMouseUp(keyData.note)}
    ></div>
  ))}
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes
  
  Each piano key div element includes data-letter and data-note attributes:
  ```tsx
  data-letter={keyData.letter}
  data-note={keyData.note}
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked
  
  The Piano component includes the necessary functionality to play the correct audio when keys are clicked through the handleMouseDown and playNote functions:
  ```tsx
  const playNote = (note: string) => {
    if (!soundMapper[note] || activeKeys.includes(note)) return;

    const sound = soundMapper[note];
    sound.currentTime = 0;
    sound.play();
    setActiveKeys([...activeKeys, note]);
  };
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)
  
  The application adds the 'piano-key-active' class to keys when they are pressed:
  ```tsx
  className={`piano-key ${keyData.note.includes('♯') ? 'sharp' : ''} ${activeKeys.includes(keyData.note) ? 'piano-key-active' : ''}`}
  ```

- **Fail** (90%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes
  
  The Piano component defines handleKeyDown and handleKeyUp functions, but these aren't being connected to any event listeners. The code is missing the useEffect hook to add these event listeners to the document or piano element:
  ```tsx
  useEffect(() => {
    document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
    document.addEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp);
    
    return () => {
      document.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
      document.removeEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp);
    };
  }, []);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked
  
  The App component has state for isLettersMode and passes it to both the ButtonContainer (for button styling) and Piano components:
  ```tsx
  const [isLettersMode, setIsLettersMode] = useState(false);
  
  const handleModeChange = (isLetters: boolean) => {
    setIsLettersMode(isLetters);
  };
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes
  
  The fullscreen functionality is implemented in the handleFullscreen function:
  ```tsx
  const handleFullscreen = () => {
    if (!document.fullscreenElement) {
      document.documentElement.requestFullscreen();
      setFullscreen(true);
    } else {
      document.exitFullscreen();
      setFullscreen(false);
    }
  };
  ```

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly
  
  The application tracks active keys using the activeKeys state array, which allows for tracking multiple pressed keys simultaneously. However, there might be an issue with the implementation of keyboard handling (missing event listeners as noted above).

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys
  
  The provided code only implements mouseDown and mouseUp handlers, but there is no implementation for handling mouse drag across piano keys. To properly implement this functionality, the code would need to include mouseOver or mouseEnter handlers that check if a mouse button is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information
  
  The App component includes a footer with the year "2020":
  ```tsx
  <footer className="footer">
    <div className="footer-container">2020</div>
  </footer>
  ```
