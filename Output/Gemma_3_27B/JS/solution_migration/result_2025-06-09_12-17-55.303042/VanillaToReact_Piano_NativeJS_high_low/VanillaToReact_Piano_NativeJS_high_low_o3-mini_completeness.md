# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'  
  The App component includes a header with a <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element that displays “Virtual Piano”.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons  
  The ButtonContainer component renders two buttons labeled “Notes” and “Letters”, and toggling between them updates the application state accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)  
  The Piano component maps over a predefined list of 12 keys (including both natural and sharp notes), rendering a corresponding DOM element for each.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes  
  Each piano key element includes <code>data-letter</code> and <code>data-note</code> attributes, correctly reflecting its key information.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked  
  The code calls <code>playNote</code> on mouse down, which uses the <code>soundMapper</code> to play the corresponding sound. The logic is correct, though confidence is 95% because external asset loading (e.g., file paths) might require adjustments in a real deployment.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)  
  When a key is played, its note is added to the <code>activeKeys</code> state, which in turn adds the CSS class <code>piano-key-active</code> to visually highlight it.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes  
  While functions <code>handleKeyDown</code> and <code>handleKeyUp</code> are defined in the Piano component, they are never attached to any event listener (for example, via a <code>useEffect</code> hook on <code>window</code> or the piano element). As a result, keyboard events will not be handled.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked  
  The <code>isLettersMode</code> state is appropriately toggled via the ButtonContainer component, and the piano’s CSS classes change accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes  
  The fullscreen toggle button calls a function that uses <code>document.documentElement.requestFullscreen()</code> and <code>document.exitFullscreen()</code>, correctly managing the fullscreen state.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly  
  The logic for tracking active keys using the <code>activeKeys</code> state supports individual note activation. However, since the keyboard event listeners are not properly attached and there is no additional handling (or debouncing) for multiple keys pressed together, the implementation does not confidently support simultaneous key presses. (Confidence reduced to 90% due to potential partial handling for mouse events only.)

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys  
  The code only implements <code>onMouseDown</code> and <code>onMouseUp</code> for each key. There is no implementation to handle mouse drag (e.g., handling <code>onMouseEnter</code> while the mouse button is held down), so dragging over keys will not trigger audio playback as intended.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information  
  The App component’s footer includes a container displaying “2020”, fulfilling the requirement for a footer with year information.
