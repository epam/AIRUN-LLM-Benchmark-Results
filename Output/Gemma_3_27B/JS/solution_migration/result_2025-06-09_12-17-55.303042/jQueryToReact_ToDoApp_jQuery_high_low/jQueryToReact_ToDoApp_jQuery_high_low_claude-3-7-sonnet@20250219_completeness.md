# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos
  
  The code includes a Header component that would contain the title and input field for creating new todos. The structure is established in App.tsx which includes the Header component.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos
  
  The application includes a main section with a TodoList component that would display the list of todos. However, while the code structure indicates the main section is present, the toggle-all checkbox implementation is only implied in the Redux actions (toggleAll) but not explicitly shown in the component code snippets.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button
  
  The TodoItem component clearly includes all three required elements: a toggle checkbox (input.toggle), a title display (label with todo.title), and a delete button (button.destroy).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode
  
  The TodoItem component includes a double-click handler (onDoubleClick={handleEditClick}) on the label that sets the editing state to true, which then renders the edit input field.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The application includes filtering functionality through the Redux state with 'all', 'active', and 'completed' filter options. The TodoList component applies these filters to determine which todos to display.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization
  
  While the Footer component is mentioned and imported in App.tsx, the specific implementation showing the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization is not explicitly shown in the code snippets. However, the Redux state structure would support this functionality.

- **Pass** (80%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter
  
  The application has a filter state in Redux that would be used to highlight the current selected filter. While the Footer component is mentioned, its specific implementation showing filter links is not explicitly shown in the code snippets.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist
  
  The Redux actions include a 'clearCompleted' action which would be used by a button in the Footer component. While the Footer component is mentioned, its specific implementation showing the 'Clear completed' button is not explicitly shown.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter
  
  The Redux setup includes an 'addTodo' action that would be dispatched when a user types and presses Enter in the input field. The TodoState interface and Redux slice support this functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos
  
  The TodoItem component includes a toggle checkbox with an onChange handler that dispatches the toggleTodo action, allowing users to toggle the completion status of individual todos.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once
  
  The Redux actions include a 'toggleAll' action that would toggle the completion status of all todos. While the component implementation for this is not explicitly shown, the Redux functionality is in place.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management
  
  The TodoItem component includes an edit input field that appears when editing is true, with autoFocus attribute and proper keyboard event handlers for Enter and Escape keys, as well as blur handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos
  
  The TodoItem component includes a destroy button with an onClick handler that dispatches the removeTodo action, allowing users to delete individual todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos
  
  The Redux actions include a 'clearCompleted' action that would remove all completed todos when triggered.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status
  
  The TodoList component includes logic to filter todos based on the current filter state (all, active, completed), ensuring only the appropriate todos are displayed.
