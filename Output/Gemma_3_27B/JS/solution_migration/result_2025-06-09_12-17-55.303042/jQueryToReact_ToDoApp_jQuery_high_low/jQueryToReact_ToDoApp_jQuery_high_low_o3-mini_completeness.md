# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass** (90%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos  
   Although the provided answer does not include the concrete implementation code for the Header component, it is referenced in the component structure (e.g. in App.tsx). This implies the header is expected to exist. However, because the actual code is not shown, the evaluation is not 100% certain.

2. **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos  
   The provided code shows that the main section renders the TodoList component; however, there is no visible implementation of a toggle-all checkbox within the main section or any other component, so this requirement is not met.

3. **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button  
   In the TodoItem component, there is an input of type checkbox (for toggling), a label (for displaying the title), and a button with the "destroy" class (for deletion). This meets the evaluation step requirements.

4. **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode  
   The TodoItem component attaches an onDoubleClick handler to the label (handleEditClick), which sets the editing state to true. This enables editing mode as required.

5. **Pass** (90%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
   The TodoList component uses a filter state (sourced from Redux via selectFilter) to filter todos based on their status. Even though the actual UI for selecting filters (e.g. clickable filter links) is not shown in detail, the core logic for filtering exists. The slight deduction is due to the missing explicit UI code.

6. **Fail** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization  
   The provided answer mentions a Footer component in the project structure, but it does not supply any code for it. Thus, we cannot confirm that the footer displays the remaining todos count or handles pluralization correctly.

7. **Fail** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter  
   As with the previous step, although a Footer component is mentioned, the code for rendering filter links is not provided. Therefore, there is no evidence of the UI behavior to highlight the current filter.

8. **Fail** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist  
   The answer describes the existence of a clearCompleted reducer in the Redux slice, but no UI code in the Footer component shows a button for this purpose. This requirement is not met in the provided code samples.

9. **Fail** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter  
   The logic for adding a todo is implemented in the todoSlice (via addTodo), and the Header component is listed in the component structure. However, no implementation details of the Header component or its event handler (e.g. handling Enter key press) are provided, so we cannot confirm that new todos are created via an input field.

10. **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos  
    The TodoItem componentâ€™s checkbox is connected to toggleTodo, which flips the completion status of the corresponding todo. This meets the requirement.

11. **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once  
    The todoSlice includes a reducer named toggleAll; however, the UI does not demonstrate any control (such as a checkbox or button) that uses this functionality, so the feature is not shown in the provided code.

12. **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management  
    The TodoItem component implements editing mode with an input element that uses the autoFocus property. This ensures that when editing is activated (via double-click), focus is properly set to the input field.

13. **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos  
    The TodoItem component includes a delete button (with the onClick handler calling removeTodo) which correctly enables deletion of a todo.

14. **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos  
    Although the Redux slice provides a clearCompleted reducer, there is no UI element (such as a button in the Footer) provided in the answer that invokes this functionality.

15. **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status  
    The TodoList component applies filtering based on the current filter value (active, completed, or all) to decide which todos to display, which indicates that the filtering logic works as intended.
