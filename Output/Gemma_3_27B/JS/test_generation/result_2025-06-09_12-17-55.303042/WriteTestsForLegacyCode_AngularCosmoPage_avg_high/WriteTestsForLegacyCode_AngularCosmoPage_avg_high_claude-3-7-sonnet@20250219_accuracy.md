# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)
  
  The answer explicitly mentions using Jasmine as the testing framework and Karma as the test runner, which are appropriate choices for AngularJS testing. The code examples demonstrate Jasmine syntax with `describe`, `it`, and `expect` statements.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints
  
  The answer shows proper mocking of $resource-based services. In the example tests, REST services are mocked using `jasmine.createSpyObj` with appropriate methods like 'save', 'update', 'delete', 'query', etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation
  
  The test examples consistently use `beforeEach` hooks to set up the test environment, including module loading and dependency injection. Though `afterEach` is mentioned in the explanation, it's not shown in the examples, but the overall approach to test isolation is correct.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls
  
  The answer demonstrates proper mocking of HTTP requests by mocking the REST service and its methods. For example: `REST.content.save.and.returnValue(Promise.resolve({ id: 123 }))` prevents real API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection
  
  The examples show proper AngularJS dependency injection in the `beforeEach` blocks, using the underscore notation (e.g., `_$scope_`) for injecting services and then assigning them to local variables.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations
  
  The examples demonstrate proper handling of promises in tests by using `Promise.resolve()` and `Promise.reject()` to mock asynchronous operations, which is appropriate for AngularJS testing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies
  
  The answer shows proper use of Jasmine spies with `jasmine.createSpyObj` for mocking services and `spyOn` for monitoring function calls, such as `spyOn($scope, 'updatePageType')`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization
  
  All examples follow the `describe`/`it` pattern consistently, with descriptive test names that explain what is being tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls
  
  The examples include tests for both success scenarios (`REST.content.save.and.returnValue(Promise.resolve({ id: 123 }))`) and error scenarios (`REST.content.save.and.returnValue(Promise.reject('Error saving page'))`).

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate
  
  The tests show simulation of some interactions like changing values (`$scope.page.type = 'newType'`), but direct simulation of DOM events or user interactions (like clicks) is not explicitly shown. However, this is often handled at a higher level in AngularJS testing.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage
  
  While the answer mentions using `afterEach` for cleanup in the explanation, it's not explicitly shown in the examples. However, the overall approach with isolated test setup in `beforeEach` blocks indicates proper understanding of test isolation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested
  
  All test cases use descriptive names that clearly explain what functionality is being tested, such as "should initialize the page object correctly" and "should handle errors when saving the page".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible
  
  The tests appropriately focus on validating outputs and behaviors rather than implementation details. For example, after calling `$scope.savePage()`, the test verifies that `REST.content.save` was called, which is the expected behavior.
