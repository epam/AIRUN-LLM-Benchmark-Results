# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)  
  The answer uses Jasmine for writing the tests and Karma for running them, which are both modern and widely used in AngularJS testing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints  
  The tests create spy objects for various REST endpoints (e.g., REST.content, REST.contentRevisions, etc.) and verify that these mocks are used when calling API endpoints.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation  
  The test files consistently use beforeEach to set up the AngularJS module, inject dependencies, and create spy objects, ensuring that each test starts with a clean state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls  
  Since the tests rely on spies (e.g., jasmine.createSpyObj) for the REST services, there is no actual HTTP request made, ensuring isolation from real API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection  
  Dependencies such as $scope, $rootScope, REST, $location, Page, and others are injected using AngularJS's dependency injection mechanism.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations  
  The tests use Promise.resolve and Promise.reject to simulate asynchronous operations. However, they do not explicitly flush pending promises (e.g., via $scope.$apply or using done callbacks). This could lead to tests missing asynchronous callback effects in some cases.  
  (I am 90% confident in this evaluation because while the basic promise structure is present, the tests might not fully handle asynchronous resolution.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies  
  The answer demonstrates the correct creation and use of spies (e.g., with jasmine.createSpyObj and spyOn) to mock external dependencies, ensuring test isolation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization  
  All test files consistently use the describe/it structure for organizing tests, which enhances readability and maintainability.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls  
  The tests include scenarios for successful API calls (e.g., resolving promises in savePage) as well as error scenarios (e.g., rejecting promises and handling error responses).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate  
  The tests simulate changes to $scope properties (such as setting the scheduleDate, modifying the page type, or deleting a page) which mimic user interactions with the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage  
  While there is no explicit afterEach cleanup in the provided examples, the use of AngularJSâ€™s testing module and beforeEach setup typically ensures state is properly isolated between tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested  
  The test case names (e.g., "should initialize the page object correctly", "should call updatePageType when the page type changes") are clear and descriptive, making it straightforward to understand what each test validates.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible  
  The tests assert on the outcomes such as object properties, function calls, and navigation paths rather than internal implementation, ensuring they verify observed behavior.
