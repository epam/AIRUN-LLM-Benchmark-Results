# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources  
  Although the answer includes tests for the REST factory (e.g., tests for "blocks" and "blocksRequirements"), it only provides samples and leaves a note to “Add tests for all other resources”. This incomplete coverage does not satisfy the requirement for covering all defined resources.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly  
  The provided Page factory test only checks a couple of properties (id and title) and contains a comment to “Add assertions for all other properties.” It does not fully verify that all properties initialize as expected.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly  
  There are no tests provided for the Users factory. Therefore, this step is not met.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods  
  The tests for pageCtrl cover only a subset of public methods (e.g., initialization, updatePageType, savePage, and deletePage). Several other public methods (such as titleChange, descriptionChange, urlChange, etc.) are mentioned but not covered by tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller  
  A test exists that verifies the initialization of the page object by comparing properties (id and title) from the controller with those of the Page factory.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation  
  There is no test provided that checks whether the titleChange function automatically generates a URL.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction  
  The answer does not include any tests for a saveLocal function or interactions with localStorage.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality  
  There is no test for the autocompleteTags function or its associated tag suggestion behavior.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)  
  While the tests for savePage simulate a successful save and an error during page saving, they do not cover other conditional branches such as handling duplicate pages or update scenarios.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types  
  No tests have been provided for handling edge cases, such as empty URL strings or undefined/invalid page types.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly  
  The tests for page deletion check that the deletion function is called on multiple REST endpoints and that the location is updated appropriately after deletion.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions  
  There is no evidence of tests covering the handling of page versions or any interactions with localStorage besides the minimal scheduling test.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components  
  Although the answer mentions a goal of 80% coverage, the provided tests are only partial (with many “Add tests…” notes) and do not comprehensively test all components.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling  
  There are no tests provided that check for proper event broadcasting or event handling within the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality  
  One test explicitly checks that when a page is new (with scheduleDate set to null), the schedule date is correctly initialized.
