# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering
- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos
- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos
  
  The provided tests for app.tsx do not include specific tests for filtering todos (switching between ALL_TODOS, ACTIVE_TODOS, and COMPLETED_TODOS views). While the test does verify that the app initializes with ALL_TODOS showing, it does not test the filtering functionality between different todo states.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
  
  The app.tsx test file does not include tests for the clearCompleted functionality, which is an important feature of the todo app.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events
- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts
- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation
- **Fail** (90%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
  
  While the footer.tsx test file verifies that the "Clear completed" button renders when there are completed todos, it does not test the actual functionality of clicking the button and calling the onClearCompleted function.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos
- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions
  
  The todoModel.test.ts file does not include tests for the subscribe and inform functions, which are essential for the event-driven architecture of the application.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
  
  The todoModel.test.ts file does not include tests for the clearCompleted functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx
- **Fail** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data
  
  The tests do not include dedicated test fixtures for sample todo data. While some tests create todo objects inline, having reusable fixtures would improve test maintainability.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented
  
  The test suite does not include specific tests for routing functionality, which would be important for testing navigation between different todo filters (all, active, completed).
