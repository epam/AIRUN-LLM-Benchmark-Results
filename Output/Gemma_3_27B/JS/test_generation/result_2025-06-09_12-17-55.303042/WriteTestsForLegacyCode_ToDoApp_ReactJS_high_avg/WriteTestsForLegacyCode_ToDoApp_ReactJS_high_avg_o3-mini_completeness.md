# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering  
  The app.test.tsx file includes a test ("renders without crashing") that confirms the component is rendered.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos  
  The app.test.tsx file contains a test ("adds a todo when Enter is pressed with text") that validates the addition of a new todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos  
  There is a test ("toggles all todos") in app.test.tsx that checks if the toggle-all functionality is called as expected.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos  
  The provided app.test.tsx file tests for the presence of ALL_TODOS but does not include tests that simulate filtering (e.g. switching to active or completed views).

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The app.test.tsx file does not include any tests that trigger or verify the clearing of completed todos; this functionality seems to be indirectly tested elsewhere (in footer.test.tsx), but not directly in app.test.tsx as required.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering  
  The todoItem.test.tsx file includes a test ("renders without crashing") confirming the component renders successfully.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos  
  While the file tests toggling (via checkbox) and editing (double-click and keyboard events), it does not explicitly test the destruction (onDestroy) of a todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events  
  The tests for "handles edit submission with ENTER key" and "handles edit cancellation with ESCAPE key" confirm that keyboard events are properly handled.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts  
  The footer.test.tsx file tests rendering with a preset count (2 items) but does not cover multiple scenarios or different counts to fully verify dynamic rendering.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation  
  The test only checks for the existence of an "All" link. There is no simulation or verification of navigation to other filters (active/completed).

- **Pass** (90%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The test checks for the presence of the "Clear completed" button when there are completed todos. Although it doesn’t simulate clicking the button to trigger the clear functionality, it does verify that the control is rendered.  
  Explanation: Confidence is 90% because while the element is rendered, the action on click isn’t explicitly verified.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos  
  The todoModel.test.ts file tests adding, toggling (both all and individual todos), and destroying todos, but it does not include any test for saving a todo.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions  
  There is no test for the subscribe functionality (or how changes are communicated/informed) in the provided todoModel.test.ts file.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The test file does not include any test to verify the clearing of completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation  
  The utils.test.ts file includes a test to check that the uuid function returns a string with expected format.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality  
  There is a test verifying that pluralize returns "item" for a count of 1 and "items" for a count of 2.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations  
  The tests simulate storing and then retrieving data using the store function, confirming the functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function  
  The extend function is tested by merging two objects and confirming the result is as expected.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx  
  While several test files follow the .test.tsx convention (app.test.tsx, todoItem.test.tsx, footer.test.tsx), other files such as utils.test.ts and constants.test.ts do not use the .tsx extension. This inconsistency in naming conventions results in a failure according to the specified criteria.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data  
  Sample todo fixture data is provided in todoItem.test.tsx and used where necessary in other tests.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented  
  There are no tests addressing routing functionality or utilizing mocks for routing, which is missing from the provided test suite.
