# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API

    The code has inconsistencies in how it fetches and handles character data. In `App.tsx`, it uses direct `setCharacters` and `setError` calls which are not defined in the component. However, in `charactersSlice.ts`, it properly defines a Redux thunk for fetching characters. The App component doesn't dispatch this thunk action, creating a disconnect between the Redux state and the component's behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls

    The application includes a `LoadingIndicator` component that is conditionally rendered based on the `isLoading` state from Redux: `{isLoading && <LoadingIndicator />}`.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI

    The application attempts to display characters with `characters.map((character) => ...)`, but due to the disconnect between the Redux state and the component, the characters wouldn't be properly loaded or displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields

    The provided code doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields as required.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name

    The character name is displayed in each list item: `<ListItem key={character.url}>{character.name}</ListItem>`.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App

    The code includes React scripts in the package.json which suggests it uses Create React App, but there's no explicit indication or configuration specific to CRA. However, the structure and dependencies align with a typical CRA project.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states

    While the Redux slice correctly defines states for loading, error, and characters, the App component has a critical disconnect. It tries to call undefined `setCharacters` and `setError` functions instead of dispatching Redux actions. The `useSelector` hooks are used to access Redux state, but there's no corresponding `useDispatch` to update the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering

    The code correctly assigns unique keys to each list item using the character's URL: `<ListItem key={character.url}>`.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately

    The application does not have explicit handling for empty data states. While it handles loading and error states, there's no specific UI or message for when characters data is empty but not in an error state.
