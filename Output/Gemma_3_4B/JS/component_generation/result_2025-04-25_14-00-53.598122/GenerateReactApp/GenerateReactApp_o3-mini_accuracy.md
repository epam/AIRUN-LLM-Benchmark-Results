# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses React 18.x or newer by checking the package.json dependencies  
  The package.json lists "react": "^18.2.0" and "react-dom": "^18.2.0", which clearly indicates React 18 is being used.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that TypeScript is properly implemented with appropriate type definitions for all components, props, and states  
  Although the files use TypeScript (with extensions like .tsx) and include some type annotations (e.g., for Axios responses), the code lacks comprehensive type definitions in several areas. For example, the useSelector hooks are used without providing a type for the state, and functions to update the state (setCharacters, setError) are called without being defined or properly connected via dispatch or local state. This reduces the benefits of TypeScript’s strict typing. (I am 90% confident because while TypeScript is in use, its implementation is incomplete.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Axios is used for API requests to fetch data from the Star Wars API endpoint  
  Axios is imported and used in both App.tsx and charactersSlice.ts to perform API calls to the specified SWAPI endpoint.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure that the application handles API errors gracefully with appropriate error states or messages  
  In the App.tsx file, a try...catch block is used to handle errors and display an error message. However, within the try block the functions setCharacters and setError are called even though they are not defined, which would likely cause runtime errors. Hence, error handling is attempted, but its implementation is flawed. (I am 90% confident due to the misuse of undefined functions.)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the character data is fetched on component mount using useEffect hook  
  The code makes use of the useEffect hook to trigger the API call on component mount.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application properly manages component rendering optimization  
  The character list is rendered by mapping over the characters array and each list item uses a unique key from character.url. This approach aligns with React’s optimization practices for lists.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the code follows React best practices using hooks appropriately  
  While hooks such as useEffect and useSelector are used, the code improperly calls functions like setCharacters and setError without defining or retrieving them (likely via useDispatch or local state hooks). This deviates from best practices in hook usage and state management within React.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't contain any TODO comments or unnecessary code  
  The provided code does not include any TODO comments or obviously unnecessary code fragments.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the codebase has minimal comments that only clarify complex logic when necessary  
  The comments and explanations are concise and primarily serve to clarify complex or important sections of the code, keeping the codebase clean.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the API endpoint 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' is being called correctly  
  The API endpoint is correctly defined in App.tsx as well as used in charactersSlice.ts. Although there is an additional proxy configuration in setupProxy.js, the endpoint itself is accurate.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application renders without console errors or warnings  
  Due to the use of undefined functions (setCharacters and setError) in the App.tsx component, the application is likely to cause runtime errors that would result in console errors or warnings.
