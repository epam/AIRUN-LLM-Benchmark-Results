# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  Although the code attempts to fetch characters from the SWAPI endpoint and renders a list using the <List> and <ListItem> components, the useEffect callback incorrectly calls undefined functions (setCharacters and setError) instead of using proper Redux dispatch or local state setters. As a result, the fetched data is never properly stored and rendered.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The code includes the <LoadingIndicator> component which is conditionally rendered when isLoading is true. However, since the state management has issues (see other steps), the indicator may not be triggered as expected. The structure is present, so the intent is correct, but due to integration issues, there’s a slight concern regarding its actual behavior.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  Because the fetched character data is never stored (due to the undefined setCharacters function instead of dispatching an action to update the Redux store), the list rendering logic relying on characters from Redux does not receive any data. Therefore, characters will not be displayed in the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  The provided code does not include any search or additional input fields; it strictly focuses on fetching and displaying character data, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Within the <List>, each character is rendered using <ListItem key={character.url}>{character.name}</ListItem>. Both the character’s name and a unique key (using the URL) are appropriately used for display and optimal rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The presence of react-scripts in the scripts section of package.json and the typical Create React App file structure confirm that the application was set up using Create React App.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  Although a Redux slice (charactersSlice) has been defined to manage loading, error, and character data states, the App component does not dispatch any actions (e.g., fetchCharacters) from the slice. Instead, it incorrectly attempts to update the state using undefined functions (setCharacters, setError). This mismanagement results in improper state handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  The code uses character.url as the key for each list item, ensuring that each element in the list has a unique key, which is optimal for React rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  In the current implementation, if the characters array is empty, the UI simply renders an empty list. Although there’s no explicit “No data” message displayed, rendering an empty list is an acceptable way of handling an empty state in many applications.
