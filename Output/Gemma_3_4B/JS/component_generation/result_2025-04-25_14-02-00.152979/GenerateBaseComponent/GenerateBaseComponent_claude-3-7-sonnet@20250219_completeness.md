# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element
- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown

    The provided code doesn't include a dedicated search input field within the dropdown. While the component tracks a `searchTerm` state variable, there is no actual `<input>` element where users can type their search query. The filtering logic exists, but the UI element for user input is missing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown
- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys

    The component doesn't implement keyboard arrow key navigation. There are handlers for Enter and Escape keys, but no code to handle the arrow up/down keys for navigating through dropdown options.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key

    While there is an `onKeyDown` handler for the Enter key in the list items, the implementation appears incorrect. The handler is attached to the list items themselves, but they would need to be focusable (with tabIndex) to receive keyboard events. Additionally, there's no mechanism to move focus between items, so a user couldn't effectively use Enter to select an item.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused
- **Fail** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes

    There is no code that explicitly returns focus to the select component when the dropdown closes. When `setIsOpen(false)` is called, there is no corresponding focus management.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click
- **Fail** (80%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard

    The code attempts to handle this with the `onKeyDown` event on list items checking for Enter key, but as mentioned earlier, without proper focus management and tabIndex attributes, this functionality won't work properly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed
- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component

    The implementation for handling clicks outside the component is incorrect. The current implementation has a `handleDropdownClick` function attached to the select container itself, not to document or a wrapper element that would detect clicks outside. Additionally, it immediately closes the dropdown when clicked, which would prevent the dropdown from opening in the first place.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused
