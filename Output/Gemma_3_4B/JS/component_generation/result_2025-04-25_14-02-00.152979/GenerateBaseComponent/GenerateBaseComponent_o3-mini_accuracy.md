# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  The package.json specifies "react": "^18.2.0", and the component imports React from 'react', confirming React 18.x is in use.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  The code uses TypeScript (.tsx files) and defines proper types (e.g., the SearchableSelectProps interface) ensuring type safety.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  There is an import of './index.css' in the component, and a corresponding CSS file is provided in the project structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  The code is clear, concise, and free of comments indicating unfinished work or potential issues.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  The component manages state using useState for searchTerm, isOpen, and selectedOption, and uses useEffect appropriately, ensuring clean state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  The component accepts customizable props such as options, onChange, placeholder, and initialValue, making it reusable and adaptable to different contexts.

- **Pass** (80%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  The component includes onKeyDown handlers for Enter (to open/close or select an option) and Escape (to close the dropdown), which addresses basic keyboard interaction.  
  However, the code does not implement arrow key navigation through the dropdown options, which might be expected for complete keyboard navigation. This is why the confidence level is not at 100%.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  The code correctly uses useRef to manage focus interactions, aligning with React best practices in handling DOM elements.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  With the onFocus event opening the dropdown and the use of ref for focusing the element programmatically, the component shows suitable focus management.

- **Fail** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  The component does not include ARIA attributes (such as role="listbox" or aria-activedescendant) which are important for accessibility. This omission adversely affects the componentâ€™s accessibility.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  Based on the provided code, there is no indication of errors or warnings. However, since actual runtime testing has not been performed here, there is a slight uncertainty (thus 90%).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  The state and effect usage appear optimized for the intended functionality and do not include constructs that trigger excessive re-renders.
