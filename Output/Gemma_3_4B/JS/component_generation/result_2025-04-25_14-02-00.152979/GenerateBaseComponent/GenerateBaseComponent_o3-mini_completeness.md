# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
   The component conditionally renders a <div> with the "dropdown" class when the state "isOpen" is true, which qualifies as a dropdown select UI element.

2. **Fail** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
   The component defines a "handleSearch" function and maintains a "searchTerm" state, but there is no search input element rendered in the JSX. The filtering is applied directly on the options list without providing an <input> or similar control for user search input.

3. **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
   The component uses a state ("selectedOption") and the "handleOptionClick" function to update this state. It only allows one option to be selected at a time.

4. **Fail** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
   The componentâ€™s keyboard handling is limited to "Enter" and "Escape" keys. There is no implementation for navigation using the up or down arrow keys.

5. **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
   Each dropdown <li> has an onKeyDown handler that listens for the "Enter" key and subsequently triggers the selection of the corresponding option.

6. **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
   The onKeyDown handler on the select container toggles the dropdown's visibility when the "Enter" key is pressed, as seen via the "handleEnterKey" function.

7. **Fail** (90%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
   While the onClick event on the select container calls dropdownRef.current.focus(), this focus management is only explicitly handled when clicking on the container. There is no comprehensive focus management in place for all dropdown-closing scenarios (e.g., when closing via keyboard actions such as "Escape" or after selecting an option via Enter), which might cause inconsistent focus behavior. The 90% confidence comes from the partial handling observed in the onClick case.

8. **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
   The "handleOptionClick" function, which is triggered when a list item is clicked, sets "isOpen" to false, effectively closing the dropdown.

9. **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
   In addition to the mouse-click handler, each list item also listens for the "Enter" key to trigger "handleOptionClick", which closes the dropdown.

10. **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
    The onKeyDown handler on the main select container detects the "Escape" key and calls "handleEscapeKey", which sets "isOpen" to false, ensuring the dropdown closes.

11. **Fail** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
    The component does not include any logic (such as a document click listener) to detect clicks outside the component. The current onClick logic only affects clicks within the component itself.

12. **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
    The event handler on the select container opens the dropdown when it detects an "Enter" key press while the component is focused.
