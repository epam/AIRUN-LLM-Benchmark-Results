# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application uses React 18.x or newer by checking the package.json dependencies

    The package.json dependencies show React 18.2.0, which meets the requirement for React 18.x or newer:
    ```json
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    ```
    However, the code contains inconsistencies with how Redux is used that make it non-functional. There are references to `setCharacters` and `setError` functions in App.tsx that aren't defined anywhere, showing a mismatch between Redux implementation and component logic.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that TypeScript is properly implemented with appropriate type definitions for all components, props, and states

    While TypeScript is included in the dependencies, there are multiple type issues:
    - Types for Redux state are missing
    - In App.tsx, functions like `setCharacters` and `setError` are used but not defined
    - No proper type definition for the Redux store

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Axios is used for API requests to fetch data from the Star Wars API endpoint

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that the application handles API errors gracefully with appropriate error states or messages

    The App.tsx attempts to handle errors by using `setError`, but this function is not defined. The Redux slice does have error handling, but it's not correctly implemented in the component.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the character data is fetched on component mount using useEffect hook

    While useEffect is used for fetching on component mount, it uses local state functions (`setCharacters`, `setError`) that don't exist, rather than dispatching Redux actions.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application properly manages component rendering optimization

    The code doesn't demonstrate any rendering optimization techniques. Additionally, the broken state management would cause rendering issues.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the code follows React best practices using hooks appropriately

    There are serious mismatches between the Redux implementation and component implementation:
    - App.tsx uses Redux selectors but then tries to update state with non-existent setter functions
    - The Redux slice defines async thunks but these aren't dispatched in the component
    - There's no configuration for the Redux store in the provided code

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't contain any TODO comments or unnecessary code

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the codebase has minimal comments that only clarify complex logic when necessary

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the API endpoint 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' is being called correctly

    While the endpoint URL is correct, the actual API call would fail due to implementation issues. In App.tsx, the data fetching doesn't use the Redux thunk actions, and in the Redux slice, the response structure isn't handled correctly (SWAPI returns an object with a `results` array, but the code tries to return `response.data.results` directly).

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application renders without console errors or warnings

    This application would generate multiple runtime errors if executed due to:
    - Undefined functions being called (`setCharacters`, `setError`)
    - Missing Redux store configuration
    - Inconsistent state management between Redux and component code
