# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API

    The code attempts to display Star Wars characters, but there's a critical issue in the App.tsx file. While it uses Redux selectors to access state, it also tries to use non-existent `setCharacters` and `setError` functions in the useEffect hook. This would cause runtime errors as these setter functions aren't defined anywhere in the component. In a correct implementation, the component should dispatch Redux actions instead.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls

    Although a LoadingIndicator component is imported and conditionally rendered based on the isLoading state, the implementation has issues. The loading state wouldn't be properly updated due to the broken state management approach in the App.tsx file.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI

    The application attempts to map and render all characters, but due to the Redux implementation issues, the characters wouldn't be properly stored in state and therefore wouldn't be rendered in the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields

    The application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name

    The code attempts to display the character name in the ListItem component. However, due to the state management issues, it's unlikely the characters would render properly. The structure itself (mapping over characters and displaying name) is correct, but the implementation has issues.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App

    The package.json includes dependencies and scripts that suggest Create React App, such as react-scripts. However, it's not explicitly stated that Create React App was used, and some important dependencies like react-scripts are not in the dependencies section.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states

    There are significant issues with the state management implementation:
    - In App.tsx, there's a mixture of Redux (using useSelector) and non-existent local state setters
    - The charactersSlice.ts has a builder pattern for handling async thunks, but in App.tsx these thunks aren't dispatched
    - The src/redux/store.ts file is imported but not provided in the code sample

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering

    The application correctly uses character.url as the unique key when mapping over characters to render ListItems.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately

    There's no specific handling for empty data states. While the code will map over an empty array if no characters are found, it doesn't provide any user feedback for this specific scenario (like "No characters found"). It only handles loading states and error states.
