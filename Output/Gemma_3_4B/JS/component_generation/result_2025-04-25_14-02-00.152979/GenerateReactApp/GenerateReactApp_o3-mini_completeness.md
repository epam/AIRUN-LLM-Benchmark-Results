# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  Although the component maps over a "characters" array from the Redux state and should display character names, the actual data fetching in App.tsx is problematic. The useEffect function calls axios and attempts to update state with functions like setCharacters and setError, which are not defined in the context of this component. Moreover, the Redux async thunk fetchCharacters is defined but never dispatched. Because of this disconnect, it is unlikely that the character list will be successfully displayed at runtime.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The App component conditionally renders a LoadingIndicator based on the "isLoading" flag from the Redux state. However, since the data fetching is performed by a local axios call (which does not update the Redux state) and the fetchCharacters thunk is never dispatched, the "isLoading" state is never set appropriately. Consequently, the loading indicator might not behave as expected.

- **Fail** (95%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  Even though there is mapping over "characters" which should render each item, the faulty data fetching logic (calling undefined setCharacters) means that the characters array is never populated as intended. Thus, not all (or any) characters fetched from the API will be displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  The provided code does not contain any search bars or input fields. The application’s interface is focused solely on fetching and displaying character data without any user input elements.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  The List component maps over the "characters" array and each ListItem is rendered using the character’s URL as a unique key and displays the character’s name. If the data were fetched correctly, each entry would be properly displayed. The only caveat lies in the data fetching issues noted earlier, but the UI structure for displaying a character is correct.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The presence of a package.json with scripts like "react-scripts start", "build", and "eject" strongly indicates that the application structure was generated using Create React App.

- **Fail** (95%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  Although Redux Toolkit is implemented in the redux slice to manage characters, loading, and error states, the App component does not dispatch the Redux async action (fetchCharacters) to update these states. Instead, it attempts to manage API responses via undefined local functions. This inconsistency results in improper state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  The mapping over the character list uses "character.url" as the key for each ListItem, which is a proper approach to ensure that each element has a unique key.

- **Fail** (80%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  The application renders the list even when the data is empty, but it does not provide any explicit indication (such as a placeholder message) that no characters are available. Without proper handling for empty states, the user might be presented with a blank list without any guidance.
