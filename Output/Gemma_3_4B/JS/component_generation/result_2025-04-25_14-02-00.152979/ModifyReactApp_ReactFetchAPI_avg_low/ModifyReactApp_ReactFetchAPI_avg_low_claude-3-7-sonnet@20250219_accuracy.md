# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type

    The code shows a `searchQuery` state variable managed with `useState<string>('')` and uses `setSearchQuery` to update it. However, there's no actual input field rendered in the JSX. The code only shows state management for search but doesn't render an input field where users can type.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls

    The code doesn't implement any debouncing pattern. The API call is triggered immediately when `searchQuery` changes through the useEffect dependency array `[searchQuery]`. There's no implementation of setTimeout, lodash.debounce, or any other debouncing mechanism to delay API calls while the user is typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured

    The code imports axios and uses it correctly for API requests with `axios.get('https://swapi.dev/api/people', { params: { search: searchQuery } })`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses

    The code uses TypeScript properly with interface definitions for Character, explicitly typed state variables using `useState<Type>()`, and the component is defined as `React.FC`.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters

    The code correctly uses the axios params option to add search parameters: `axios.get('https://swapi.dev/api/people', { params: { search: searchQuery } })`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate

    The code implements `useMemo` to optimize the filtering of characters based on the search query, preventing unnecessary recalculations when unrelated state changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback

    Error handling is implemented with try/catch/finally blocks, logging errors to console and setting characters to empty array when errors occur. The finally block ensures loading state is updated regardless of success or failure.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing

    The code triggers API calls immediately when the searchQuery changes without any delay or debouncing mechanism. This means an API call would be made for each keystroke.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices

    The code follows React best practices for state management using useState and useEffect hooks appropriately. However, the double filtering (once in the API call and once client-side) could be redundant, and there's no actual UI for the search input despite having the state for it.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code

    The code appears clean with no unused imports or commented-out code. All imported packages are used.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests

    Loading state is properly managed with `setLoading(true)` before the API call and `setLoading(false)` in the finally block to ensure it's updated regardless of success or failure.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns

    The component uses functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo) which aligns with modern React patterns supported in React 18.x.
