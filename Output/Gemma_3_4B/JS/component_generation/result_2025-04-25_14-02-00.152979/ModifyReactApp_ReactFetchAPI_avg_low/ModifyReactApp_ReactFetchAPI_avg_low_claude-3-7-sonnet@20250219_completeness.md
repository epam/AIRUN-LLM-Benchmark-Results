# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name

    The code does not include an actual search input field in the JSX. While there's state (`searchQuery`) and logic to handle filtering, there's no `<input>` element or form control where users can enter their search query. The component is missing the UI element that would allow users to interact with the search functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests

    The code clearly shows a loading indicator with the line: `if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;` which displays while the `loading` state is true during API requests.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query

    The component initializes `searchQuery` as an empty string with `useState<string>('')` and the `useEffect` hook will trigger on component mount, making the initial API call with this empty search query.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type

    While there's logic to update results based on the `searchQuery` state, there's no input element to capture user typing and no event handler to update the `searchQuery` state as the user types. The filtering logic exists, but there's no way for users to actually type and trigger the dynamic updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found

    The code includes a clear feedback message when no results are found: `if (filteredCharacters.length === 0) { return <div>No characters found for "{searchQuery}"</div>; }`

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design

    The code doesn't contain any responsive design elements, CSS, media queries, or responsive frameworks. The UI is basic HTML without any styling considerations for different screen sizes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response

    The code correctly displays the filtered character list after the API response is received: `return ( <ul> {filteredCharacters.map((character) => ( <li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li> ))} </ul> );`

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed

    The code includes error handling in the API call with a try/catch block that gracefully handles errors: `catch (error) { console.error('Failed to fetch characters:', error); setCharacters([]); setLoading(false); }`

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props

    The code defines the `Character` interface for API data and uses TypeScript properly throughout, including type annotations for state variables: `useState<Character[]>([])`, `useState<boolean>(true)`, `useState<string>('')`, and the component is properly typed as `React.FC`.

- **Fail** (95%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities

    Without seeing the original code, it's difficult to be 100% certain, but there's a logical inconsistency in the implementation. The code both uses the SWAPI API's search capability (`params: { search: searchQuery }`) and then also filters the results client-side with `useMemo`. This double filtering is redundant and suggests the developer might not understand how the API works. Additionally, the lack of an actual search input field means users can't actually use the search functionality.
