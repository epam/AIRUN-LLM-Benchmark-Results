# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The code defines a state variable (searchQuery) and even provides logic to filter characters, but it does not render any search input field (for example, an <input> element). Without the input element, users cannot type to update the search query, so this step fails.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  The code clearly returns a loading indicator ("Loading...") when the state variable loading is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  The initial state for searchQuery is set to an empty string, and the useEffect hook runs upon mount (and whenever searchQuery changes). This causes an API call on mount with an empty search value, thus satisfying this requirement.

- **Fail** (95%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  Although the code uses useMemo to filter results when searchQuery changes, there is no user interface element (such as an <input> field) to capture user typing. The dynamic behavior is set up but cannot be exercised by a user. I am 95% confident in this evaluation because the internal mechanism is present, but the user-facing control is missing.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  The component returns a message ("No characters found for …") if the filteredCharacters array is empty, which provides clear visual feedback for no results.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The code does not include any styling or responsive design techniques (e.g., media queries or responsive CSS classes). Although this might be handled elsewhere in an application, based solely on the provided code, there is no evidence of responsive design. I am 90% confident in this assessment as the absence of CSS or layout adjustments is evident.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  The code maps over the filteredCharacters array to display a list item for each character, ensuring that results from the API are shown.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  While the code does include error handling within the data fetch (using try-catch and logging errors), it does not implement React error boundaries or any higher-level error handling. Without React error boundaries, unexpected JavaScript errors in the component’s subtree could crash the app. This step, therefore, fails.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The code defines a TypeScript interface for Character and uses proper type annotations for useState and the component itself (React.FC), satisfying this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The character fetching logic remains intact, and the search functionality (though incomplete from a UI perspective) is integrated into the data fetching and filtering logic. Hence, the original functionality appears maintained.
