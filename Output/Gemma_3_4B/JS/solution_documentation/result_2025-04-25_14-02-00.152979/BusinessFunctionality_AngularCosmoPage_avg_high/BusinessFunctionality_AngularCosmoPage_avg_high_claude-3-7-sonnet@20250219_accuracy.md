- **Fail** (90%): Verify that the documentation accurately describes the local storage recovery mechanism for unsaved changes

    The documentation mentions local storage is used for caching page versions, but it doesn't specifically describe a recovery mechanism for unsaved changes. While it does mention "The application synchronizes data between the client and the backend through the RESTful API," it doesn't explicitly detail how unsaved changes are recovered if a user navigates away or if the browser crashes.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm that the documentation correctly explains the version comparison and management features

    The documentation mentions version control functionality including a mechanism to compare versions and choose whether to adopt newer versions. However, it doesn't provide specific details on how the comparison is visualized or the complete workflow.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately explains the auto-URL generation from title functionality

    The documentation does not mention any auto-URL generation from title functionality. This feature, which would automatically create a URL slug based on the page title, is not addressed in the documentation.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the documentation correctly describes the tag autocompletion and suggestion system

    The documentation mentions that the form includes fields for tags, but it doesn't describe any tag autocompletion or suggestion system. This specific functionality is completely missing from the documentation.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation accurately explains the publication scheduling system
- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately describes the handling of page revisions and extras
