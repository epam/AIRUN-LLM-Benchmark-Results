# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation identifies all major components (REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, pageCtrl)
  
  The documentation clearly identifies and describes all major components of the application, including the REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and the page controller (pageCtrl.js).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the purpose of the REST factory for API communication
  
  The documentation explains that the REST factory provides services for interacting with a RESTful backend and uses $resource to create reusable HTTP clients for various API endpoints.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes all API endpoints exposed in the REST factory
  
  While the documentation mentions that the REST factory includes services for various resource types (blocks, comments, content, files, menus, etc.), it does not provide a comprehensive list of all API endpoints exposed by the factory.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains the Page factory and its role in storing global page variables
  
  The documentation clearly explains that the Page factory "holds the state of a single page object" and is "used to store the page's data globally and provide a central point for managing page properties."

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the Users factory and its purpose for user data management
  
  The documentation states that the Users factory "stores user information, including ID, username, name, and role."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page controller's responsibilities and features
  
  The documentation explains that the page controller "manages the logic and behavior of the page template" and "handles user interactions, calls the REST factory to interact with the backend, and updates the page data."

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the local storage mechanism for unsaved changes
  
  While the documentation mentions that local storage is used for caching page versions, it does not specifically describe a mechanism for handling unsaved changes.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate the documentation explains the version comparison functionality
  
  The documentation mentions version control functionality that allows users to "compare the versions and choose to discard the newer version or use it." However, it does not provide detailed information about how the comparison itself works.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the page creation workflow
  
  The documentation clearly describes the page creation workflow: "The user starts on a `/new` route. They fill out the form, select a page type, and click 'Save.' The controller uses the `REST` factory to create a new page resource on the backend."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page editing workflow
  
  The documentation clearly explains the page editing workflow: "The user navigates to a page's detail view (e.g., `/page/123`). The controller retrieves the page data from the backend using the `REST` factory. The user edits the form and clicks 'Save.' The controller updates the page resource on the backend."

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the page duplication feature
  
  The documentation describes the page duplication feature: "The user clicks the 'Duplicate' button. The controller creates a copy of the current page and navigates to the new page's detail view."

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains the page deletion process
  
  The documentation clearly explains the page deletion process: "The user clicks the 'Delete' button. A confirmation dialog appears. If the user confirms, the controller calls the `REST` factory to delete the page resource on the backend."

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the auto-URL generation from title feature
  
  The documentation does not mention or describe an auto-URL generation feature that creates URLs based on page titles.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the documentation explains tag management and autocompletion
  
  While the documentation mentions that the page editing form includes fields for tags, it does not explain tag management or any autocompletion functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the publication status options (publish, draft, schedule)
  
  The documentation clearly states that "Radio buttons allow the user to set the page's publishing status (Published, Draft, Scheduled)."

- **Fail** (100%): Validate the documentation explains scheduled content publishing
  
  Although the documentation mentions scheduling as a publishing option, it does not explain how scheduled content publishing works or is implemented.

- **Pass** (80%): Ensure the documentation describes page revision management
  
  The documentation mentions version control that allows users to maintain a history of page versions and revert to previous states. However, it doesn't provide details about how revisions are managed or tracked.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the handling of page extras and additional data
  
  The documentation does not mention or describe the handling of page extras or additional data.
