# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies the application as an Angular.js application for web content management  
  The answer clearly explains that the application is built using AngularJS/Angular and describes its use in web content management.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately describes the REST factory for backend communication  
  The explanation accurately identifies the REST factory ("rest.js") as using Angular’s $resource to interact with the RESTful API with methods including PUT for updating resources.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation correctly explains the Page factory for storing global page variables  
  The documentation specifies that the Page factory holds the state of a page object and acts as a central point for managing page data, which matches the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately describes the Users factory for storing current user data  
  The Users factory is described as storing user information (ID, username, name, role), which is consistent with the evaluation step.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation correctly explains the page controller functionality  
  The answer explains that the page controller (pageCtrl.js) handles user interactions, interacts with the REST factory, and updates page data, satisfying the evaluation criterion.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation accurately explains the page creation and editing process  
  The explanation covers the process for creating a new page (using the /new route and form filling) and editing an existing page (fetching and updating page data), which meets the evaluation requirements.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that the documentation accurately describes the local storage recovery mechanism for unsaved changes  
  Although the answer mentions that local storage is used for caching page versions, it does not specifically describe a recovery mechanism for unsaved changes. This gap leads to a failure in this evaluation step.  
  Reason: The text focuses on version caching rather than explicitly addressing recovery of unsaved changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation correctly explains the version comparison and management features  
  The answer includes a "Version Control" section that explains how the application handles newer versions of a page, including form dialogs for comparison and adoption of versions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation accurately describes the page deletion workflow  
  The documentation details that a confirmation dialog is shown upon deletion and that the REST factory is used to remove the page resource, which appropriately covers the deletion workflow.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately explains the auto-URL generation from title functionality  
  The answer mentions a field for the URL in the page editing form but does not mention any auto-generation of the URL from the title. This feature is not covered in the documentation.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the documentation correctly describes the tag autocompletion and suggestion system  
  Although tags are mentioned as a field in the form, the answer does not discuss any autocompletion or suggestion mechanism for tags, which is expected by the evaluation step.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation accurately explains the publication scheduling system  
  The answer clearly describes the presence of radio buttons for publishing, drafting, and scheduling options, and explains that pages can be published immediately or scheduled for future publication.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that the documentation accurately describes the handling of page revisions and extras  
  The documentation outlines a version control mechanism for page revisions but does not provide details on handling any additional “extras” associated with page revisions.  
  Reason: While the version control aspect is addressed, the explanation lacks specifics on any extra metadata or components that might be associated with page revisions.
