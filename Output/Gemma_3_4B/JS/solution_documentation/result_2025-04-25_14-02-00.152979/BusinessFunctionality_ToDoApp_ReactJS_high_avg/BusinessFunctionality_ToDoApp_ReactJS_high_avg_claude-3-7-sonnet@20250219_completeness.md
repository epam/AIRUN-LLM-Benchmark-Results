# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers all main functionality including adding, editing, deleting, and toggling todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about filtering todos by status (all, active, completed)
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the user workflow for creating new todo items
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the editing functionality triggered by double-clicking
- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the clear completed functionality
- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the document describes the toggle all functionality

  The document does not mention any functionality for toggling all todos at once. In typical Todo applications, there is often a checkbox or button that allows users to mark all items as complete or incomplete in a single action. This functionality is not described anywhere in the document.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the counter for remaining items
- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the persistent storage of todos
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the UI components and their relationships
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the business objectives addressed by the application
- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes performance and scalability considerations
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes technical constraints and limitations
- **Fail** (90%): Ensure the document covers the pluralization of item/items text based on count

  The document does not explicitly mention the pluralization of item/items text based on count. While the document does mention that the TodoFooter "displays the number of active and completed to-dos," it does not specify that the text changes between singular and plural forms based on the count (e.g., "1 item left" vs. "2 items left"). I am 90% confident in this evaluation because there is a slight possibility that this detail could be implied in the description of the TodoFooter component, though it is not explicitly stated.
