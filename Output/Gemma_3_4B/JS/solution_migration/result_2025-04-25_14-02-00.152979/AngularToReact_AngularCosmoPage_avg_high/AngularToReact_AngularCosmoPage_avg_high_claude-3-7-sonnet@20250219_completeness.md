# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (85%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented

    While the code provides a Redux slice structure for pages and mentions page functionality, it doesn't explicitly implement all required page management functions. The `updatePage` reducer is mentioned but not fully implemented, and there are no clear implementations for create, delete, or duplicate functionality. I'm not 100% confident because the code provides a high-level overview that might imply these functions would be implemented in the detailed implementation.

- **Fail** (95%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present

    There is no explicit implementation of page type selection functionality in the provided code. Although the Redux state includes a `type` field in the page slice's initial state, there is no component or logic shown for selecting or managing different page types.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists

    There is no implementation or mention of URL auto-generation from title functionality in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented

    The code mentions tags in the page state model, but there is no implementation of tag management or autocomplete suggestions anywhere in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available

    While the initial state includes a `publish` field with a default value of 'N', there is no implementation of publish status options or UI components to manage publishing states.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented

    The initial state includes a `scheduleDate` field, but there is no implementation of scheduled publishing functionality in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present

    There is no implementation or mention of local storage version comparison or restoration features in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented

    The code does not implement or mention any notification system for success/error messages.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present

    There is no implementation of form validation for required fields in the provided code.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled

    While the code mentions creating an `api.js` file and provides a simple example for `getBlocks`, it doesn't properly handle or map all the API endpoints from the original code. I'm not 100% confident because this is a high-level overview, and the intention might be to implement all endpoints in the detailed implementation.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented

    Although `extras` is included in the initial state of the page slice, there is no implementation of extras management functionality in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained

    There is no implementation or mention of revision history functionality in the provided code.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components

    The code demonstrates organization with a feature folder structure (src/features) and separation of business logic (Redux slices) from UI components. It proposes components like PageEditor.js, PageDetails.js, etc., which suggests a reasonable separation. However, I'm not 100% confident as we don't see the complete folder structure or implementation details.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved

    The code briefly mentions exploring libraries like 'react-i18next' to replace Angular's $translate but does not implement or describe a concrete translation functionality replacement.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters

    There is no implementation or discussion of URL structure and parameters in the provided code.
