# Evaluation Report

1. **Fail** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props  
   The answer does not show TypeScript implementations in the provided code snippets. It only mentions adding TypeScript in Phase 3 without actually providing interfaces or type annotations.

2. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management  
   The answer uses Redux Toolkit’s createSlice in both pageSlice and usersSlice, demonstrating global state management.

3. **Pass** (95%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components  
   The answer instructs the migration to use React functional components (e.g., Page, PageEditor), although no explicit functional component code is shown. Confidence is slightly reduced because the illustrative code samples do not include component implementations.

4. **Pass** (90%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately  
   The answer advises the use of hooks such as useState for form handling and recommends React.memo and Suspense for performance. However, there are no concrete code examples demonstrating proper hook usage, hence the 90% confidence rather than 100%.

5. **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource  
   The provided api.js code snippet uses axios for API calls, which meets the criteria.

6. **Pass** (90%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components  
   The migration plan specifically recommends replacing Angular’s form bindings with controlled components and useState. Although no explicit form code is given, the recommendation aligns with the evaluation step.

7. **Pass** (85%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation  
   The answer includes installing react-router-dom and mentions its usage in the migration plan. However, there’s no actual code snippet implementing routes, so the confidence level is slightly lower.

8. **Pass** (80%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization  
   The answer suggests exploring libraries like react-i18next to replace Angular’s $translate. Since there is only a recommendation without implementation details, confidence is moderate.

9. **Pass** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization  
   The plan mentions using React.lazy and Suspense for code splitting, meeting the requirement.

10. **Pass** (90%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations  
    The answer states that React.memo should be applied to prevent unnecessary re-renders. No example is provided, so while the recommendation is present, the evidence is indirect.

11. **Fail** (90%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks  
    There is no discussion or code example showing the use of dependency arrays in useEffect or similar hooks. The lack of explicit demonstration leads to a failure with 90% confidence.

12. **Fail** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models  
    The provided code and instructions do not include any TypeScript interfaces for data models; only JavaScript is used with the suggestion to add TypeScript later.

13. **Pass** (80%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state  
    The migration plan mentions using useSelector to access the state, which implies the use of Redux selectors. However, no code example is provided, so the confidence is a bit lower.

14. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations  
    Action creators are defined as part of each createSlice (e.g., updatePage, resetPage), which meets the requirement.

15. **Fail** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks  
    There is no mention or implementation of local storage functionality in the answer.
