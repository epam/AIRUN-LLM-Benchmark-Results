# Evaluation Report

Below is the evaluation of the provided React migration roadmap against the specified evaluation steps:

1. **Fail** (90%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
   The roadmap shows some state update functions (e.g., update and reset actions in the Redux slices) and briefly mentions components for editing and deleting. However, there is no clear reference to implementing the "create" functionality or a "duplicate" feature. Because these core functionalities are not explicitly covered, this step is marked as failing.  
   *Explanation: While portions of state management are addressed, key operations such as creation and duplication are omitted.*

2. **Fail** (95%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
   The answer’s Redux state includes a "type" field, but the migration plan does not explicitly mention a dedicated mechanism or UI component for selecting page types.  
   *Explanation: The absence of detailed discussion on the page type selection in the React components suggests that this functionality may not have been fully addressed.*

3. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
   There is no explicit mention of a feature that takes a title and generates a URL automatically.  
   *Explanation: While the state includes fields like "url" and "title," the conversion of title to URL (typically featured by auto-generation logic) is not demonstrated.*

4. **Fail** (90%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
   Although the initial state has a "tags" array, the migration plan does not discuss the implementation of tag management, nor does it outline how autocomplete for tag suggestions would be handled.  
   *Explanation: The lack of detailed instructions or components to handle autocomplete suggests that this part of the functionality is missing.*

5. **Pass** (70%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
   The roadmap touches on publishing by including a "publish" property (with a default of 'N') and mentioning a "PageControls.js" component for actions like publishing and deleting. However, specifics for the "draft" and "schedule" options are not elaborated upon.  
   *Explanation: While the presence of a publish state and control component is positive, the detailed handling of all required statuses is not fully clear, so confidence is lower.*

6. **Fail** (80%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
   The Redux state includes a "scheduleDate" field, indicating intent to support scheduled publishing. However, there is no further discussion on how users would set or manage scheduled dates in the UI.  
   *Explanation: The inclusion in state is a good sign, but the roadmap lacks specifics on the scheduling functionality at the component level.*

7. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
   There is no mention of any mechanism to compare local storage versions or restore previous versions, which is a notable functionality from the original code.  
   *Explanation: This fully absent detail leads to a clear failure on this step.*

8. **Fail** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
   The roadmap does not reference any implementation or integration of a notification system (e.g., using toasts, alerts) that would inform the user of success or error events.  
   *Explanation: Without any indication of notifications in either the Redux slices or the component design, this functionality appears missing.*

9. **Fail** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
   There is no clear direction for incorporating form validation rules or using libraries/methods to enforce validations on required fields such as URL or page type within the components.  
   *Explanation: The answer does mention controlled components and useState for form handling, but it does not address explicit form validation.*

10. **Fail** (90%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
    The provided API logic only illustrates an example call (getBlocks) using axios. There is no comprehensive mapping of all original API endpoints to the new system.  
    *Explanation: The example demonstrates intent, but it is not sufficient to confirm that every necessary endpoint is covered.*

11. **Fail** (90%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
    Although the Redux state contains an "extras" field, no details are provided on how extras will be managed, updated, or rendered in the new React application.  
    *Explanation: The omission of any UI or dedicated logic for extras management results in this step failing.*

12. **Fail** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
    There is no mention in the roadmap of handling revision history, which was part of the original functionality.  
    *Explanation: The absence of any revision or version history mechanism is a clear gap.*

13. **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
    The migration guide clearly shows the creation of a "features" directory for Redux slices and separates API calls and store configuration from UI components.  
    *Explanation: This organization aligns well with modern best practices for code separation.*

14. **Pass** (90%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
    The roadmap briefly addresses this by mentioning the migration from Angular’s $translate to libraries like react-i18next for translation, ensuring that internationalization is accounted for.  
    *Explanation: Although the discussion is high-level and lacks detailed implementation steps, it does indicate an intent to preserve translation functionality.*

15. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
    There is no explanation of how the URL structure and parameter management (common in Angular routing) would be handled in the React implementation, especially with regard to React Router integration.  
    *Explanation: The roadmap does not discuss strategies to ensure that the same URL structure is maintained during the migration.*
