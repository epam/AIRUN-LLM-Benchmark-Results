# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling
  
  The code clearly imports and uses Angular's Reactive Forms modules (`FormBuilder`, `FormGroup`, `Validators`) and creates a form group properly with the `formBuilder.group()` method.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)
  
  The validation is incorrectly implemented. In the `ngOnInit()` method, the validators are provided incorrectly. The correct syntax would be to provide an array of validators, not comma-separated validators:
  
  ```typescript
  this.signupForm = this.formBuilder.group({
    name: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.pattern('^[a-zA-Zа-яА-Я ]{3,60}$')]],
    email: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.email]],
    password: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.minLength(6)]]
  });
  ```

- **Fail** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use
  
  There is no implementation of asynchronous validation in the provided code. A proper implementation would include async validators for checking if a name or email is already in use, connecting to the API service.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched
  
  While the FormGroupComponent does include some error message display logic, it doesn't properly handle success states, and the implementation doesn't clearly show how field states (valid/invalid/touched) are communicated to the template.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions
  
  The submission logic doesn't call an API service directly. It only dispatches an action to the store, but there's no implementation of effects to handle the API call, and no evidence of proper success/error handling.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails
  
  The FormGroupComponent template does include logic to display error messages when a field is touched and invalid. However, I'm less than 100% confident because it's not clear how the actual error messages are generated and passed to this component.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service
  
  While there is an import for `getTitle` from a utils file, there is no implementation of Angular's Title service to set the document title.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management
  
  The code imports and injects the Store, but there is no implementation of @ngrx/effects visible. The SignupAction is dispatched, but there's no evidence of effects to handle side effects like API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress
  
  The code sets `submitting = true` when the form is submitted, which can be used to disable the submit button, although the template for this is not shown.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses
  
  There is no implementation of success/error handling for the API call. The code only dispatches an action but doesn't handle responses.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management
  
  The component does follow most Angular best practices with proper imports, dependency injection, and lifecycle hook usage. However, the full implementation is not visible to be 100% confident.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises
  
  While HttpClient is imported and injected, there are no direct HTTP calls made in the SignupComponent. The SignupService shows proper use of HttpClient, but it's not used in the actual component.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements
  
  The error messages defined in the validation functions don't match any specific requirements, and there's no clear mechanism to ensure these messages are displayed correctly in the UI.
