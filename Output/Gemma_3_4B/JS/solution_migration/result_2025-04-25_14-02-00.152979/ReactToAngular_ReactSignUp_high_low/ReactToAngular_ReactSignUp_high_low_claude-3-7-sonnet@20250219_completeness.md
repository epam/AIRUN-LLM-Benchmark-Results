# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component includes all three required form fields: name, email, and password
  
- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page includes a heading 'Join PodBaby today.'
  
  The provided Angular implementation does not include any HTML template content with the heading "Join PodBaby today." The SignupComponent only includes the TypeScript class definition without the accompanying template that would contain this heading.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the page includes a lead paragraph about membership benefits
  
  The implementation does not include any HTML template with a lead paragraph about membership benefits. The template content is missing from the SignupComponent.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the form includes a submit button with appropriate styling and icon
  
  The HTML template for the SignupComponent is not provided, and there is no implementation of a submit button with appropriate styling and icon in the code snippets provided.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the page includes a link to the login page with appropriate text
  
  The implementation does not include a link to the login page. The HTML template is missing, and there is no code for navigation to a login page.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the FormGroup component or equivalent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display
  
  A FormGroupComponent is implemented that accepts a form control as input and displays error messages when the field is touched and invalid. However, it's not clear if this implementation fully matches the requirements since it's a simplified version without detailed styling or full error handling capabilities.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the Icon component or equivalent is implemented for the signup button
  
  There is no implementation of an Icon component or equivalent for the signup button in the provided code.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all validation rules are implemented (name length, email format, password length)
  
  The SignupComponent includes methods for validating name length (3-60 characters), email format (using a regex pattern), and password length (minimum 6 characters). These validation rules are implemented in the validateName, validateEmail, and validatePassword methods.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure asynchronous validation for both name and email uniqueness is implemented
  
  While there's a SignupService with placeholder methods for name and email validation, the actual implementation of asynchronous validation for uniqueness is missing from the SignupComponent. The form is configured with only synchronous validators.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify the signup API integration is complete with proper error handling
  
  The code includes a SignupService with a signup method that makes an HTTP POST request to an API endpoint. There's also a dispatch to a SignupAction in the onSubmit method. However, the error handling is minimal, and there's no clear implementation of how API responses or errors are handled after the form submission.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the form layout matches the horizontal form structure specified
  
  There is no indication of a horizontal form layout in the provided code. The HTML template is missing, and there's no styling or layout specification for a horizontal form.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page has proper document title setting functionality
  
  While there's an import of getTitle from a utils file, there's no implementation of document title setting in the SignupComponent. The ngOnInit method does not include any code to set the document title.
