# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The component is built with Angular’s FormBuilder and FormGroup, which confirms the use of Reactive Forms.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The component sets validators using a regular expression for name, the built-in email and required validators for email, and Validators.minLength(6) for the password.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  Although the provided code includes a SignupService with methods isName and isEmail for asynchronous validation, these methods are never called in the SignupComponent. The component does not implement async validators that check name or email availability.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The FormGroupComponent template displays error messages if the field is touched and invalid. However, the implementation assumes that the control’s error object is directly iterable, which may need further refinement depending on the structure of errors. This results in a high but not complete confidence in the styling and feedback.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  The onSubmit method dispatches a SignupAction via @ngrx/store but does not make an explicit call to the SignupService’s signup method. Thus, the API call is not directly invoked from the component, which does not fully align with the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The FormGroupComponent includes a div that displays error messages when the form control is touched and invalid.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  Although the SignupComponent imports a getTitle utility, there is no invocation of Angular’s Title service to set or update the page title.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The component imports and uses @ngrx/store to dispatch an action. However, there is no visible integration or mention of @ngrx/effects within the code. Without any effects-related code or configuration shown here, this requirement is not met.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  While the component sets a submitting flag to true on form submission, there is no evidence in the provided code (no template snippet for the submit button) that this flag is used to disable the submit button.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  The provided SignupService makes an API call via HttpClient.post but does not show any explicit handling (like catchError or subscription handling) for success and error responses.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component is structured with proper separation of concerns (template, component, service) and uses Angular lifecycle hooks appropriately. Minor improvements might be applicable for robust error handling and full separation of business logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The SignupService clearly demonstrates the use of Angular’s HttpClient to perform HTTP requests, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The component and the additional custom validation methods return error messages (e.g., for name length, valid email, password requirements). However, it is unclear if these messages are consistently rendered within the UI, leading to a slightly less than full confidence level.
