# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component includes all three required form fields: name, email, and password  
  The componentâ€™s reactive form is defined with controls for "name", "email", and "password".

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page includes a heading 'Join PodBaby today.'  
  There is no evidence of any heading containing the text "Join PodBaby today." in the code provided.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the page includes a lead paragraph about membership benefits  
  The provided code does not include a lead paragraph or any descriptive text about membership benefits.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the form includes a submit button with appropriate styling and icon  
  There is no template snippet showing a submit button or any associated styling and icon for submission.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the page includes a link to the login page with appropriate text  
  The code does not include any link or routing element that directs to a login page.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the FormGroup component or equivalent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display  
  The provided FormGroupComponent includes input binding, error display logic, and styling for errors.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the Icon component or equivalent is implemented for the signup button  
  There is no Icon component or equivalent implementation shown for any signup button icon in the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all validation rules are implemented (name length, email format, password length)  
  The signup component uses Angular validators that enforce a name pattern for specific length, built-in email validation, and a minimum length for the password.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure asynchronous validation for both name and email uniqueness is implemented  
  Although the SignupService provides methods for name and email validation, these are not integrated as asynchronous validators with the reactive form.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify the signup API integration is complete with proper error handling  
  The SignupService demonstrates the API call structure, but error handling is minimal or absent, and the component does not show any error management logic. Confidence is slightly lower since the API integration is only conceptual and may be intended to be extended.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the form layout matches the horizontal form structure specified  
  There is no indication that a horizontal form layout has been implemented in the provided code; layout details are missing.
