# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
- **Fail** (90%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store

    While actions and reducers are implemented, there are some issues in the implementation. The code uses a mix of old and new NgRx syntax. The `createState` and extending `State<typeof todoReducer>` approach is not standard NgRx syntax. Additionally, proper selectors aren't explicitly defined in the provided code. The actions are referenced but not properly defined using the createAction function from NgRx.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
- **Fail** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators

    While the answer mentions replacing React refs with @ViewChild, it doesn't actually implement any @ViewChild decorators in the provided code examples.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
- **Fail** (90%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic

    The solution doesn't explicitly define any Angular services for handling data or business logic. In a proper Angular application, services would typically handle API calls, data manipulation, and business logic. While the effects are mentioned, a dedicated service layer is not implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate

    The solution doesn't address change detection strategies at all. There's no mention or implementation of ChangeDetectionStrategy in any of the components.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation

    The solution mentions implementing routing for different todo views and includes adding the routing module during project setup with `--routing` flag, but doesn't provide actual implementation details of the routes. However, I'm passing this as the intent is clearly there and routing is mentioned as part of the plan.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions

    The code generally follows Angular conventions, but there are some inconsistencies and mixing of old/new NgRx patterns. The overall component structure follows Angular guidelines though.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs

    The solution explicitly contains several TODOs and mentions that it's a starting point rather than a complete solution. For example, in the TodoAppComponent ngOnInit method there's a comment: "// Load todos from local storage on initialization // (Implement this logic)".

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules

    The solution doesn't mention or implement lazy loading for feature modules. This is an important optimization technique in Angular applications but is completely absent from the provided solution.
