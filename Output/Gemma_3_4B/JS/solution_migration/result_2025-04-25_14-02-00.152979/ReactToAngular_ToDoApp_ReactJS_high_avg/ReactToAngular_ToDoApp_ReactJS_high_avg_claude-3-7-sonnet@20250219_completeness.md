# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items
  
  The provided code does not include a complete implementation for displaying todo items. While there is a basic structure for the TodoState with todos array and a simplified TodoItemComponent, the actual implementation for retrieving and displaying todos is missing. The TodoAppComponent template doesn't include iteration over the todos to display them.

- **Fail** (95%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented
  
  The action for adding todos (addTodo) is defined in the reducer, but the actual implementation for capturing user input and dispatching the action is missing from the provided components. There's an input field in the TodoAppComponent template but no event handler to process the input and add a new todo.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works
  
  While the toggle action is defined in the reducer and there's a basic structure for the TodoItemComponent with an onToggle output, the complete implementation for toggling todos is missing. The TodoItemComponent has a checkbox but the full implementation to dispatch the toggle action isn't shown.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented
  
  The code includes a 'save' action in the reducer but does not implement UI components or event handlers for editing todo items. There is no double-click functionality or edit mode shown in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented
  
  While the 'destroy' action is defined in the reducer, there is no UI implementation for deleting todo items. The TodoItemComponent doesn't include a delete button or related functionality.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented
  
  The toggleAll action is defined in the reducer and there's a button in the TodoAppComponent that calls toggleAll, but it's hardcoded to false rather than toggling based on the current state. The implementation is incomplete.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works
  
  The code mentions 'nowShowing' in the initial state, but there's no implementation for filtering todos based on this state. No routing configuration or filter buttons are implemented.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items
  
  There is no implementation for a footer component or logic to count and display active items.

- **Fail** (95%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items
  
  While the clearCompleted action is defined in the reducer and there's a button in the TodoAppComponent that calls clearCompleted, there's no logic to conditionally show/hide this button or to provide feedback to the user.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage
  
  The code mentions loading todos from local storage in a comment but does not implement the actual persistence logic. The TodoEffects class uses HTTP rather than local storage and is incomplete.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation
  
  While the code mentions implementing routing for different views, no actual routing configuration is provided to maintain the URL structure for navigation.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states
  
  There is no implementation for handling empty states or displaying appropriate UI when there are no todos.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly
  
  There is no implementation for form submissions or preventing default browser behavior when adding or editing todos.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships
  
  The code provides a basic component structure with TodoAppComponent and TodoItemComponent, but the relationships between components are incomplete. Parent-child communication is partially defined but not fully implemented.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved
  
  The code provides a foundation but does not preserve all business logic. Many key features are missing or incompletely implemented, such as editing, filtering, counting active items, and local storage persistence.
