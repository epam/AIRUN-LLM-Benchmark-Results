# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The provided Angular migration includes a TodoItem component, but the main TodoAppComponent template does not iterate over and display the list of todos. This omission prevents the application from showing all todo items to the user.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  Although an input field for entering a new todo is present in the TodoAppComponent template, there is no event handler or dispatch action shown to add a new todo item. The “addTodo” action is mentioned in the store, but its integration into the UI is missing.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  Individual todo toggling is partially represented in the TodoItemComponent with a checkbox and an EventEmitter for toggle events. However, there is no clear implementation connecting the emitted event with a dispatch to update the store (except for “toggleAll” which is separately handled), leaving the toggling of individual items unverified.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  While the reducer includes a case for the “save” action that would handle editing, the UI and component logic for editing a todo item (such as an input field or edit mode) are not provided in the answer.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  The reducer defines a “destroy” action to remove a todo, but there is no UI component or control (e.g., a delete button) shown in either the TodoAppComponent or the TodoItemComponent to invoke this action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  The TodoAppComponent includes a button labeled “Mark all as complete” that calls the toggleAll method. This method dispatches the toggleAll action, which is implemented in the reducer. Therefore, this functionality is present.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  Although the state includes a “nowShowing” property to hold the current filter, there is no UI or filtering logic shown in the provided code to switch between these views.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  There is no footer component or section in the UI showing the count of active (uncompleted) todo items.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The TodoAppComponent template includes a “Clear completed” button that calls a clearCompleted method. This method dispatches the clearCompleted action, and the reducer correctly filters out completed todos. Thus, this functionality has been implemented.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  The provided code comments mention loading todos from local storage in ngOnInit, but no actual implementation is given for persisting or retrieving data from local storage. The TodoEffects class instead references an HTTP call, which does not address local storage persistence directly.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The answer shows that the Angular project is set up with routing (using the --routing flag), but no routing configuration or URL structure management is demonstrated to mirror the original application's navigation.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  There is no implementation provided regarding the UI or messaging to indicate an empty state when no todo items exist.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  Although an input field is present for adding todos, there is no code showing form submission handling (such as an event binding or a submit event) to process new entries.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The migration plan separates concerns by creating distinct components (TodoAppComponent and TodoItemComponent) and a centralized store. However, the integration between TodoAppComponent and TodoItemComponent (e.g., iterating over and passing todo data) is not fully demonstrated, so while the intent for proper component separation is present, the execution is not completely clear. (I am 80% confident this meets the intended architecture but 20% uncertain due to missing integration details.)

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  Many actions (like adding, editing, deleting, and filtering todos) are referenced in the reducers and store actions. However, the UI components do not fully implement or demonstrate triggering these actions, and several key features (such as editing and filtering) are missing, indicating that the complete business logic is not preserved.
