# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The answer clearly specifies using Angular 14.x in the project setup instructions: "Create a new Angular 14.x project using the Angular CLI: `ng new todomvc-angular`"

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS
  
  The code snippets use ES modules with TypeScript import/export syntax instead of RequireJS, as shown in the imports for @ngrx/store and other libraries.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management
  
  The answer explicitly includes installation of @ngrx/store and implements store-related code with actions and reducers in the `store.ts` and `reducers.ts` files.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects
  
  The answer includes installation of @ngrx/effects and provides a skeleton effects class in `effects.ts`.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management
  
  The answer defines actions (AddTodoAction, MarkCompleteAction, etc.), a reducer (todoReducer), and a selector (selectTodo). While the effects class is defined, it doesn't contain implemented effect methods yet.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator
  
  Both the TodoEffects and TodoService classes are properly decorated with @Injectable and use the recommended providedIn: 'root' approach.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service
  
  The answer does not implement localStorage for data persistence. Instead, it uses HttpClient to communicate with a backend API in the TodoService.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators
  
  While the answer mentions creating components (TodoComponent, TodoListComponent, etc.), it doesn't include any actual component implementations with @Component decorators.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators
  
  The answer does not include any directives with @Directive decorators.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)
  
  The answer mentions using Angular's data binding features like "*ngFor, *ngIf, [(ngModel)]" in the "Template Migration" section, but doesn't show actual template implementations.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))
  
  The answer mentions Angular's data binding features, which would include event binding, but doesn't show explicit examples of (click) or other event bindings.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])
  
  The answer mentions Angular's data binding features but doesn't explicitly show property binding examples like [class.completed].

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed
  
  The answer does not include any implementation of Angular lifecycle hooks.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models
  
  The answer uses TypeScript classes for actions, and the reducer shows that todos would have properties like id, title, and completed, implying a data model, though it doesn't explicitly define a Todo interface or class.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services
  
  The answer shows proper dependency injection in the TodoService with HttpClient being injected through the constructor.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code follows Angular style guide conventions with proper naming (camelCase for methods, PascalCase for classes), separation of concerns, and recommended patterns like providedIn: 'root'.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings
  
  The answer does not address console errors or warnings, and there's no indication that the provided code has been tested for errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)
  
  The code uses TypeScript features like types, interfaces, enums, and classes appropriately in the provided snippets.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code
  
  The provided code snippets don't contain any TODOs or commented-out code.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design
  
  The answer proposes a component structure that follows single responsibility principle (TodoComponent, TodoListComponent, TodoFormComponent, FooterComponent), but doesn't provide the actual implementation details.
