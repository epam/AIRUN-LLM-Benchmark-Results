# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list
  
  The answer outlines a `TodoListComponent` that is responsible for displaying a list of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos
  
  The answer includes a `TodoFormComponent` specifically designed to handle adding new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos
  
  The `TodoComponent` is mentioned as being responsible for displaying a single todo item, which would likely include editing functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos
  
  The `FooterComponent` is mentioned to display filters, and the answer discusses setting up routing to handle different views (All, Active, Completed).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics
  
  The `FooterComponent` is mentioned to display the remaining count.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos
  
  The answer includes an `AddTodoAction` in the state management and also implements an `addTodo` method in the `TodoService`.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos
  
  While the answer mentions the `TodoComponent` for displaying a single todo item, it doesn't explicitly describe edit functionality. The state actions defined include `MARK_COMPLETE`, `REMOVE`, `TOGGLE`, and `CLEAR`, but no explicit edit action or method for editing the title of a todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos
  
  The answer includes a `RemoveTodoAction` in the state management and a `removeTodo` method in the `TodoService`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed
  
  The answer includes a `MarkCompleteAction` and `ToggleTodoAction` in the state management and a `toggleTodo` method in the `TodoService`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The answer mentions setting up routing to handle different views (All, Active, Completed).

- **Fail** (80%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete
  
  There is no explicit action or method for marking all todos as complete/incomplete in the provided code snippets.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos
  
  While there is a `ClearTodosAction`, it appears to clear all todos, not just the completed ones, based on the reducer implementation which returns an empty array.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos
  
  The `FooterComponent` is explicitly mentioned to display the remaining count.

- **Fail** (80%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage
  
  While the answer mentions that "The `TodoStorageModule` needs to be adapted to use Angular's `HttpClient`", it doesn't explicitly implement localStorage persistence. The service methods all use HTTP calls instead.

- **Fail** (80%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization
  
  The answer doesn't explicitly describe loading todos from persistence on initialization.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing
  
  There is no mention of keyboard event handling, specifically for the escape key to cancel editing.

  There is no mention of automatically focusing on input fields when editing.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original

  There is no discussion of validation or handling of empty todo titles.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter
  
  The answer mentions "Integrate NGRX Router Store to manage the application's routing state" and setting up routing to handle different views, which implies URL updates based on filters.
