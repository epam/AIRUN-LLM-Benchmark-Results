# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
   The answer explicitly instructs the creation of a new Angular 14.x project using the Angular CLI.

2. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
   The provided code uses TypeScript import statements (ES modules), and there is no indication of the use of RequireJS.

3. **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
   The answer includes installation and usage of @ngrx/store and defines actions and a reducer for state management.

4. **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
   An effects file (effects.ts) using @ngrx/effects is provided, even though its implementation is minimal, it confirms the intended integration.

5. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
   Although actions, a reducer, and a selector (selectTodo) are defined, the action type definitions are problematic. All action types in the enum are assigned the same value ("TodoType"), which is not appropriate for differentiating actions.

6. **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
   Both the TodoService and TodoEffects classes are decorated with @Injectable with correct providedIn syntax.

7. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
   The provided TodoService uses HttpClient for data persistence and does not implement any localStorage-based persistence as required by this evaluation step.

8. **Fail** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
   While a component structure is described (e.g., TodoComponent, TodoListComponent, etc.), no actual component code demonstrating the use of @Component decorators is provided.

9. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
   The answer does not include any custom Angular directives or their usage with the @Directive decorator.

10. **Fail** (90%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
    The answer suggests that HTML templates should be migrated using Angularâ€™s data-binding features (like *ngFor and *ngIf), but no actual template examples are given.

11. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
    There is no example or mention of event binding syntax (e.g., (click)) in the provided answer.

12. **Fail** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
    There is no demonstration of property binding in the component templates in the answer.

13. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
    The answer does not provide any component code that includes Angular lifecycle hooks (e.g., ngOnInit, ngOnDestroy).

14. **Fail** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
    Although the answer creates action classes, it does not define dedicated TypeScript interfaces or classes for todo data models.

15. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
    While dependency injection is correctly shown in the TodoService (injecting HttpClient), the provided code does not include component examples to fully confirm the correct implementation of dependency injection throughout the application.

16. **Fail** (80%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
    The code contains some structural guidance for an Angular project; however, certain aspects (such as the duplication of action type values and the lack of type safety in the reducer) suggest that it does not fully adhere to the recommended Angular style guide conventions.

17. **Fail** (80%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
    There is no evidence provided (e.g., run-time logs or tests) that the application is free of console errors or warnings. Additionally, the duplicated action types could potentially lead to runtime issues.

18. **Fail** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
    The code uses TypeScript in some parts; however, the reducer and state management portions lack proper type definitions and interfaces, indicating a less-than-ideal use of TypeScript features.

19. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
    The answer does not show any leftover TODO comments or commented-out code.

20. **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application follows the single responsibility principle in component design  
    The design is segmented into different components (TodoComponent, TodoListComponent, TodoFormComponent, FooterComponent) and services, which indicates a commendable effort toward maintaining the single responsibility principle. However, the absence of actual component code means this is taken on face value from the design outline.
