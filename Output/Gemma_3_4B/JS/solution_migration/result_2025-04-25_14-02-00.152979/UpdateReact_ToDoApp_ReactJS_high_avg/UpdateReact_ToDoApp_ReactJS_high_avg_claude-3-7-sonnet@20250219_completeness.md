# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed

    The code provided shows an implementation for this functionality in the `handleNewTodoKeyDown` method, but there's an issue. The code references `ReactDOM.findDOMNode(this.refs["newField"])` which is a deprecated approach in React 18. The newer approach would use React refs with `useRef` for functional components or `createRef` for class components. Additionally, the implementation still uses the TodoModel directly rather than dispatching Redux actions as would be expected in the Redux Toolkit migration.

- **Fail** (95%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter

    The code shows filtering logic in the `render` method that filters todos based on the `nowShowing` state. However, the implementation doesn't fully leverage Redux. In a proper Redux implementation, the filtering would typically be handled by selectors rather than directly in the component.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos

    While the code includes a `toggleAll` method in both the TodoModel and the Redux slice, the component is still calling `this.props.model.toggleAll(checked)` instead of dispatching the Redux action `toggleAll`. This fails to properly implement the Redux pattern described in the migration plan.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted

    The code includes methods for toggle, edit, save, and destroy, but they're still using the TodoModel directly instead of dispatching Redux actions. The migration is incomplete as these operations are not properly connected to Redux.

- **Pass** (85%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode

    The code appears to implement an edit method and passes it to the TodoItem component, which suggests this functionality is present. The state update `this.setState({editing: todo.id})` indicates editing mode is tracked. However, this is still using class component patterns rather than the hooks pattern mentioned in Phase 3.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo

    The code provides a save method that updates the TodoModel and clears the editing state. While not shown directly in the snippets, it's reasonable to assume the TodoItem component would handle the Enter key for submitting edits.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value

    The `cancel` method which resets the editing state to null suggests this functionality exists, and it's passed to the TodoItem component. Again, the actual key handling would be in the TodoItem component.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items

    The code calculates `activeTodoCount` and passes it to the TodoFooter component, which suggests this functionality is implemented.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)

    The code references filter constants (ALL_TODOS, ACTIVE_TODOS, COMPLETED_TODOS) and the TodoFooter component appears to receive the current filter value (`nowShowing`).

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos

    The code includes a `clearCompleted` method which is passed to the TodoFooter component as an event handler, suggesting this functionality exists.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence

    The Redux implementation doesn't include any persistence layer. While the original TodoModel uses `Utils.store`, which presumably handles localStorage, the Redux implementation doesn't include equivalent functionality such as redux-persist or similar.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state

    The code includes conditional rendering for the footer and main sections based on the presence and state of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count

    The code mentions `Utils.pluralize` which suggests this functionality exists, and the TodoFooter component receives `count` which would be used for pluralization.

- **Fail** (95%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components

    While there is some component composition (TodoApp, TodoItem, TodoFooter), the migration doesn't fully convert to functional components and hooks as described in Phase 3. The component structure still reflects the older class-based approach.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality

    The code demonstrates organization into separate files for models, components, and Redux slices, showing appropriate separation of concerns.
