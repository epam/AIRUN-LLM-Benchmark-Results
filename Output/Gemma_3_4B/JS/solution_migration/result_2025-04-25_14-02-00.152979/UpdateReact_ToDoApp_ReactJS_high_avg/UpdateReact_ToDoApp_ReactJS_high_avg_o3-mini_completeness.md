# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
   The code in handleNewTodoKeyDown checks for the ENTER_KEY and, upon a valid non-empty input, calls this.props.model.addTodo to create a new todo.

2. **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
   The render method filters todos based on the nowShowing state (ALL_TODOS, ACTIVE_TODOS, COMPLETED_TODOS) and maps the filtered list to TodoItem components.

3. **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
   The toggleAll method is implemented and the input checkbox in the main section is wired to call it on change, which in turn invokes model.toggleAll.

4. **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
   The TodoApp passes appropriate functions (toggle, edit, destroy, save) as props to TodoItem, ensuring these actions can be triggered per todo item.

5. **Pass** (90%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
   While the TodoApp component provides an onEdit callback (passed to TodoItem) and manages an editing state, the explicit binding of a double-click event is assumed to take place inside the TodoItem component. Confidence is 90% because the internal implementation of TodoItem isn’t shown in the answer.

6. **Pass** (90%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
   The TodoApp component includes an onSave prop passed to TodoItem and a save method that calls model.save, which implies that an edited todo is submitted via Enter (likely handled within TodoItem). Confidence is 90% due to the lack of explicit onKeyDown handling within the provided snippet for the editing case.

7. **Pass** (80%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
   An onCancel prop is provided and linked to a cancel method resetting the editing state. However, the actual detection of the Escape key is not demonstrated in the TodoApp code, so we assume it is handled in TodoItem. Confidence is slightly lower (80%) due to that assumption.

8. **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
   The code calculates activeTodoCount correctly and passes it to the TodoFooter component for display.

9. **Pass** (90%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
   The TodoFooter is passed the nowShowing state along with counts, suggesting that it is responsible for rendering filter links or buttons. Confidence is 90% because the internal implementation of TodoFooter isn’t shown.

10. **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
    The footer is provided with an onClearCompleted prop, ensuring that a clear-completed action is available.

11. **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
    The TodoModel uses Utils.store for both retrieving and updating todos, indicating that localStorage is employed for persistence.

12. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
    The rendering of main and footer sections is conditional (e.g., based on todos.length and counts), ensuring dynamic UI updates.

13. **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
    Although the Utils.pluralize function is defined and likely used in the TodoFooter, its usage is not explicitly shown. Confidence is 90% based on the available evidence.

14. **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
    The implementation separates concerns by using dedicated components like TodoItem and TodoFooter, and organizing related functionalities into separate files.

15. **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
    Files such as todoModel.ts, todoSlice.ts, store.ts, and app.tsx indicate a modular and feature-oriented organization.
