# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'
  
  The provided App.tsx component clearly includes a header with the 'Virtual Piano' title:
  ```typescript
  <header className={styles.header}>
    <h1 className={styles.headerTitle}>Virtual Piano</h1>
  </header>
  ```

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons
  
  The BtnPanel component has a syntax error in its declaration: `constBtnPanel` should be `const BtnPanel`. Also, the implementation is incorrect as both buttons are implemented but they don't work properly together. The "Letters" button is not wired up with the toggle functionality:
  ```typescript
  <button className="btn btn-letters">Letters</button>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)
  
  The Piano component maps over the keys array and renders a PianoKey component for each key, including both natural and sharp keys as specified in the data structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes
  
  Each PianoKey component includes data attributes for both letters and notes:
  ```typescript
  <div
    className={`piano-key ${data.letter} ${data.sharp ? 'sharp' : ''}`}
    style={keyStyle}
    data-letter={data.letter}
    data-note={data.note}
  />
  ```

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked
  
  The code does not include any implementation for loading or playing audio files. The soundMapper interface is defined in types.ts, but there's no actual audio implementation in the Piano.tsx component.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)
  
  The PianoKey component includes conditional styling for active keys, but the implementation in Piano.tsx for setting activeKeys has some issues. It adds keys but the filter logic for removing them doesn't appear to work as expected. Also, there's no `onClick` handler in the PianoKey component's props interface.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes
  
  The code does not include any keyboard event listeners to detect key presses. It only handles clicks on the piano keys, not keyboard input.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked
  
  While the code includes state for toggling between notes and letters modes, the implementation is incomplete. The "Letters" button doesn't have an onClick handler, and there's no actual rendering logic to display either notes or letters on the keys.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes
  
  The code mentions a fullscreen function in the comments, but there is no actual implementation of a fullscreen button or the fullscreen functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly
  
  The activeKeys state in Piano.tsx could potentially handle multiple key states, but the implementation is flawed and there's no proper handling for multiple simultaneous key presses.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys
  
  There is no implementation for mouse drag events or functionality for playing notes when dragging across piano keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information
  
  The App.tsx component includes a footer with the year "2020":
  ```typescript
  <footer className={styles.footer}>
    <div className={styles.footerContainer}>
      2020
    </div>
  </footer>
  ```
