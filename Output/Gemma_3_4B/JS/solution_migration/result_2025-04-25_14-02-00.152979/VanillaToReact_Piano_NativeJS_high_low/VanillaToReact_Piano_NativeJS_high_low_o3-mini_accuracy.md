# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration  
  The answer begins by showing the use of “npx create-react-app virtual-piano --template typescript,” which confirms that the application is set up using Create React App with TypeScript and is intended to run on React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure  
  The answer defines TypeScript interfaces in the file “types.ts” (e.g. PianoKeyData and SoundMapper), which meets the requirement for using specific interfaces to map audio elements.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks  
  All components (PianoKey, Piano, BtnPanel, and App) are implemented as functional components using React.FC. Furthermore, hooks like useState and useEffect are used in components such as Piano and App.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)  
  The answer demonstrates proper state management by using useState for active keys and isLettersMode, and useEffect to reset keys when the mode changes.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels  
  The code includes a function named handleKeyClick that expects a keyboard event; however, it is passed as an onClick event handler rather than binding directly to keyboard events. This mismatch indicates that keyboard events may not be handled appropriately. The confidence is 90% because while an attempt is made to incorporate a handler, it does not correctly use keyboard events.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events  
  The provided code primarily uses onClick events. There is no implementation of mouse-specific events such as mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, or mousemove, which are mentioned in the evaluation requirements.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment  
  Although the answer outlines an interface for audio resource mapping and mentions that audio elements would be managed, the provided code does not include concrete implementation details for handling audio playback or integration with React lifecycles.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility  
  The answer briefly notes that a fullscreen function is implemented using requestFullscreen and exitFullscreen, but no actual code is provided. Therefore, we cannot verify if React patterns or browser compatibility issues have been addressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns  
  The code uses both inline styling and conditional class application (e.g., applying a “sharp” class or using the ternary operator for active/inactive keys) which meets this requirement.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate  
  The answer mentions that React.memo could be used for the PianoKey component; however, the provided implementation does not actually use React.memo (or other optimizations), failing to meet this requirement.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations  
  No code is provided to handle audio playback or integrate it with React component lifecycles. The description mentions audio handling, but without concrete lifecycle management, this requirement is not met.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application  
  The code makes good use of TypeScript through interface definitions and annotating component props. However, minor issues like the missing space in the declaration for BtnPanel (“constBtnPanel” instead of “const BtnPanel”) slightly affect its strictness. Therefore, the confidence is 95%.
