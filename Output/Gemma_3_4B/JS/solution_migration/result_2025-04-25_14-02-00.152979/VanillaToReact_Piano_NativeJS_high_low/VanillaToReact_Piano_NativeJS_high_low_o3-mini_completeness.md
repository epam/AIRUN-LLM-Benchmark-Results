# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'  
  The App component includes a header with an h1 element showing "Virtual Piano", confirming the header is rendered correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons  
  The BtnPanel component creates a container with two buttons labeled "Notes" and "Letters". Although only one button toggles the state via onClick, both buttons are present as required.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)  
  The Piano component maps through the provided keys array (containing both natural and sharp keys) and renders a PianoKey for each entry.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes  
  The PianoKey component renders a div with data attributes "data-letter" and "data-note" that reflect the properties of each key as specified.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked  
  Although the answer mentions a "soundMapper" and that audio elements are managed in the Piano component, no actual code is provided to load or play audio when keys are clicked, so this functionality is missing.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)  
  The Piano component maintains an "activeKeys" state and passes an "isActive" prop to PianoKey. However, the PianoKey component does not implement an onClick or any interaction handler to update its state, meaning that while the intended highlighting logic is there, the interactive mechanism to trigger it is not correctly wired. (The uncertainty is due to the partial implementation intent; the provided code does not fully enable this behavior.)

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes  
  The code defines a handleKeyClick intended for keyboard events; however, this function is attached as an onClick handler for piano keys rather than a window-level or keydown listener. This misconfiguration means keyboard input for playing notes is not properly handled.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked  
  The BtnPanel component assigns toggle behavior only to the 'Notes' button. The 'Letters' button does not have an onClick handler, resulting in a toggle implementation that does not fully meet the requirement.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes  
  The answer mentions implementing fullscreen functionality via Reactâ€™s requestFullscreen and exitFullscreen methods, but no code or UI element (fullscreen button) is provided in the implementation.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly  
  There is no specific logic to manage or properly handle multiple key presses at the same time. The state management approach (activeKeys array) does not include safeguards or separate handling for concurrent interactions, making this functionality incomplete.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys  
  No code is provided to support mouse drag interactions across piano keys; this interactivity aspect is not implemented in the provided code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information  
  The App component includes a footer element that displays "2020", thereby meeting the footer requirement.
