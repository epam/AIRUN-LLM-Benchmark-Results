# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos

    The provided code does not include a clear implementation of a header component with a title and input field for creating new todos. While there is a structure for the application and references to adding todos in the Redux slice, there is no specific component or JSX showing a header with a title and input field implementation.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos

    The code shows a `TodoList.tsx` component in the structure, but the implementation is not provided. Additionally, there is no visible implementation of a toggle-all checkbox in the snippets provided. The Redux setup includes functionality for todos, but the UI implementation for the main section is missing.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button

    The `TodoItem.tsx` component clearly shows the implementation of a todo item with a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button (labeled as "Delete"). The component includes appropriate handlers for toggling and destroying todos.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode

    There is no implementation for enabling an editing mode when double-clicking a todo label. The `TodoItem` component provided does not include any event handlers for double-clicking or any state management related to editing mode.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)

    The Redux implementation includes filtering functionality with the `filter` state property in both the todos and filters slices. The `selectFilter` selector is also implemented, and there are references to filtering in the Redux state, suggesting this functionality is supported.

- **Fail** (80%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization

    While the Redux store contains `activeTodoCount` and `activeTodoWord` properties which suggest an intent to implement this feature, there is no actual footer component implementation showing how these values are displayed to the user.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter

    The code structure mentions a `Footer.tsx` component, but no implementation is provided. There is no evidence of filter links or highlighting of the current selected filter in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist

    The Redux implementation includes a `clearCompletedTodos` action, but there is no UI implementation showing a 'Clear completed' button in the footer.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter

    The Redux implementation includes an `addTodo` action that supports adding new todos, but the specific UI implementation for typing and handling the Enter key is not provided in the code snippets.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos

    The `TodoItem` component clearly implements a toggle checkbox with a `handleToggle` function that dispatches the `toggleTodo` action, allowing users to toggle the completion status of individual todos.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once

    The Redux implementation mentions functionality for toggling todos, but there's no explicit implementation of a "toggle all" feature in the provided code snippets.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management

    There is no implementation for editing todos or focus management in the provided code snippets.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos

    The `TodoItem` component clearly implements a delete button with a `handleDestroy` function that dispatches the `destroyTodo` action, allowing users to delete individual todos.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos

    The Redux implementation includes a `clearCompletedTodos` action that supports clearing completed todos, but the UI implementation for this functionality is not provided in the code snippets.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status

    The Redux implementation includes a `filter` property and a `setFilter` action that supports filtering todos. The `App.tsx` component also includes a reference to the `selectFilter` selector, suggesting that filtering is implemented.
