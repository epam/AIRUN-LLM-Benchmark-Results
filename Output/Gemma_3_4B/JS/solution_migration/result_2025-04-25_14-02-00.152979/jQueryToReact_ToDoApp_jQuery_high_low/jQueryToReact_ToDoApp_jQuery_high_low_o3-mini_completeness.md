# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos  
  The provided answer does not include any explicit header component or an input field for creating new todos. Although the overall architecture is described, the actual UI element for this functionality is missing.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos  
  There is no demonstrated implementation of a main section that contains a toggle-all checkbox. While a TodoList component is mentioned, there is no evidence of the toggle-all functionality nor its container.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button  
  The TodoItem component clearly implements a checkbox (for toggling completion), displays the todo title, and includes a delete button.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode  
  There is no implementation for an editing mode or event handling (such as double-click) on the todo label in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  Even though a filter state and associated redux actions are implemented, there is no visible UI component (e.g., filter links/buttons) that allow a user to switch between filters.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization  
  While the todosSlice maintains variables like activeTodoCount and activeTodoWord, the UI code for the Footer is not provided, so it is unclear if the count and pluralization are rendered.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter  
  The provided answer does not include the code for a Footer component with filter links and their styling to indicate the active filter.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist  
  Even though the redux slice has an action for clearCompletedTodos, there is no accompanying UI implementation that provides a 'Clear completed' button in the footer.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter  
  There is no explicit input field implementation or handling for key events (such as Enter) to create a new todo in the provided answer.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos  
  The TodoItem component uses a checkbox with an onChange handler that dispatches a toggle action, confirming this functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once  
  No implementation is provided that would allow the user to toggle all todos with a single action.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management  
  There is no code that indicates support for editing a todo item (such as an input field for modifying an existing todo), nor any management of focus during editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos  
  The TodoItem component includes a button that dispatches a destroy action, which handles deletion.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos  
  Although the clearCompletedTodos reducer is defined, there is no UI demonstrated that triggers this functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status  
  The redux slice and selectors for filtering are present; however, there is no corresponding UI component in the answer that applies the filter to the displayed list of todos.
