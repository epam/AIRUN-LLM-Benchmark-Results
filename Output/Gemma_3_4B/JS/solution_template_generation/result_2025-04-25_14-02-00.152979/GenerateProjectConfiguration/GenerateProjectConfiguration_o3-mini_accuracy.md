# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Vite is configured as the build tool with appropriate configuration files  
  The project includes a vite.config.ts file and the package.json has a script "dev": "vite", confirming Vite is used as the build tool.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm TypeScript is properly configured with a tsconfig.json file containing correct compiler options  
  The project contains a tsconfig.json file. Although the internal compiler options are not shown, its presence along with TypeScript dependencies implies proper configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the React setup includes necessary entry points and proper component structure  
  The structure includes an index.ts (entry point) and an App.tsx along with a components directory, following modern React conventions.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that Redux is implemented with appropriate store configuration, reducers, and actions  
  Redux is present through the store.ts file, reducers in the redux/reducers folder, and additional feature-specific Redux setup (counterSlice.ts) in the features directory.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify React Router is correctly configured with defined routes and navigation components  
  The presence of routes/AppRouter.tsx indicates that React Router is set up for client-side navigation.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure testing libraries are properly configured with appropriate test setup files  
  The package.json includes Jest and testing library dependencies with relevant scripts ("test" and "test:watch"). However, no explicit jest.config.js or setup files are provided, which slightly lowers certainty.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate package.json includes correct dependencies with compatible version specifications  
  The provided package.json lists the necessary dependencies (React, Redux, React Router, etc.) with compatible and recent version numbers.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm package.json contains scripts for development, building, and testing operations  
  The included scripts ("dev", "build", "test", "test:watch", "lint", and "preview") cover core development, production, and testing operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the project structure follows modern React development conventions  
  The structure is well-organized with clear directories for components, features, redux, routes, and services, which aligns with modern React application standards.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that configuration files are production-ready with appropriate optimization settings  
  Production readiness is evidenced by inclusion of Viteâ€™s production build command, ESLint configuration, and a browserslist configuration, ensuring optimization and code quality in production.
