- **Fail** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up in the test file

    The provided answer is a high-level strategy document outlining approaches to testing, not an actual test implementation file. No test file with proper imports and setup for Jest and React Testing Library is included. The answer does mention that Jest and React Testing Library would be used, but doesn't demonstrate the actual setup in code.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that test cases are properly isolated and do not have interdependencies

    The answer only outlines theoretical test cases without any actual implementation. Since no code is provided, we cannot verify that test cases are properly isolated or use correct Jest fixtures like `beforeEach()` or proper cleanup methods. The answer describes what should be tested, but doesn't show how the tests would be implemented to ensure isolation.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that DOM events are simulated using proper React Testing Library methods

    While the answer mentions simulating user interactions in several test cases (e.g., "Test selecting an option by clicking on it"), it does not include actual code examples using React Testing Library methods like `fireEvent` or `userEvent`. Without implementation code, we cannot verify that DOM events are being simulated properly.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate that accessibility attributes are being tested appropriately

    The answer does mention testing for accessibility attributes in Test Case 1 (verifying "aria-label", "aria-live", etc.) and includes a dedicated section (#6) for Accessibility Testing. It specifically mentions verifying ARIA attributes and keyboard focus management, which are important aspects of accessibility testing. However, without implementation details, it's not possible to verify if the planned approach would be fully adequate.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure mocks are used for external dependencies where appropriate

    The answer includes a section on "Mocking Strategy" that correctly identifies the need to mock external dependencies like `formatGroupLabel`, `getOptionLabel`, and `getOptionValue` using `jest.mock()`. It correctly explains that mocking is essential for isolating the component from external dependencies. However, no actual mock implementation is provided.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify proper use of async/await for asynchronous testing where needed

    The answer does not discuss or demonstrate the use of async/await for handling asynchronous behavior in tests. While it mentions testing loading states (Test Case 20), it does not address how to properly test asynchronous operations that might be present in the Select component, such as option filtering or lazy loading.

- **Fail** (100%): Check that all assertions use appropriate Jest matchers

    No actual Jest assertions or matchers are provided in the answer. The answer describes what should be verified in each test case but doesn't include code examples showing specific Jest matchers (like `expect().toBeInTheDocument()`, `expect().toHaveAttribute()`, etc.) that would be appropriate for the assertions.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that tests include proper cleanup after each test case

    The answer does not address cleanup procedures for tests, such as using `afterEach()` or React Testing Library's `cleanup` function. There's no mention of handling potential side effects between tests or ensuring the DOM is reset properly after each test.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test descriptions clearly indicate what functionality is being tested

    The answer provides clear and descriptive test case names that accurately indicate what functionality is being tested. Each test case has a defined purpose, and the assertions section clearly states what should be verified. For example, "Test Case 1: Default Rendering" clearly indicates it's testing the basic rendering of the component with default props.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the test file follows best practices for organizing test cases (describe/it blocks)

    The answer does not demonstrate the use of Jest's `describe` and `it` blocks to organize tests. While it does group test cases into logical categories (rendering tests, user interaction tests, etc.), it doesn't show how these would be implemented using Jest's test organization structures.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that all event handlers are tested using appropriate simulation methods

    While the answer mentions testing various user interactions (keyboard navigation, mouse clicks, etc.), it doesn't provide code examples showing how event handlers would be tested using appropriate methods from React Testing Library like `fireEvent` or `userEvent`. Without implementation details, we cannot verify if event handlers would be tested correctly.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the test environment correctly simulates both mouse and keyboard interactions

    The answer mentions testing both mouse interactions (clicking, hovering) and keyboard interactions (arrow keys, tab, enter, etc.), but doesn't provide implementation details showing how these interactions would be simulated using React Testing Library. Without seeing the actual test code, we cannot verify that the test environment would correctly simulate these interactions.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for touch events properly simulate mobile interactions

    While the answer briefly mentions "isAppleDevice" and testing on "both desktop and mobile devices (simulated)," it doesn't provide specific details on how touch events would be simulated or tested. There's no mention of specific touch event handling or how to properly test mobile-specific interactions using React Testing Library.
