# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)  
   → The answer clearly recommends using Jasmine with Karma, which are widely accepted modern testing tools in the JavaScript ecosystem.

2. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints  
   → The answer discusses mocking the $resource service using Jasmine’s spyOn and mentions strategies for mocking HTTP requests to simulate REST API endpoints.

3. **Fail** (90%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation  
   → The answer outlines the structure with describe and it but does not explicitly mention the use of beforeEach or afterEach hooks to ensure proper test isolation. This lowers confidence slightly as test isolation is critical in AngularJS unit tests.

4. **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls  
   → The answer emphasizes mocking $resource and even suggests using tools like nock or sinon to simulate HTTP responses, thereby avoiding real API calls.

5. **Fail** (90%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection  
   → Although the answer focuses on the REST factory and mentions the need to set up the testing environment, it does not explicitly explain the use of AngularJS’s dependency injection (such as using the inject() function) to provide required dependencies.

6. **Fail** (90%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations  
   → The outline does not detail strategies for dealing with promises or asynchronous behavior (such as using done callbacks), which can be crucial when testing HTTP requests or asynchronous operations.

7. **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies  
   → The answer clearly recommends using Jasmine’s spyOn to create mocks and spies for the $resource service and other dependencies.

8. **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization  
   → The provided test structure uses the describe and it syntax, which ensures that tests are organized and easily maintainable.

9. **Pass** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls  
   → The answer explicitly outlines tests for scenarios such as successfully updating a resource and handling errors (e.g., returning an error if a block does not exist).

10. **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate  
    → Even though the outline mainly focuses on testing the REST factory, simulating user interactions is not a central requirement for these tests. Given the context, the answer is appropriate.

11. **Fail** (80%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage  
    → The answer does not mention any cleanup mechanisms (e.g., using afterEach for resetting states) or procedures to prevent state leakage between tests. This omission reduces confidence in complete test isolation.

12. **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested  
    → The test cases provided include descriptive names (e.g., “should return blocks resource”, “should successfully update a block”), which clearly explain the purpose of each test.

13. **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible  
    → The answer focuses on verifying observable outcomes such as returned resources and status codes rather than testing internal implementation details.
