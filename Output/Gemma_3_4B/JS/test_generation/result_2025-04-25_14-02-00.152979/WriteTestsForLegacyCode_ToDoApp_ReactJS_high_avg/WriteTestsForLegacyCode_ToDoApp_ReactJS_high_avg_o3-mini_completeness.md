# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (80%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering  
  Although the answer does not provide explicit code for App.tsx, it does mention creating a separate test file for App and testing routing, state updates, and rendering. The coverage is only outlined, so confidence is slightly less than 100%.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos  
  The answer discusses testing strategies in general for App.tsx but does not include any tests that specifically cover adding new todos.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos  
  There is no explicit mention or test code for toggling all todos within App.tsx.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos  
  The answer plans for testing filter functionality in TodoFooter rather than in App.tsx, so tests for filtering todos in the App component are not present.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  No specific tests for clearing completed todos in App.tsx are provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering  
  The provided TodoItem.test.tsx includes a test ensuring the component renders the todo text correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos  
  The tests for toggling (via checkbox), destroying (via a "Destroy" button), and editing (via double-click) are clearly present in the TodoItem.test.tsx file.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events  
  Although there is a test for canceling editing on a key event, it uses keyDown with keyCode 13 (commonly associated with the Enter key) instead of the Escape key, which deviates from the requirement to handle escape key events.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts  
  There is no sample or code provided for testing the rendering of the Footer component under various todo counts.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation  
  The answer does not include any test code that verifies the filter navigation in the footer component.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  No test code is provided for verifying the functionality of clearing completed todos in the footer.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos  
  The TodoModel.test.ts file includes tests that cover adding a todo, toggling all and single todos, saving, and destroying a todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions  
  The tests for subscribing and informing subscribers (by calling callbacks) in the TodoModel are present and clear.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  A test for clearing completed todos is provided and correctly verifies that completed todos are removed.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation  
  There are no tests provided for the uuid generation functionality in the utils.ts file.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality  
  The answer does not include any tests for verifying the pluralize function in utils.ts.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations  
  The provided answer does not include explicit tests for testing localStorage operations via the store function in utils.ts.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function  
  There is no test code offered for the extend function in utils.ts.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx  
  The answer shows files like TodoItem.test.tsx, which adheres to the naming convention. For non-React files (e.g. TodoModel), the provided name is TodoModel.test.ts. This slight deviation from the specified convention makes the confidence 80% rather than 100%.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data  
  The answer includes the creation of a sample todo fixture (e.g., the mockTodo object) in the TodoItem tests.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented  
  Although the answer mentions the need to test routing and potentially to mock the Router, no concrete test code or mocks for routing functionality are provided.
