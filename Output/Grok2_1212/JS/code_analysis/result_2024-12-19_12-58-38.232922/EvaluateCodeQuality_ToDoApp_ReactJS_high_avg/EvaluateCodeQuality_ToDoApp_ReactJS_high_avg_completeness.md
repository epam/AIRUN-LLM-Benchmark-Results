# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### 1. Ensure the use of `let` or `const` instead of `var`.
**Pass**: The provided code examples use `const` instead of `var`.

### 2. Verify that `refs` are replaced with React state and props for DOM manipulation.
**Pass**: The code examples replace `refs` with controlled components using React state.

### 3. Confirm that variable and function names are descriptive and meaningful.
**Pass**: The code examples improve variable names (e.g., `val` to `newTodoText`) and function names (e.g., `handleNewTodoKeyDown` to `handleTodoEnter`).

### 4. Look for consistent use of whitespace and indentation.
**Pass**: The code examples show consistent use of whitespace and indentation.

### 5. Ensure large methods are broken down into smaller, more manageable methods.
**Pass**: The code examples suggest breaking down large methods into smaller ones (e.g., `componentDidMount`).

### 6. Verify that inline event handlers are moved to class methods.
**Pass**: The code examples move inline event handlers to class methods.

### 7. Check for modular code structure with reusable components and functions.
**Pass**: The code examples suggest using modular state management and reusable components.

### 8. Confirm the use of TypeScript interfaces and types for better type safety.
**Pass**: The code examples use TypeScript interfaces and types for better type safety.

### 9. Check for the elimination of inefficient DOM manipulation methods like `ReactDOM.findDOMNode`.
**Pass**: The code examples eliminate the use of `ReactDOM.findDOMNode` and use controlled components instead.

### 10. Ensure that performance enhancements like `shouldComponentUpdate` are correctly implemented.
**Fail**: The provided code examples do not mention or implement `shouldComponentUpdate`.

### 11. Verify that unnecessary re-renders are minimized by using appropriate React lifecycle methods.
**Pass**: The code examples suggest using memoized functions to minimize unnecessary re-renders.

### 12. Ensure the addition of ARIA attributes to improve accessibility.
**Pass**: The code examples add ARIA attributes to improve accessibility.

### 13. Verify that all interactive elements have accessible names and roles.
**Pass**: The code examples ensure that interactive elements have accessible names and roles.

### 14. Check for proper use of semantic HTML elements.
**Pass**: The code examples use semantic HTML elements appropriately.
