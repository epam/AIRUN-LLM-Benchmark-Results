# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Ensure that the application uses `$resource` objects for RESTful API communication.**
   - **Pass**: The `rest.js` file defines a factory that uses Angular's `$resource` service to interact with a RESTful backend.

2. **Verify that the application saves page changes to local storage.**
   - **Pass**: The code uses local storage for managing unsaved versions of pages.

3. **Confirm that the application initializes the page type correctly.**
   - **Pass**: The `pageCtrl.js` file handles the initialization of page data, including title, description, URL, tags, and publication status.

4. **Validate that the application manages local storage for unsaved changes.**
   - **Pass**: The application manages unsaved versions of pages using local storage, allowing users to revert to saved versions or discard newer versions.

5. **Verify that the application handles errors during saving or updating pages.**
   - **Fail**: The code does not include explicit error handling or retry mechanisms for API calls, which could impact performance if the backend is slow or unresponsive.

6. **Confirm that the application broadcasts events to update page variables and settings when necessary.**
   - **Pass**: The application broadcasts notifications for actions like saving, updating, or deleting pages.

7. **Validate that the application uses promises and callbacks for asynchronous operations.**
   - **Pass**: The code uses callbacks and promises for asynchronous operations, which can help in managing performance by not blocking the UI thread.

8. **Validate that the application broadcasts notifications for various operations (e.g., page saving, updating, deleting).**
   - **Pass**: The application broadcasts notifications for actions like saving, updating, or deleting pages.

9. **Verify that the application supports scalability and maintainability through modular design.**
   - **Pass**: The use of factories and services in AngularJS allows for modular and scalable code structure.

10. **Confirm that the application optimizes performance through efficient API usage and local storage management.**
    - **Pass**: Using a RESTful API allows for efficient data retrieval and manipulation, and using local storage for managing unsaved versions can improve performance by reducing the need for server requests for temporary data.
