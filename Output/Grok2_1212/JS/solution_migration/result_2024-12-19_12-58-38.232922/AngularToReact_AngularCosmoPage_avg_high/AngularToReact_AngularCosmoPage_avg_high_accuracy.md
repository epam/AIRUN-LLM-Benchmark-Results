5. **Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.**
   - **Pass**: The code does not contain any console errors or warnings.

6. **Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.**
   - **Pass**: The app uses React state to manage form values instead of directly accessing DOM elements.

7. **Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React virtual DOM.**
   - **Pass**: The app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React's virtual DOM.

8. **Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React state and props.**
   - **Pass**: The app uses React state and props appropriately and does not overuse refs.

9. **Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.**

12. **App does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.**
    - **Pass**: This step is a duplicate of step 6 and has already been passed.

13. **App has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.**
    - **Pass**: The app maintains the same DOM tree structure and classes as the original application.

14. **Ensure that the store is properly configured and provided to the app.**
