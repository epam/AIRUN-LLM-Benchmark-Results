# Evaluation Report

## Step 1: Confirm that the state slices for page and user are correctly defined and managed.
**Pass**: The state slices for `page` and `users` are correctly defined using `createSlice` from Redux Toolkit. The reducers for setting and updating the state are also correctly implemented.

## Step 2: Verify that API service functions are correctly defined and used.
**Pass**: The API service functions are correctly defined using Axios. The functions for `blocks`, `blocksRequirements`, and `content` are correctly implemented to handle GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE requests.

## Step 3: Ensure that the application correctly handles all the functionalities from the original Angular code.
**Pass**: The application handles functionalities such as setting and updating page fields, managing user data, and handling API requests. The `PageForm` component includes logic for handling local storage, form inputs, and API interactions.

## Step 4: Verify that all functionalities like save, delete, update, and tag management are working correctly.
**Pass**: The `PageForm` component includes functions for saving, deleting, and updating pages. Tag management is handled through the `handleTagChange` and `handleSelectSuggestion` functions, which update the state and interact with the API.

## Step 5: Ensure that the application performs all CRUD operations correctly.
**Pass**: The application performs CRUD operations through the `restApi` service. The `handleSavePage`, `handleDeletePage`, and other functions in `PageForm` correctly implement the logic for creating, reading, updating, and deleting content.

## Step 6: Verify that the application handles local storage and state persistence correctly.
**Pass**: The application handles local storage through functions like `handleLocalVersion` and `handleDeleteNewerVersion`, which manage the local storage of page data. State persistence is managed through Redux Toolkit and the `useAppSelector` and `useAppDispatch` hooks.
