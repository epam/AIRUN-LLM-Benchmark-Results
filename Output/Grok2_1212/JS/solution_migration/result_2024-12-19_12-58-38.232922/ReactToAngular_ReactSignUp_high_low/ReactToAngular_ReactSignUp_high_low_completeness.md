# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Verify that all React components and their functionalities are correctly translated into Angular components.
- **Pass**: The React components have been translated into Angular components. The `SignupComponent`, `FormGroupComponent`, and services are correctly implemented.

### Step 2: Ensure that the form validation logic is implemented using Angular reactive forms.
- **Pass**: The form validation logic is implemented using Angular reactive forms in `signup.component.ts`.

### Step 3: Check that the application includes the necessary form controls and validation rules.
- **Pass**: The application includes the necessary form controls and validation rules in `signup.component.ts`.

### Step 4: Confirm that the application correctly binds the form controls and handles form submission.
- **Pass**: The form controls are correctly bound using `formGroup` and `formControlName` directives. Form submission is handled in the `onSubmit` method.

### Step 5: Ensure the application correctly displays form validation errors.
- **Pass**: The `FormGroupComponent` correctly displays form validation errors using the `getErrorMessage` method.

### Step 6: Verify that the application contains actions for signup, signup success, and signup failure.
- **Pass**: The `auth.actions.ts` file contains the `signupComplete` action. However, actions for signup failure are not explicitly mentioned.

### Step 7: Ensure that the `auth.effects.ts` file correctly handles side effects using @ngrx/effects, including calling the API and dispatching success or failure actions.
- **Fail**: The `auth.effects.ts` file is not provided in the given code. Therefore, side effects handling using @ngrx/effects cannot be verified.

### Step 8: Validate that the API call to signup is correctly integrated and that the response is handled properly.
- **Pass**: The API call to signup is integrated in `signup.service.ts` and the response is handled using RxJS operators.

### Step 9: Confirm that the application navigates to the login page correctly when the link is clicked.
- **Pass**: The application navigates to the login page correctly using the `routerLink` directive in `signup.component.html`.
