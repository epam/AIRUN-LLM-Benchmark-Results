# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that the main component displays the header with input for new todos.
**Pass**: The `app.component.html` contains a header with an input field for new todos.

### Step 2: Ensure that adding a new todo item works correctly.
**Pass**: The `addTodo` method in `app.component.ts` dispatches the `addTodo` action, and the `todoReducer` handles this action to add a new todo item.

### Step 3: Verify that the todo list displays all added todo items.
**Pass**: The `todo-list.component.html` uses `*ngFor` to iterate over the todos and display them using the `app-todo-item` component.

### Step 4: Confirm that toggle functionality works for marking todos as completed.
**Fail**: The `toggleTodo` action is defined in `todo.actions.ts`, but the `toggleTodo` method is missing in `todo-item.component.ts` to dispatch this action.

### Step 5: Check that editing a todo item works and updates the todo item correctly.
**Pass**: The `editTodo` and `saveTodo` methods in `todo-list.component.ts` handle editing and saving todo items, and the corresponding actions are dispatched and handled by the reducer.

### Step 6: Ensure that deleting a todo item removes it from the list.
**Pass**: The `destroyTodo` method in `todo-list.component.ts` dispatches the `destroyTodo` action, and the `todoReducer` handles this action to remove the todo item.

### Step 7: Verify that the footer correctly displays the count of active items.
**Pass**: The `todo-footer.component.ts` correctly calculates and displays the count of active items.

### Step 8: Confirm that the footer's clear completed button works and removes completed items.
**Pass**: The `clearCompleted` method in `app.component.ts` dispatches the `clearCompleted` action, and the `todoReducer` handles this action to remove completed items.

### Step 9: Check that filtering todos by "all", "active", and "completed" works correctly.
**Pass**: The `setNowShowing` method in `todo-list.component.ts` sets the filter, and the `todo-list.component.html` uses this filter to display the correct todos.

### Step 10: Ensure that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works correctly.
**Pass**: The `toggleAll` method in `app.component.ts` dispatches the `toggleAll` action, and the `todoReducer` handles this action to mark all todos as complete.

### Step 11: Check that the application persists todos to local storage and reloads them correctly.
**Pass**: The `TodoEffects` class in `todo.effects.ts` handles saving todos to local storage and reloading them.
