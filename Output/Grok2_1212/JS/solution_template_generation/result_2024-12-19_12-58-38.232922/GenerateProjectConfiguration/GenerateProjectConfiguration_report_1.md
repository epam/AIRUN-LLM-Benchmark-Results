Your task is to create a project configuration based on the Vite builder with support for React, Redux, React-Router, TypeScript, and testing library.

When generating the code, ensure to adhere to the instructions below:
- Describe the provided commands.
- Provide a package.json file.
- The generated code should not contain any TODOs.
- Simply return the codebase without additional comments within the code.

### Answer:
To create a project configuration based on Vite with support for React, Redux, React-Router, TypeScript, and testing library, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the project using Vite:**
   The command to initialize a new Vite project with React and TypeScript is:
   ```
   npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react-ts
   ```
   This command creates a new directory named `my-react-app` with a basic Vite + React + TypeScript setup.

2. **Install necessary dependencies:**
   After initializing the project, we need to install additional dependencies for Redux, React-Router, and testing. The command to do this is:
   ```
   cd my-react-app
   npm install react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit react-router-dom @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
   ```
   This command installs Redux, React-Router, and the testing libraries required for the project.

3. **Update package.json:**
   We'll need to update the `package.json` file to include scripts for starting the development server, building the project, and running tests.

Here's the updated `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "my-react-app",
  "private": true,
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "tsc && vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "test": "vitest"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "react-redux": "^8.0.5",
    "react-router-dom": "^6.10.0",
    "@reduxjs/toolkit": "^1.9.3"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.16.5",
    "@testing-library/react": "^13.4.0",
    "@types/react": "^18.0.28",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18.0.11",
    "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^3.1.0",
    "typescript": "^4.9.4",
    "vite": "^4.2.1",
    "vitest": "^0.29.8"
  }
}
```

This `package.json` file includes all the necessary dependencies and scripts for development, building, and testing the application.

The `dev` script starts the development server using Vite. The `build` script compiles TypeScript and then builds the project for production. The `preview` script allows you to preview the production build locally. The `test` script runs tests using Vitest, which is compatible with Vite and supports the testing libraries we've installed.

With these steps and the provided `package.json`, you have a fully configured Vite project with React, Redux, React-Router, TypeScript, and testing library support.
