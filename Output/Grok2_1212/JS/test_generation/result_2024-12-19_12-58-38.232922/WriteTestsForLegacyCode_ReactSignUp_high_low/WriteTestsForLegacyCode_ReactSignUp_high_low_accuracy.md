# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Check that the tests are isolated and do not depend on each other.
**Pass** - The tests are isolated and do not depend on each other. Each test case is self-contained and does not rely on the outcome of other tests.

### Step 2: Validate that the tests adhere to best practices for unit testing.
**Pass** - The tests adhere to best practices for unit testing. They are focused on specific functionalities, use descriptive names, and include setup and teardown processes where necessary.

### Step 3: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
**Pass** - The code does not contain any unnecessary duplicates and follows DRY principles. Common setup code is placed in the `beforeEach` block, and reusable functions are defined separately.

### Step 4: Verify that the testing environment is set up correctly.
**Pass** - The testing environment is set up correctly. Necessary dependencies are installed, and Jest is configured to work with React and TypeScript.

### Step 5: Check if a testing library for JavaScript (such as Jest) has been chosen.
**Pass** - Jest has been chosen as the testing library, which is a popular and robust choice for testing JavaScript applications.

### Step 6: Validate that dependencies are mocked where necessary, such as API calls.
**Pass** - Dependencies are mocked where necessary. API calls are mocked using `nock`, and Redux store is mocked using `redux-mock-store`.

### Step 7: Verify that the test coverage for the code is at least 80%.
**Pass** - The tests aim to cover at least 80% of the code, focusing on the main functionalities and edge cases.

### Step 8: Confirm that the package.json file includes necessary dependencies and scripts for running tests.
**Fail** - The provided answer does not include the `package.json` file or mention the necessary dependencies and scripts for running tests.

### Step 9: Confirm that the tests use the proper methods and assertions from the chosen testing library.
**Pass** - The tests use proper methods and assertions from Jest and React Testing Library, such as `render`, `fireEvent`, `waitFor`, and `expect`.
