# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verified that all Angular.js anti-patterns are correctly identified.  
  The answer identifies issues such as a large controller, tightly coupled logic, direct DOM manipulation, and the inappropriate use of $rootScope for notifications.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirmed that architectural issues like tight coupling are accurately highlighted.  
  The analysis points out the mixing of responsibilities in controllers and appropriately recommends extracting business logic into a dedicated service.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensured that performance bottlenecks are correctly identified.  
  The evaluation mentions inefficient data handling practices such as repeated localStorage operations and multiple API calls for extras, and it offers practical code improvements.

- **Pass** (100%): Validated that readability issues are properly assessed.  
  The review clearly notes unclear variable names and complex logic, providing both problematic examples and suggestions for more descriptive naming and modularization.

- **Pass** (100%): Checked that maintainability problems are properly identified.  
  Issues like code duplication, lack of modularity, and tight coupling are well explained with refactoring recommendations (e.g., introducing a PageService).

- **Pass** (100%): Verified that accessibility concerns are correctly pointed out.  
  The evaluation details the absence of ARIA attributes, missing labels, and lack of keyboard navigation support, along with concrete HTML corrections.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensured that specific code examples are provided for each identified issue.  
  Every problematic code snippet is paired with a corrected example, making the recommendations clear and actionable.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirmed that suggestions follow modern Angular.js best practices.  
  The recommendations include the use of services, avoiding $rootScope event broadcasting, and refactoring for separation of concerns, which are consistent with current best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Validated that documentation improvements are appropriately suggested.  
  The analysis points out insufficient comments and suggests JSDoc-style improvements to enhance code clarity.

- **Pass** (100%): Checked that all recommended solutions address the root causes of the issues.  
  Each recommendation not only provides a workaround but also addresses the underlying problem (e.g., refactoring a large controller into smaller functions or a service).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensured the analysis recognizes outdated Angular.js patterns that should be updated.  
  Outdated patterns such as direct DOM manipulation and overuse of $rootScope for event handling are properly identified and alternative methods are recommended.

- **Pass** (100%): Verified that the recommendations are practical and implementable within the existing codebase.  
  The suggestions include specific code revisions and practical steps that developers can adopt to incrementally improve the application.
