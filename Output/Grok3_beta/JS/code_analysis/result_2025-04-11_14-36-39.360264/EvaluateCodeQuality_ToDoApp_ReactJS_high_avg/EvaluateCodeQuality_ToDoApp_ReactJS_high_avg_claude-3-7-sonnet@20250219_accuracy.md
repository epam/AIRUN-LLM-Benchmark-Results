    The evaluation covers routing briefly in section 1.1 mentioning that the TodoApp component handles routing, but doesn't provide a detailed assessment of the routing implementation or suggest specific improvements. It mentions the nowShowing state but doesn't fully analyze how the routing is implemented or what might be improved with modern routing libraries or patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that code examples provided for improvements are technically correct
