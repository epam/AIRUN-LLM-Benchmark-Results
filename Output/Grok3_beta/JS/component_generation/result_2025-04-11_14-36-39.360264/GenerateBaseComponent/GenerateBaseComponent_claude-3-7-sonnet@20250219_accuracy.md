# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x
  
  The component imports from React and uses hooks like useState, useEffect, useRef, and useCallback, which are compatible with React 18.x. The code structure follows modern React patterns compatible with React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
  
  The code uses TypeScript with proper interfaces (Option, SearchableSelectProps), type annotations for function parameters and returns, and typed refs (useRef<HTMLDivElement>). React.FC type is used for the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling
  
  The solution includes an index.css file with comprehensive styling for the searchable select component.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments
  
  The code is well-structured, properly formatted, and contains no TODO comments. It includes proper documentation and follows best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility
  
  The component properly manages state using useState hooks for isOpen, searchTerm, selectedValue, and focusedIndex, ensuring appropriate state updates throughout the component lifecycle.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props
  
  The component accepts props through a well-defined interface (SearchableSelectProps) including options, defaultValue, placeholder, onChange callback, and ariaLabel, making it highly customizable.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection
  
  The component implements comprehensive keyboard navigation through the handleKeyDown function, supporting Enter, Escape, ArrowDown, and ArrowUp keys with appropriate behaviors for each.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions
  
  The code utilizes useRef appropriately for container, input, and list elements, and handles DOM interactions in a React-friendly way, using refs for focus management and DOM measurements.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques
  
  Focus management is well-handled through useEffect hooks that focus the input when the dropdown opens and scroll focused items into view when navigating with the keyboard.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
  
  The component includes extensive ARIA attributes including role="combobox", aria-expanded, aria-controls, aria-label, role="searchbox", role="listbox", role="option", and aria-selected to ensure screen reader compatibility.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  There's a circular dependency in the `handleKeyDown` function that references `handleSelect` before it's defined. This would cause a runtime error. The function should be moved before `handleKeyDown` or converted to a useCallback definition that includes handleSelect in its dependencies.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component
  
  The component properly uses useCallback for functions and dependencies are correctly specified in hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
