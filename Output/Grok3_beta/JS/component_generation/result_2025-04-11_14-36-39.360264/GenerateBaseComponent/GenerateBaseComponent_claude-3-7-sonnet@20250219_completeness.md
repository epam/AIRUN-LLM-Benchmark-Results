    The component does implement the Enter key functionality to open the dropdown when the component is focused, as shown in the handleKeyDown function case for 'Enter'. However, there appears to be a small issue in the code - the handleSelect function is referenced in the dependencies array of useCallback but is defined after this reference, which could potentially cause issues. This might be a minor oversight in the implementation, but the intended functionality is clearly present.
