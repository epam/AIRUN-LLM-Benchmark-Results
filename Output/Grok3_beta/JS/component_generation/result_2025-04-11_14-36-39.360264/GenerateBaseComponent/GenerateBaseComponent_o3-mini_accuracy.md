# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (95%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  The implementation uses modern React features such as functional components and hooks, which are standard in React 18.x. Although the code does not explicitly note the React version, its style and APIs are consistent with React 18.x usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  The component file "SearchableSelect.tsx" has clearly defined interfaces for props and options, and type annotations are consistently used throughout.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  The provided solution includes an "index.css" file that defines styling for the component, ensuring that styles are separated from the logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  The code is clean and well-commented, containing no TODO comments or unfinished code segments, suggesting it is production-ready.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  State management is handled via React’s useState hook for tracking the open/closed state, the selected value, the search term, and the focused index, which is appropriate for this component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  The component accepts a variety of props—options, defaultValue, placeholder, onChange, ariaLabel—making it customizable and reusable in different contexts.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  The component defines an onKeyDown handler that manages keyboard navigation using Arrow keys, Enter, and Escape, which aligns with accessibility and usability best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  Refs are appropriately used (e.g., containerRef, inputRef, listRef) and are managed via React’s useRef hook. Event listeners (like for detecting clicks outside) are correctly added and cleaned up.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  When the dropdown opens, focus is moved to the search input, and after selection, it is returned to the input. This demonstrates good focus management. There is a slight room for improvement by possibly memoizing the selection handler, but overall the focus management is implemented correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  The component includes ARIA roles and attributes (e.g., role="combobox", aria-expanded, aria-controls, role="searchbox", etc.), ensuring that it is accessible for screen readers and adheres to accessibility standards.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  Although static analysis cannot guarantee the absence of runtime warnings or errors, the code is well structured and does not exhibit obvious issues that typically lead to console warnings. There is moderate confidence here because only runtime testing can fully confirm this.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  The component uses useCallback for memoizing certain functions (like filteredOptions) and relies on hooks appropriately to minimize re-renders. One minor observation is that the handleSelect function is defined normally rather than memoized; however, its usage within event handlers does not appear to lead to unnecessary re-renders in the current setup. This yields a high, though not absolute, confidence level.
