# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component renders a container (with class "searchable-select") that includes a visible trigger. When the dropdown is toggled open (controlled by the state "isOpen"), a div with the class "dropdown" is rendered with the list of options. This confirms the presence of a dropdown select UI element.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  Within the dropdown (rendered when "isOpen" is true), the component includes an input element (with class "search-input") that is used for searching/filtering the provided options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The component maintains a single selection through the state variable "selectedValue". When an option is clicked (or selected via keyboard), the "handleSelect" function updates this state, ensuring only one item is selected at a time.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The onKeyDown handler in the component handles both the "ArrowDown" and "ArrowUp" keys, updating the "focusedIndex" so that users can navigate through the list of filtered options via the keyboard.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  Within the onKeyDown event, when the "Enter" key is pressed and the dropdown is open with a valid focused item, the code calls "handleSelect" with the selected optionâ€™s value. This verifies that items can indeed be selected with the Enter key.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  The onKeyDown handler toggles the dropdown: if the dropdown is not open, pressing Enter will set isOpen to true, and if it is open with no valid focused option, it toggles on Enter. This meets the requirement of toggling visibility with the Enter key.

- **Fail** (80%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  The implementation does explicitly call "inputRef.current?.focus()" after an item is selected via the handleSelect function, which returns focus to the search input inside the dropdown. However, when the dropdown is closed by pressing the Escape key or by clicking outside, there is no explicit mechanism to ensure that focus returns to the select container (the parent div, which is focusable via tabIndex=0). This may lead to inconsistent focus management after closing in some scenarios. Hence, this step is marked as a failure, though there is partial handling on selection via keyboard/mouse.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  Each list item (option) has an onClick event that calls handleSelect. This function sets "isOpen" to false, thereby closing the dropdown when a user selects an item by clicking.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  When navigating with the keyboard and selecting an item by pressing Enter, the onKeyDown handler calls handleSelect, which similarly closes the dropdown by setting "isOpen" to false.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  The onKeyDown handler includes a case for the Escape key that calls setIsOpen(false) and prevents the default behavior, ensuring that the dropdown properly closes when Escape is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  A useEffect hook attaches an event listener for mousedown events. If a click occurs outside of the component's container (as determined by the containerRef), the dropdown is closed. This confirms the correct behavior for closing on outside clicks.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  The onKeyDown handler checks for the Enter key and toggles the dropdown open when the component is in focus. This behavior meets the requirement that the dropdown should open upon an Enter key press when focused.
