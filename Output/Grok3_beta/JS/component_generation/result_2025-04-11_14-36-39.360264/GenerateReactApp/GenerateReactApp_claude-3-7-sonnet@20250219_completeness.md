# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The application fetches characters from the SWAPI endpoint (`https://swapi.dev/api/people`) and displays them using the `CharacterList` component. The `App.tsx` file contains the appropriate fetching logic with Axios, and the retrieved data is passed to the character list component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The application shows a loading spinner during API calls. This is implemented in the `App.tsx` file through a condition that checks the `loading` state and displays a spinner animation with "Loading characters..." text when true.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The application displays all characters that are retrieved from the API response by mapping through the `characters` array in the `CharacterList` component and rendering each character name.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  The application does not include any search functionality or user input fields. It simply fetches and displays the Star Wars characters without any filtering or search capability.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character is displayed with its name in a list item. The `CharacterList` component maps through the characters array and renders each character's name within a list item.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The application structure is consistent with Create React App, including the typical file organization and dependencies. The package.json file includes the standard scripts and dependencies for a Create React App project.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The application implements proper state management using React's useState hook for three main states:
  - `characters`: to store the list of Star Wars characters
  - `loading`: to track the loading state during API calls
  - `error`: to handle and display error messages

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each character list item has a unique key attribute using the character's URL, which ensures optimal rendering performance in React:
  ```jsx
  <li key={character.url} className="character-item">
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  The application properly handles empty data states. The `CharacterList` component checks if the characters array is empty and displays a "No characters found" message in that case:
  ```jsx
  if (characters.length === 0) {
    return <p className="no-results">No characters found.</p>;
  }
  ```
