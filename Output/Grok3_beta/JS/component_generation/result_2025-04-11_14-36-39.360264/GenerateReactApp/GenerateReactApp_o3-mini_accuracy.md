# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses React 18.x or newer by checking the package.json dependencies  
  The package.json lists "react": "^18.2.0", which confirms that the application uses React 18.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that TypeScript is properly implemented with appropriate type definitions for all components, props, and states  
  All components and props (e.g., in App.tsx and CharacterList.tsx) have explicit TypeScript definitions, and a tsconfig.json file is provided to enforce strict type checking.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Axios is used for API requests to fetch data from the Star Wars API endpoint  
  The code makes use of Axios (imported in App.tsx) to perform the GET request to the SWAPI endpoint.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles API errors gracefully with appropriate error states or messages  
  The Axios call is wrapped in a try-catch block. In case of an error, the error message is stored in the state and displayed in the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the character data is fetched on component mount using useEffect hook  
  The useEffect hook in App.tsx is used to call the fetchCharacters function upon component mount.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application properly manages component rendering optimization  
  The CharacterList component is wrapped with React.memo, which helps prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows React best practices using hooks appropriately  
  The code correctly employs useState and useEffect for state management and side effects, adhering to React best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't contain any TODO comments or unnecessary code  
  The provided code does not include any TODO comments or extraneous code segments.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the codebase has minimal comments that only clarify complex logic when necessary  
  The comments present are minimal and focus on explaining the setup and purpose of code segments without redundancy.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the API endpoint 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' is being called correctly  
  The Axios GET request in App.tsx correctly targets 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' for fetching Star Wars character data.

- **Fail** (80%): Verify that the application renders without console errors or warnings  
  The implementation uses <style jsx>{`...`}</style> for styling within React components. While this approach is common in frameworks like Next.js, Create React App does not natively support styled-jsx without additional configuration or dependencies. This might lead to console warnings or errors unless the project is explicitly set up for styled-jsx. (The 80% confidence reflects that if the project were configured for styled-jsx, this step would pass, but based solely on the provided package.json, such configuration appears missing.)
