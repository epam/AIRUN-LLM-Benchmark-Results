# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The application fetches data from SWAPI using Axios and renders the characters through the CharacterList component. This confirms that the list is displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  When the API call is in progress, the component renders a loading container with a spinner animation and a "Loading characters..." message.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  The fetched characters are stored in state and passed to the CharacterList component, where each character's name is displayed in a list item.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  The implementation focuses solely on fetching and displaying the Star Wars characters; there is no code for search functionality or additional user inputs.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each list item in the CharacterList component uses character.name, ensuring that each entry is properly rendered with the correct data.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The provided package.json, tsconfig.json, and overall file structure indicate that the project was set up using Create React App with the TypeScript template.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The App component utilizes useState hooks to manage loading, error, and characters state, effectively handling various UI states.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  In the CharacterList component, each list item uses character.url as its key, ensuring uniqueness and optimal rendering performance.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  The CharacterList component checks if the characters array is empty and displays a "No characters found." message if no data is available.
