# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type  
  The onChange handler (handleSearchChange) is implemented correctly, updating the searchQuery state as the user types.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls  
  A debounced function is created using lodash.debounce with a 500ms delay, which falls within the 300-500ms range.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured  
  The code imports axios and uses it for making API requests with the correct TypeScript generic for responses.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses  
  Interfaces for Character and ApiResponse are defined, and TypeScript types are correctly applied to state variables, props, and event handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters  
  The API URL conditionally adds a search query parameter using encodeURIComponent, ensuring the endpoint aligns with SWAPI's requirements.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate  
  useMemo is used for both the debounced search function and character list rendering; useCallback is used for the search input handler, reducing unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback  
  The code properly uses try-catch blocks to handle errors. It distinguishes between a 404 error (no characters found) and other errors, updating error state accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing  
  Debouncing ensures that API calls are only made after the user has stopped typing for 500ms.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices  
  useState and useEffect hooks are implemented correctly for managing the searchQuery, characters, loading, and error states.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code  
  The provided code is clean, with all imports used effectively and without extraneous or commented-out sections.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests  
  The loading state is set to true before API calls and reset to false within the finally block, ensuring accurate feedback during data fetching.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns  
  The code follows modern React patterns with functional components, hooks, and an Error Boundary for handling runtime errors.
