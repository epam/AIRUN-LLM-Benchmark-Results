# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The input field is clearly implemented with the placeholder "Search characters..." and its onChange event triggers updating of the search query and API calls, confirming it filters characters by name.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  The code uses a state variable "loading" which, when set to true, displays a loading message ("Loading...") in the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  The useEffect hook calls debouncedSearch with an empty query on mount, ensuring initial data is loaded properly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  The onChange handler, combined with `lodash.debounce`, ensures that as users type, the search query is updated and API calls are made accordingly for dynamic result updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  The component conditionally renders a message "No characters found matching ..." when there is no error, loading is false, and the characters array is empty with a non-empty search query.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The component uses Tailwind CSS classes (like "max-w-2xl", "mx-auto", and responsive padding) which promote a responsive layout. Although the responsiveness relies on Tailwind's configuration, the implementation appears solid given the context.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  When the API call successfully retrieves data, the results are stored in the "characters" state and then rendered in a memoized list, confirming that search results are displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  An error boundary component (CharacterListErrorBoundary) is provided to catch runtime errors and display a fallback UI, ensuring robust error handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The code defines interfaces for `Character` and `ApiResponse`, and component props are properly typed using React.FC, ensuring type safety for API responses and component usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The implementation includes both the default data loading (initial API call) and additional search functionalities. The UI displays characters, loading states, error messages, and supports debounced search without disrupting the core behavior.
