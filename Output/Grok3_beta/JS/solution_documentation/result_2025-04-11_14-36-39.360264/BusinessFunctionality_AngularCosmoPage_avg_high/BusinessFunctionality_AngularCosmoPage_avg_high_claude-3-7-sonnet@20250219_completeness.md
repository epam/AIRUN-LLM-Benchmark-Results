- **Pass** (90%): Verify the documentation explains the theme-specific page types feature
  
  The documentation mentions the page type selector and describes it as a "Dropdown to choose the page type from available theme pages," but doesn't go into extensive detail about how different theme pages might function or what specific options might be available.

- **Fail** (80%): Confirm the documentation describes the featured image handling
  
  While the documentation comprehensively covers most aspects of the application, it does not specifically mention or describe featured image handling functionality. This appears to be a missing element in the documentation.
