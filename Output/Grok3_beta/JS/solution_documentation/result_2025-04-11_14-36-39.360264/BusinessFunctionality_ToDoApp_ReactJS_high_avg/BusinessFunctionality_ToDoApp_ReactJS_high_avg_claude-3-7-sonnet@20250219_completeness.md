- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the editing functionality triggered by double-clicking
  
  The document explicitly mentions that editing is triggered by double-clicking in section 2.1: "Users double-click a task label to edit its description, type a new value, and press Enter or click outside to save."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the clear completed functionality
  
  The clear completed functionality is covered in section 1.1 under "Bulk Operations" and section 2.1 under "Clearing Completed Tasks," explaining that users can click a "Clear completed" button in the footer to remove all completed tasks.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the counter for remaining items
  
  The document mentions the counter for remaining items in section 2.1 where it refers to "task statistics (active/completed counts)" displayed in the footer component.

  Section 4 "Constraints and Assumptions" details technical limitations (local storage dependency, no backend), architectural assumptions, and dependencies/external requirements.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the document covers the pluralization of item/items text based on count
  
  The document indirectly references pluralization in section 1.2 where it mentions the Utils module providing "helper functions for UUID generation, pluralization, local storage management, and object extension."
