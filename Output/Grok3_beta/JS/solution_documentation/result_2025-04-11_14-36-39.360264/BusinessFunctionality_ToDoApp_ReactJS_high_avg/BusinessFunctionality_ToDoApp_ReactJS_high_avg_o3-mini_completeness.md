# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): The document covers all main functionality including adding, editing, deleting, and toggling todos.  
  The analysis details task creation (“Adding a Task”), editing (“Editing a Task”), deletion (“Deleting a Task”), and toggling completion (“Toggling Task Completion”) with appropriate code references.

- **Pass** (100%): The document includes information about filtering todos by status (all, active, completed).  
  It clearly explains task filtering through routing and UI components and outlines how navigation links in the footer are used for filtering.

- **Pass** (100%): The document describes the user workflow for creating new todo items.  
  The “User Interaction Patterns” section elaborates on creating todos, emphasizing focus management, auto-focus of the input field, and using the Enter key for submission.

- **Pass** (100%): The document covers the editing functionality triggered by double-clicking.  
  It explains that users double-click a task label to initiate editing and provides details about processing changes (handled by relevant methods in the TodoItem component).

- **Pass** (100%): The document includes information about the clear completed functionality.  
  There is a dedicated explanation outlining how completed tasks can be removed (“Clearing Completed Tasks”) including reference to the associated function (`clearCompleted`).

- **Pass** (100%): The document describes the toggle all functionality.  
  It details the toggle-all feature under “Bulk Operations” and explains how checking/unchecking a global checkbox marks all tasks as complete/incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): The document covers the counter for remaining items.  
  The TodoFooter component and related sections are described, emphasizing the display of task statistics including active (remaining) items.

- **Pass** (100%): The document includes information about the persistent storage of todos.  
  It mentions that tasks are stored in local storage (via `Utils.store` and the TodoModel) to ensure persistence across sessions.

- **Pass** (100%): The document describes the UI components and their relationships.  
  It provides a clear breakdown of components such as TodoApp, TodoItem, TodoFooter, TodoModel, and Utils, and explains how they interact.

- **Pass** (100%): The document covers the business objectives addressed by the application.  
  Primary goals (task organization and user productivity) as well as secondary objectives (persistence and accessibility) are clearly discussed.

- **Pass** (100%): The document includes performance and scalability considerations.  
  It details performance optimizations (like shouldComponentUpdate), scalability limitations (localStorage, in-memory arrays), and efficiency concerns.

- **Pass** (100%): The document describes technical constraints and limitations.  
  Limitations such as dependency on localStorage, absence of a backend, and reliance on an external Router library are well outlined.

- **Pass** (100%): The document covers the pluralization of item/items text based on count.  
  It mentions that the Utils module includes helper functions for pluralization, which is part of the design to display item counts correctly.
