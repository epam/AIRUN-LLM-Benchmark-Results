# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props
  
  All components in the code use TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props. For example, `PageActionsProps` interface defines the prop types for the `PageActions` component, and various type definitions like `PageData` and `UserData` are properly implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management
  
  The code uses Redux Toolkit with `createSlice` for state management. Both `pageSlice.ts` and `userSlice.ts` use the `createSlice` function to create reducers with actions, and the store is configured using `configureStore`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components
  
  All components are implemented as functional components using the React.FC type. For example, `PageEditor`, `PageActions`, and `PageForm` are all functional components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately
  
  React hooks are used appropriately throughout the code. For example, `useState` is used to manage local component state, `useEffect` for side effects, and `useCallback` for memoizing functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource
  
  API communication is implemented using axios in `api/services.ts`, replacing the Angular $resource.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components
  
  Form handling in the `PageForm` component uses controlled components, where input values are bound to state and updated through onChange handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation
  
  React Router is implemented for navigation with `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, and `Route` components in `App.tsx`, and `useNavigate` and `useParams` hooks are used in the `PageEditor` component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization
  
  The code uses the i18next library with react-i18next for internationalization, as seen in the `i18n/index.ts` file and the use of the `useTranslation` hook in components.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization
  
  The code does not implement code splitting using React.lazy and Suspense for performance optimization. There are no imports using React.lazy or Suspense components to indicate code splitting.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations
  
  React.memo is used appropriately to memoize components and prevent unnecessary re-renders, as seen in `PageEditor`, `PageActions`, and `PageForm` components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks
  
  Proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks. For example, in the `PageEditor` component, the useEffect hook that loads page data has [url, dispatch] as its dependency array.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models
  
  TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models, including `PageData`, `UserData`, `ButtonProps`, `PageActionsProps`, and `ApiResponse`.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state
  
  Redux selectors are used to access state through the useSelector hook, as seen in the `PageEditor` and `PageForm` components where they select state from the Redux store.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations
  
  Proper action creators are implemented for state mutations, exported from the Redux slices, such as `setPageData`, `updateField`, and `resetPage`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks
  
  Local storage functionality is implemented using an appropriate custom hook `useLocalStorage` in `hooks/useLocalStorage.ts`, which abstracts the localStorage API and integrates with React's state system.
