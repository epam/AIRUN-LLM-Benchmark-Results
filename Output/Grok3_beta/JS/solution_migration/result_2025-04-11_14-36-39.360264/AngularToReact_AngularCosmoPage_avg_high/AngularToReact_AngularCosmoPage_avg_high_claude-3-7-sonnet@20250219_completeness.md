# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented
  
  The solution includes all required page management functionality. The PageEditor component handles creating, updating, and deleting pages. The duplicate functionality is also implemented in the PageActions component through the savePage action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present
  
  Page type selection is implemented in the PageForm component with a select element that maps through pageData.themePages.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists
  
  URL auto-generation from title is implemented in the handleTitleChange function in PageForm, which creates a URL from the title by converting to lowercase, replacing spaces with hyphens, and removing special characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented
  
  Tag management with autocomplete suggestions is fully implemented. The code includes tag input, autocompletion via the handleAutocompleteTags function, and suggestion selection with handleSelectSuggestion.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available
  
  All three publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are implemented as radio buttons in the PageForm component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented
  
  Scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented with a conditional datetime-local input that appears when the 'schedule' option is selected.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present
  
  Local storage version comparison and restoration is implemented in the PageEditor component with the checkLocalStorage, handleLocalVersion, and handleDeleteNewerVersion functions.

- **Fail** (90%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented
  
  The code doesn't include an explicit notification system for success/error messages. While there are translations for success and error messages (`page_created`, `page_updated`, `page_error_saving`, etc.), the solution doesn't show how these would be displayed to the user.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present
  
  While the solution includes translations for validation messages (`page_no_type_selected`, `page_no_url`), it doesn't show explicit form validation implementation that would check these fields and display the error messages.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled
  
  All API endpoints are properly implemented in the apiService object, including content, contentExtras, contentTags, contentRevisions, contentRevisionsExtras, and users endpoints.

- **Fail** (80%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented
  
  While the apiService includes methods for extras management (save and delete), the UI components don't show how users would interact with these extras. The PageData interface includes an extras property, but there's no UI for managing these extras.

- **Fail** (80%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained
  
  The API services for revision management are included, but the UI implementation for viewing and managing revisions is not present in the provided code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components
  
  The code is well-organized into feature folders with clear separation of concerns. Business logic is in slices and services, while UI components are in the components directory.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved
  
  Translation functionality is preserved using i18next and react-i18next. The code includes the `useTranslation` hook and translation keys for all UI text.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters
  
  The application maintains the same URL structure with React Router, including the /:url parameter for page editing and the /new route for creating new pages.
