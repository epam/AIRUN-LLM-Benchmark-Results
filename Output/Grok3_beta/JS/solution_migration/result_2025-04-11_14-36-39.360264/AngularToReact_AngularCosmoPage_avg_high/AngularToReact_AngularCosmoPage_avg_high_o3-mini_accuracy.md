# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props  
  All components, state definitions, and functions have been properly typed using TypeScript interfaces and function parameter type annotations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management  
  Both page and user state slices are created using createSlice from @reduxjs/toolkit, ensuring modern Redux patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components  
  All components are implemented as React functional components using React.FC and hooks.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately  
  The code utilizes useState, useEffect, and useCallback effectively. Although useMemo is not explicitly used, its usage was not necessary given the current performance requirements. Hence, the hook usage is overall appropriate.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource  
  The code employs axios for API communication, which meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components  
  The form inputs in PageForm are controlled components with their values driven by React state and proper onChange handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation  
  The App component uses BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route to set up navigation between pages.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization  
  The implementation uses i18next along with react-i18next for internationalization, meeting the requirement.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization  
  There is no evidence of code splitting (e.g., React.lazy and Suspense) to lazy-load components or routes, which is a common performance optimization technique.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations  
  Components such as Button, PageEditor, PageActions, and PageForm are wrapped in React.memo, which helps prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks  
  Dependency arrays are provided in useEffect and useCallback hooks. Although they appear mostly correct, there is a slight concern in PageEditor where localStorage checks occur after state updates. However, this does not significantly impact functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models  
  The data models for page and user are clearly defined using TypeScript interfaces in separate files.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state  
  The useSelector hook is used to properly access the Redux storeâ€™s state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations  
  Action creators from createSlice (e.g., setPageData, updateField, resetPage, setUserData, resetUser) are correctly defined and used to mutate state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks  
  A custom hook (useLocalStorage) has been implemented for local storage. Although PageEditor directly interacts with localStorage for some operations, the existence of a dedicated hook fulfills the requirement for managing local storage.
