# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (95%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
  The delete functionality is clearly implemented via the handleDeletePage function, and retrieval for editing is handled through the API call in the useEffect hook. However, duplicate and save actions are referenced (via dispatch(savePage(true)) and dispatch(savePage(false))) without an accompanying implementation in the pageSlice or elsewhere. This incomplete implementation leaves page management functionality only partially implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
  The PageForm component includes a select element populated from pageData.themePages, allowing the user to select a page type.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
  In the PageForm component, the handleTitleChange callback auto-generates the URL based on the title when autoUrl is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
  The PageForm component implements an autocomplete mechanism. It triggers an API call when tags are updated and displays suggestions that can be selected by the user.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
  The form presents radio buttons for "publish", "draft", and "schedule" options, clearly covering the required publish status functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
  When the "schedule" option is selected, a datetime-local input is rendered, allowing the user to specify the scheduled publish date.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
  The PageEditor component employs functions (checkLocalStorage, handleLocalVersion, handleDeleteNewerVersion) to compare, restore, or discard local storage changes based on the URL, providing version handling functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
  Although various i18n keys for messages such as "saved", "page_error_saving", and "deleted" are present, there is no implementation of a notification system (e.g., toast messages or alert pop-ups) in the provided React code that shows success or error feedback to the user.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
  While the page type select includes a required attribute and there is some minimal handling, explicit validation and corresponding error messages (for example, for the URL field) are not clearly implemented. More robust client-side validation or user feedback appears to be missing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
  The apiService file includes all key endpoints (for content, contentExtras, contentTags, contentRevisions, and contentRevisionsExtras) mirroring the original Angular code functionality.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
  Although the PageData state and the apiService include support for "extras", no dedicated UI controls exist in the components to manage or edit extras. Therefore, this functionality is only partially addressed.

- **Fail** (90%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
  The apiService includes endpoints for contentRevisions and contentRevisionsExtras, suggesting intended support for revision history. However, no component or clear workflow utilizing these revision endpoints is provided in the React migration, leaving this functionality incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
  The newly provided project structure organizes code into distinct folders (api, components, features, hooks, i18n, store), fulfilling the requirement of separating business logic from UI components and adopting a clear feature-based architecture.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
  The i18n setup is complete and integrated with the components using the useTranslation hook, ensuring that all text strings obtain translation support similar to the original code.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
  The routing defined in App.tsx uses the same URL structure ("/:url" for page editing and "/new" for creating a new page), closely following the original Angular application's routing parameters.
