# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The component imports FormBuilder and FormGroup from "@angular/forms" and initializes the form reactively.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The signupForm is created with Validators.required, Validators.minLength, and Validators.maxLength for name, and similar synchronous validators for email and password.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  The code uses asynchronous validators based on AuthService methods ("checkNameAvailability" and "checkEmailAvailability") for the name and email fields.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The HTML templates for both signup and form-group components handle error messages and display feedback icons based on the control’s touched and validity states.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  The onSubmit method dispatches the signup action with the form values, integrating with the API via the AuthService and NgRx actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The markup in signup.component.html shows different error messages (e.g., for required, minlength, maxlength, name/email taken) conditionally based on validation errors.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  The implementation does not use Angular’s Title service to set the page title. There is no code related to setting or updating the document title.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The component dispatches actions using NgRx Store, and the code includes a complete integration with NgRx Effects for handling signup side effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button is disabled when the form is invalid or when the "isSubmitting$" observable indicates that a submission is in progress.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  The NgRx effect for signup maps API success to a signupSuccess action and handles errors via catchError to dispatch signupFailure.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component implements OnInit for initialization and OnDestroy for cleanup (e.g., unsubscribing from subscriptions) and separates concerns appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The AuthService uses Angular’s HttpClient for performing API requests, following best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The error messages in the HTML (for required fields, length constraints, and duplicate name/email issues) match the expected validation outputs.
