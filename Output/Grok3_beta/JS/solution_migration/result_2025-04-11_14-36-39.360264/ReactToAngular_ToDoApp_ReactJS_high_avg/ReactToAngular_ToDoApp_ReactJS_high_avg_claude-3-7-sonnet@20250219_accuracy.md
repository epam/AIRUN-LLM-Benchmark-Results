# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The implementation clearly uses Angular framework with typical Angular structures like modules, components, services, and Angular-specific decorators.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
  
  The implementation includes proper NgRx store implementation with imports from '@ngrx/store' and store configuration in the CoreModule.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
  
  The code includes proper implementation of NgRx effects with imports from '@ngrx/effects' and implementation of TodoEffects class for handling side effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
  
  The implementation includes well-structured actions (todo.actions.ts), reducers (todo.reducer.ts), and selectors (todo.selectors.ts) following NgRx best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
  
  All components properly use the @Component decorator, and child components utilize @Input and @Output decorators for proper component communication.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators
  
  React refs are properly replaced with Angular's @ViewChild decorator, as seen in the TodoItemComponent for the edit field reference.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
  
  Components like TodoFooterComponent and TodoItemComponent properly implement @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
  
  The implementation includes the StorageService which handles data persistence logic, properly implemented as an Angular service.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
  
  Dependency injection is properly implemented throughout the application, with services and store being injected through constructors.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
  
  The components use OnPush change detection strategy where appropriate (ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush), which is good for performance optimization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
  
  The implementation includes proper Angular routing with the AppRoutingModule and TodosRoutingModule implementing routes and navigation logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code follows Angular style guide conventions with proper naming, folder structure, and code organization.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
  
  TypeScript interfaces and types are properly defined and used throughout the application, particularly for the Todo model and state interfaces.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
  
  JSX templates are properly converted to Angular HTML templates with appropriate Angular template syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
  
  React event handlers are properly replaced with Angular event bindings such as (click), (change), (keydown), etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs
  
  The code does not contain any TODOs or unimplemented features.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules
  
  Lazy loading is properly implemented for the TodosModule in the app-routing.module.ts file using the loadChildren syntax.
