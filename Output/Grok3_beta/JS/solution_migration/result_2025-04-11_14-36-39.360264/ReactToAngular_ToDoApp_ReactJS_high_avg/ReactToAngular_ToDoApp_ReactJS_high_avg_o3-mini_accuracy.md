# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The instructions and code indicate migration to Angular 14.x, and the imports (e.g., from '@angular/core', '@angular/router') are consistent with Angular practices.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The code clearly sets up state management using StoreModule (e.g., StoreModule.forRoot({ todos: todoReducer })), confirming the use of NgRx Store.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  EffectsModule is imported and configured via EffectsModule.forRoot([TodoEffects]) in the CoreModule, indicating proper usage of NgRx Effects.  

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  The code defines a comprehensive set of actions (e.g., addTodo, toggleTodo), a reducer to handle state changes, and various selectors to query state data, which meets the requirement.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  Components utilize @Component for declaration and properly use @Input and @Output decorators (for example, in TodoFooterComponent and TodoItemComponent).  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  The todo-item.component.ts file shows the use of @ViewChild to reference the input field for editing, replacing the concept of React refs.  

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  Components communicate effectively: properties are passed using @Input() and events are emitted using @Output() (e.g., TodoFooterComponent's clearCompleted emitter).  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  The StorageService demonstrates proper use of an Angular service to handle data persistence via localStorage.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  The example shows proper dependency injection (e.g., injecting Store into components and services, and Actions into effects), meeting Angular best practices.  

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  Several components (such as TodoAppComponent and TodoItemComponent) apply OnPush change detection, optimizing performance as required.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  The application uses RouterModule, defining routes in app-routing.module.ts and todos-routing.module.ts for navigation between views.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code organizes modules, components, services, and state management according to standard Angular conventions, ensuring a maintainable project structure.  

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  Interfaces such as Todo and TodoState are defined and used consistently across the project for type safety.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  All templates are provided as Angular HTML files with proper Angular syntax, replacing any JSX constructs.  

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  The code correctly uses Angular event bindings (e.g., (keydown), (blur), (click)) to manage user interactions instead of React event handling methods.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  A review of the provided code shows no leftover TODO comments; the implementation is complete.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  The use of loadChildren in app-routing.module.ts demonstrates lazy loading of the TodosModule, fulfilling this requirement.
