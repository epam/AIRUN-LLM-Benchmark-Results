# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The TodoAppComponent uses the observable filteredTodos$ to bind the list of todos into the view. Each todo is rendered by the TodoItemComponent, ensuring that all items are displayed correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoAppComponent implements handleNewTodoKeyDown which listens to the ENTER key and dispatches the addTodo action, enabling the addition of new todo items.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  The TodoItemComponent’s handleToggle method dispatches the toggleTodo action, allowing users to mark todos as complete or incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent provides editing capability through methods such as handleEdit and handleSubmit and updates the store via saveTodo and setEditing actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent defines handleDestroy, which dispatches the destroyTodo action to remove a todo item.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  The TodoAppComponent includes a toggleAll method that dispatches the toggleAll action based on the checkbox state, covering this functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  The application sets the filtering behavior via the nowShowing state and corresponding selectors (selectFilteredTodos). Routes and resolver logic set this state appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooterComponent receives the active count via an @Input property and displays this count in the footer.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  In the TodoAppComponent, clearCompleted dispatches the clearCompleted action, and the TodoFooterComponent displays the button conditionally when there are completed items.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  The StorageService implements getTodos to load todos from local storage and saveTodos, which subscribes to the store’s selectAllTodos observable to store changes in local storage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The TodosRoutingModule defines routes for the base, active, and completed paths, preserving the original URL structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  The TodoAppComponent conditionally displays sections (e.g., the main section and footer) based on the presence of todos, handling empty states appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  The new todo input in TodoAppComponent uses Angular’s ngModel binding and keydown event handling to capture and process form submissions when the Enter key is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The application is structured with clear separations between core state management, shared models, features, and routing – preserving proper component and module relationships according to Angular best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  The migration includes identical business logic distributed across actions, reducers, effects, and selectors. All functionality—such as adding, toggling, editing, deleting, and filtering todos—is preserved.
