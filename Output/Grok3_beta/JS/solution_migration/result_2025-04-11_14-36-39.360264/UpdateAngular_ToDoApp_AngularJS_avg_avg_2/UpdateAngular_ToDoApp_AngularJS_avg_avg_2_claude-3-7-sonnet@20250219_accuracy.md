# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
    
    The application clearly uses Angular 14.x as evidenced by the import statements from Angular packages and the modern Angular syntax throughout the code. The component structure, module declarations, and use of decorators all follow Angular 14.x conventions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS
    
    The code consistently uses ES module import/export syntax throughout all files, such as `import { Component } from '@angular/core';` and there is no trace of RequireJS define/require patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management
    
    NgRx Store is properly implemented with imports from '@ngrx/store' in multiple files, and the StoreModule is included in the app.module.ts with `StoreModule.forRoot({ todos: todoReducer })`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects
    
    NgRx Effects is correctly implemented with the import of EffectsModule in app.module.ts and the creation of a TodoEffects class that handles side effects like loading and saving todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management
    
    The implementation includes well-defined actions (loadTodos, addTodo, removeTodo, etc.), a comprehensive reducer with all required operations, properly structured selectors for various data views, and effects for side effects like localStorage operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator
    
    The TodoStorageService has the @Injectable decorator with providedIn: 'root', conforming to Angular's dependency injection system.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service
    
    The TodoStorageService correctly uses localStorage with the specified STORAGE_ID for persisting todo data, implementing both get and save methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators
    
    All components (TodoAppComponent, TodoHeaderComponent, etc.) use the @Component decorator with appropriate metadata including selector, templateUrl, and styleUrls where needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators
    
    Both custom directives (TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective) correctly use the @Directive decorator with appropriate selector metadata.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)
    
    The templates use proper Angular structural directives such as `*ngFor="let todo of todos; trackBy: trackById"` and `*ngIf="(todos$ | async)?.length"`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))
    
    Event binding is correctly implemented throughout the templates, such as `(click)="remove()"`, `(ngSubmit)="doneEditing()"`, and `(change)="toggleCompleted()"`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])
    
    Property binding is properly used, including examples like `[ngClass]="{completed: todo.completed, editing: editing}"` and `[checked]="todo.completed"`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed
    
    Lifecycle hooks are correctly used where appropriate, such as `ngOnInit()` in the TodoAppComponent and `ngOnChanges()` in the TodoFocusDirective.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models
    
    The code defines a clear Todo interface in models/todo.model.ts with proper typing for id, title, and completed properties.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services
    
    Dependency injection is correctly implemented throughout the application, with services and store injected via constructor parameters in components and services.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions
    
    The code follows Angular style guide conventions with proper naming patterns (e.g., kebab
