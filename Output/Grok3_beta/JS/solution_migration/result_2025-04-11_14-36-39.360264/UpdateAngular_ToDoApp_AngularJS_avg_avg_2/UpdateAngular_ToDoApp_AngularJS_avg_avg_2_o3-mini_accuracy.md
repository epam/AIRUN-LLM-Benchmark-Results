# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The answer clearly states the migration to Angular 14.x and the code structure, modules, and imports are consistent with Angular applications built using Angular 14.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
  All modules are imported using ES module syntax (e.g., import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'), and there is no mention or usage of RequireJS.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
  The answer imports and configures StoreModule with a todoReducer in the AppModule, confirming the usage of @ngrx/store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
  The EffectsModule is imported and initialized with TodoEffects. The code provides handlers for side effects, confirming its implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
  The implementation includes clearly defined actions (e.g., loadTodos, addTodo), reducers (todo.reducer.ts), selectors (todo.selectors.ts), and effects (todo.effects.ts), all centered around managing todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
  The TodoStorageService is annotated with @Injectable and provided in the root, ensuring proper dependency injection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
  The TodoStorageService uses localStorage for getting and saving todos, thereby fulfilling data persistence using the browser's storage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
  Each Angular component (e.g., TodoAppComponent, TodoHeaderComponent) uses the @Component decorator with appropriate metadata (selector, templateUrl, styleUrls) to define the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
  Custom directives (todoFocus and todoEscape) are declared with the @Directive decorator and are implemented appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
  The provided HTML templates make use of Angular directives like *ngIf and *ngFor for conditionals and lists.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
  In the templates, events are bound with the proper Angular syntax, e.g., (click)="toggleCompleted()" and (ngSubmit)="addTodoItem()".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
  The components use Angular’s property binding syntax, for example: [ngClass]="{completed: todo.completed, editing: editing}" in the todo-item component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
  Components and directives implement lifecycle hooks appropriately (e.g., ngOnInit in TodoAppComponent and ngOnChanges in TodoFocusDirective).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
  The Todo model is defined as an interface (Todo) in todo.model.ts, ensuring type-safe data structures.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
  Both components and services receive dependencies via their constructors, following Angular’s dependency injection best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code is modularized, uses clear naming conventions, and separates concerns according to component, service, directive, and state management patterns consistent with the Angular style guide.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
  While this evaluation is code-based, the provided implementation adheres to Angular best practices that are likely to prevent common console errors or warnings.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
  The implementation utilizes TypeScript features such as type annotations, interfaces for models, and type-safe actions with props, which conforms to modern TypeScript coding practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
  The code is clean without any commented-out legacy code or TODO markers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design  
  Each component, service, directive, and state manager (actions/reducers/effects) is designed to handle very specific tasks, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and adherence to the single responsibility principle.
