- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list  
  The provided implementation includes a dedicated TodoListComponent that renders the list of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos  
  The TodoHeaderComponent contains an input field and the addTodoItem() method for creating new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos  
  The TodoItemComponent implements editing functionality (e.g., startEditing(), doneEditing(), and revertEditing()).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos  
  The TodoFooterComponent is responsible for filtering todos (All, Active, Completed) based on the URL and user selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics  
  TodoFooterComponent displays the remaining todo count via the remainingCount$ observable.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos  
  The addTodoItem() method in TodoHeaderComponent dispatches an action to add a new todo when the input is non-empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos  
  Editing is supported in TodoItemComponent by dispatching the editTodo action when editing is completed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos  
  The remove() method in TodoItemComponent dispatches the removeTodo action to delete a todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed  
  The toggleCompleted() method in TodoItemComponent dispatches the toggleTodo action to update a todo’s completed state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)  
  The routing strategy in AppModule and the dynamic selection in TodoAppComponent ensure filtering based on the route.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete  
  The toggleAllTodos() method in TodoHeaderComponent dispatches the toggleAll action to update the state of all todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos  
  TodoFooterComponent provides a clearCompletedTodos() method that dispatches the clearCompleted action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos  
  The use of the selectRemainingCount selector and its display in TodoFooterComponent provide the remaining count.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage  
  The TodoStorageService’s save() method writes the todos state to localStorage, ensuring persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization  
  The TodoEffects loadTodos$ effect retrieves persisted todos from localStorage during initialization.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing  
  The todoEscape directive listens for the Escape key and emits an event which is handled (via revertEditing()) in TodoItemComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo  
  The todoFocus directive conditionally sets focus on the input field, as applied in the TodoItemComponent’s editing template.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original  
  The answer indicates that original CSS files (from todomvc-common and todomvc-app-css) are preserved and referenced in angular.json. Although the integration appears correct, final verification of visual parity relies on the proper inclusion and configuration of those CSS assets.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately  
  Both in the addTodoItem() (which trims input) and in doneEditing() (which triggers removal when the input is empty), empty titles are properly managed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter  
  The routing configuration and the navigation logic in TodoFooterComponent and TodoAppComponent ensure that the URL reflects the active filter (All, Active, Completed).
