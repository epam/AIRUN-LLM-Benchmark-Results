# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all React imports use React 18.x compatible syntax
  
  The code correctly uses React 18 syntax throughout, including the modern `ReactDOM.createRoot` API in the main entry point.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all components use functional component syntax with hooks instead of class components
  
  All components are implemented as functional components with React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useRef) instead of class components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Redux Toolkit's createSlice is used for state management
  
  Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` is properly implemented in the todosSlice.ts file with appropriate actions and reducers.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for all props, state, and Redux store
  
  The code includes well-defined TypeScript interfaces for all component props, state structures, and Redux store types.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses immutable state updates in reducers
  
  The Redux Toolkit implementation in todosSlice.ts properly uses immutable state updates in all reducers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that nanoid is used for ID generation instead of custom UUID implementation
  
  The code correctly imports and uses nanoid for generating unique IDs for todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application uses React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate
  
  React.memo is appropriately applied to the TodoList, TodoItem, and TodoFooter components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that useCallback is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  
  The code consistently uses useCallback for event handlers throughout the components with proper dependency arrays.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage handling is implemented in a modern way
  
  The code includes a dedicated localStorage utility with proper error handling and type safety.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows consistent naming conventions throughout the application
  
  The code maintains consistent naming conventions: camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for components, and descriptive names throughout.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper error handling is implemented where necessary
  
  Error handling is implemented where needed, particularly in the localStorage utility functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware
  
  The Redux store is properly configured using configureStore with appropriate reducers and default middleware.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that React.lazy is used for code splitting where appropriate
  
  There is no implementation of React.lazy for code splitting anywhere in the provided code. For a small application like this, code splitting might not be necessary, but the evaluation step specifically requires checking for React.lazy implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the codebase has no TODOs remaining
  
  The code doesn't contain any TODO comments and appears to be complete.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux Provider wraps the application entry point
  
  The Redux Provider correctly wraps the App component in the main entry point (index.tsx).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure strict TypeScript type checking is implemented throughout the application
  
  TypeScript types are used consistently throughout the application, including proper typing for state, props, event handlers, and Redux store.
