# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed
  
  The implementation correctly handles the Enter key in the `TodoInput` component, using the `handleKeyDown` function that checks for keyCode 13 (Enter key), trims the input text, and dispatches the `addTodo` action when the trimmed text is not empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter
  
  The `TodoList` component properly filters todos based on the current filter state ('all', 'active', or 'completed') and maps the filtered todos to `TodoItem` components.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos
  
  The application includes a "toggle-all" input in the `TodoList` component with an `onChange` handler that dispatches the `toggleAll` action to set the completion status of all todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted
  
  The `TodoItem` component provides handlers for toggling (`handleToggle`), editing (via `onEdit`), and deleting (`handleDestroy`) individual todo items.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode
  
  The `TodoItem` component includes a label with an `onDoubleClick` handler that calls the `onEdit` function, which sets the editing state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo
  
  In the `TodoItem` component, the `handleKeyDown` function checks for keyCode 13 (Enter key) and calls `handleSubmit` to save the edited todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value
  
  The `handleKeyDown` function in `TodoItem` checks for keyCode 27 (Escape key) and resets the edit text to the original todo title and calls `onCancel` to exit editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The `TodoFooter` component displays the count of active items with the correct pluralization of "item" or "items".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The `TodoFooter` component includes links for filtering todos by 'all', 'active', or 'completed' status, with appropriate CSS classes to highlight the selected filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos
  
  The `TodoFooter` component includes a "Clear completed" button with an `onClick` handler that dispatches the `clearCompleted` action, and conditionally renders it only when there are completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence
  
  The application uses the `localStorage` utility functions to save and load todos, and the Redux slice actions call `saveToLocalStorage` after modifying the todos state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state
  
  The application conditionally renders components and elements based on the state of todos, such as hiding the footer when there are no todos and hiding the "Clear completed" button when there are no completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count
  
  The `TodoFooter` component correctly pluralizes 'item' based on the count of active todos: `const activeTodoWord = count === 1 ? 'item' : 'items';`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components
  
  The application has been decomposed into smaller, focused components (TodoApp, TodoList, TodoItem, TodoInput, TodoFooter) with clear responsibilities and interfaces.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality
  
  The code is organized in a feature-based structure, with components, store, and types related to todos grouped together under the `features/todos` directory.
