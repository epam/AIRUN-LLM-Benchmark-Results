# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all React imports use React 18.x compatible syntax  
  The main entry point (index.tsx) imports { createRoot } from "react-dom/client", which is the React 18.x API.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all components use functional component syntax with hooks instead of class components  
  All components are implemented as functional components and make proper use of hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect, useCallback).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Redux Toolkit's createSlice is used for state management  
  The todosSlice.ts file employs createSlice from Redux Toolkit to define actions and reducers.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for all props, state, and Redux store  
  Appropriate interfaces are defined in features/todos/store/types.ts and throughout the application (for example, TodoItemProps and TodoFooterProps).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses immutable state updates in reducers  
  Although the implementation appears to modify the state (e.g., using push), Redux Toolkit integrates immer behind the scenes to enforce immutability.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that nanoid is used for ID generation instead of custom UUID implementation  
  ID generation is handled by the imported nanoid function.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application uses React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate  
  Components such as TodoList, TodoItem, and TodoFooter are wrapped with React.memo for memoization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that useCallback is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders  
  Event handlers are consistently memoized using useCallback in various components (e.g., in TodoInput, TodoList, and TodoItem).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage handling is implemented in a modern way  
  Utility functions for localStorage (loadFromLocalStorage and saveToLocalStorage) are implemented with error handling using try/catch.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows consistent naming conventions throughout the application  
  The naming conventions (camelCase for variables and PascalCase for components) are maintained consistently across the codebase.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper error handling is implemented where necessary  
  The localStorage utility functions include try/catch blocks to handle errors. Other parts of the code rely on Redux Toolkitâ€™s internal error management, which is acceptable.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware  
  The Redux store is created using configureStore from Redux Toolkit, which automatically adds standard middleware (like thunk and the immutable state invariant middleware).

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that React.lazy is used for code splitting where appropriate  
  The provided code does not utilize React.lazy for code splitting. In a modern React application, code splitting with React.lazy can be used to optimize load times, but it is absent here.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the codebase has no TODOs remaining  
  There are no TODO comments remaining in the codebase, indicating a clean and complete implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux Provider wraps the application entry point  
  In the index.tsx file, the application is wrapped by the Redux Provider, ensuring the Redux store is correctly available throughout the app.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure strict TypeScript type checking is implemented throughout the application  
  The codebase uses TypeScript extensively, with proper type annotations for components, state, props, and events, which demonstrates strict type checking.
