# Evaluation Report

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The TodoInput component listens for the Enter key (keyCode 13) and dispatches the addTodo action if the trimmed text is non-empty.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The TodoList component filters the todos based on the current filter value ("all", "active", or "completed") before displaying them.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  The TodoList component includes a checkbox (with id="toggle-all") whose onChange event dispatches the toggleAll action to change the completion status for all todos.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  In the TodoItem component, toggling is achieved using a checkbox, deletion via a button with the class "destroy", and editing via double-click events along with input submission.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  The TodoItem component uses an onDoubleClick handler (attached to the label) that triggers editing mode by calling the provided onEdit prop.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  In the TodoItem component, the onKeyDown handler listens for the Enter key (keyCode 13) and calls the handleSubmit function to save the edited todo.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  The TodoItem componentâ€™s onKeyDown event handler listens for the Escape key (keyCode 27) and resets the edit text back to the original todo title, calling onCancel.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooter component receives the count of active todos (calculated in TodoApp) and displays it within a designated element.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The TodoFooter component renders anchor links for "All", "Active", and "Completed", applying a selected style based on the current filter.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  In TodoFooter, a button with the class "clear-completed" is conditionally rendered if there are any completed todos, and its onClick handler dispatches the clearCompleted action.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  The Redux slice leverages localStorage by calling loadFromLocalStorage when initializing state and saveToLocalStorage in every reducer to persist changes.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  TodoApp conditionally renders the TodoList if there are todos and the TodoFooter if there is any active or completed count, ensuring UI elements are shown/hidden appropriately.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  The TodoFooter component determines whether to use "item" or "items" based on the count value, ensuring correct pluralization.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The code is refactored into multiple components (TodoInput, TodoList, TodoItem, TodoFooter) and organized into feature-specific folders, promoting maintainability and separation of concerns.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The provided project structure clearly separates files into features (e.g., todos), app-level components, and utilities, following a feature-based architecture.
