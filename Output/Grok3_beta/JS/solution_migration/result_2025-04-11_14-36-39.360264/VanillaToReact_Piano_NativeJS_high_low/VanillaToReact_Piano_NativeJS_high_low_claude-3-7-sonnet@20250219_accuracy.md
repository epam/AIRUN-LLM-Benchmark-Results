# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration
  
  The solution properly shows usage of React 18 features (like ReactDOM.createRoot in index.tsx) and demonstrates setup with Create React App TypeScript template.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure
  
  The solution properly defines TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/index.ts` including `SoundMapper` and `PianoKeyData` which are correctly used throughout the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks
  
  All components (Header, Footer, Piano, PianoKey) are implemented as functional components using React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)
  
  The solution correctly uses useState for managing activeNotes and showLetters state, and useEffect for keyboard event listeners with proper cleanup.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels
  
  Keyboard event handlers are implemented in the Piano component with appropriate effects and cleanup.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events
  
  The PianoKey component correctly implements all required mouse interactions using React synthetic events.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment
  
  Audio resources are properly handled using a custom hook (useAudio) with useMemo to prevent unnecessary re-creation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility
  
  Fullscreen functionality is implemented using useCallback with proper error handling for browser compatibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns
  
  Conditional class application is properly implemented using template literals and state-driven conditions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate
  
  Performance optimizations are implemented, including React.memo for the PianoKey component and useCallback for event handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations
  
  Audio playback is correctly implemented with considerations for React lifecycle, including setting currentTime to 0 before playing and error handling with .catch().

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application
  
  The code consistently uses TypeScript typing throughout, with proper interfaces, type annotations, and React.FC typing for components.
