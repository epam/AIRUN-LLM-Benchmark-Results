# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'
  
  The Header component in `src/components/Header.tsx` correctly renders a header with the title "Virtual Piano" inside an h1 element with the className "header-title".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons
  
  In the Piano component (`src/components/Piano.tsx`), there is a div with className "btn-container" that contains two buttons - one with text "Notes" and the other with text "Letters", both having appropriate classNames and onClick handlers for toggling between views.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)
  
  The Piano component properly renders all piano keys - 7 white/natural keys and 5 black/sharp keys with an empty spacer slot, as defined in the `whiteKeys` and `blackKeys` arrays.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes
  
  Each PianoKey component properly receives data attributes through the props.data object and applies them in the render method:
  ```jsx
  <div
    className={`piano-key ${data.isSharp ? 'sharp' : ''} ${isActive ? 'piano-key-active' : ''}`}
    data-letter={data.letter}
    data-note={data.note}
    onMouseDown={handleMouseDown}
    onMouseUp={handleMouseUp}
    onMouseOut={handleMouseOut}
    onMouseMove={handleMouseMove}
  />
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked
  
  The application loads audio files using the `useAudio` hook and plays the correct audio when a key is clicked through the `playNote` function in the Piano component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)
  
  The Piano component tracks active notes in the `activeNotes` state array and passes this information to each PianoKey component. When a key is active, the "piano-key-active" class is applied to highlight it.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes
  
  The Piano component includes keyboard event handlers (`handleKeyDown` and `handleKeyUp`) that are properly attached to the window via useEffect, and they play/stop notes based on key presses.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked
  
  The Piano component includes a `showLetters` state variable and a `toggleView` function that updates this state. The "letters" class is conditionally applied to the piano component based on this state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes
  
  The Piano component includes a `toggleFullscreen` function that correctly uses the Fullscreen API to enter and exit fullscreen mode when the button is clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly
  
  The Piano component's `activeNotes` state array can track multiple active notes simultaneously, and the keyboard event handlers are properly implemented to handle multiple key presses.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys
  
  Each PianoKey component includes a `handleMouseMove` event handler that checks if the left mouse button is pressed (`e.buttons === 1`) and triggers the `onPlay` function, enabling drag-to-play functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information
  
  The Footer component in `src/components/Footer.tsx` correctly renders a footer with the year "2020" inside a div with the className "footer-container".
