# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration  
  The answer clearly shows the creation of a new React app using Create React App with the TypeScript template. Additionally, in the index file, ReactDOM.createRoot is used, which is specific to React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure  
  The solution defines a TypeScript interface (SoundMapper) in the types folder for mapping audio elements, thereby fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks  
  All components (Header, Piano, Footer, PianoKey, Piano) are implemented as functional components using React.FC and leverage React hooks such as useState, useMemo, useEffect, and useCallback.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)  
  The application effectively manages state using useState (for active notes and UI toggle) and uses useEffect to add and clean up event listeners, showing correct state management practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels  
  Keyboard events are appropriately handled in the Piano component by listening to keydown and keyup events on the window, making sure they are added and removed with useEffect.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events  
  The PianoKey component utilizes React synthetic events (onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseOut, onMouseMove) to manage mouse interactions correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment  
  Audio playback is managed via a custom hook (useAudio) that uses useMemo, ensuring that audio elements are only initialized once, which is an appropriate approach in React.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility  
  The fullscreen toggle function employs proper browser API calls (requestFullscreen, exitFullscreen) along with error handling, implemented within a React callback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns  
  The code uses template literals and conditional logic to apply CSS classes based on state (for active notes and toggled views), adhering to React best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate  
  The PianoKey component is wrapped with React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders, and useCallback is used for event handlers, confirming the implementation of performance optimizations.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations  
  Audio playback is appropriately initiated (with sound.currentTime reset before play) and stopped using Reactâ€™s lifecycle (state management and effect cleanup), ensuring that the lifecycle is properly handled.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application  
  TypeScript is consistently applied across the application with clearly defined interfaces and typed props, ensuring strict type safety.
