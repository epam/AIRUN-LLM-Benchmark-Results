# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'  
  The Header component renders an h1 element with the text "Virtual Piano".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons  
  The Piano component contains a div with the class "btn-container" that holds two buttons labeled "Notes" and "Letters".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)  
  The Piano component maps over two arrays (whiteKeys and blackKeys) to render all natural and sharp keys (with a spacer rendered for alignment).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes  
  Each PianoKey component renders a div with data-letter and data-note attributes reflecting the provided key data.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked  
  The useAudio hook provides the correct audio element for each note, and the onMouseDown event of the PianoKey triggers playback with proper audio configurations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)  
  Active notes are tracked in the state and passed to each PianoKey, which conditionally applies the "piano-key-active" class to indicate the active state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes  
  Global keydown and keyup event listeners are correctly set up in the Piano component to identify key presses based on letter matching and trigger audio playback.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked  
  The toggleView function correctly switches the state, and the conditional CSS class ("letters") applied to the piano container controls the display mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes  
  The toggleFullscreen function utilizes the Fullscreen API to correctly request or exit fullscreen mode using document.documentElement and document.exitFullscreen.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly  
  Active notes are managed as an array, allowing multiple notes to be active concurrently. However, while the code structure supports polyphonic playback, there is a slight uncertainty without explicit testing scenarios confirming simultaneous audio playback behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys  
  The PianoKey component listens for onMouseMove events and triggers playback if the left mouse button is pressed, enabling drag functionality for continuous note playing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information  
  The Footer component renders a container with the text "2020", meeting the requirement for displaying year information.
