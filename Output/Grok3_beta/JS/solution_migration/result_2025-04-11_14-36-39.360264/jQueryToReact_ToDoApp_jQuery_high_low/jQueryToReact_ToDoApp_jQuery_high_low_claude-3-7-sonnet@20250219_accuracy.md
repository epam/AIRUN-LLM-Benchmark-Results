# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18.x
  
  The implementation clearly uses React 18 as evidenced by the use of `ReactDOM.createRoot` in the `index.tsx` file, which is a React 18 specific API.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript for type safety
  
  TypeScript is used throughout the application with proper type annotations, interfaces, and type definitions. All components are defined with TypeScript syntax (React.FC), and proper types are defined in the types/index.ts file.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for state management
  
  The code utilizes Redux Toolkit with `createSlice` in the `todoSlice.ts` file, properly defining actions and reducers in a modern Redux approach.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm nanoid is used for generating unique IDs
  
  The implementation imports and uses nanoid in the todoSlice.ts file for generating unique IDs for new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code uses functional components with hooks instead of class components
  
  All components are implemented as functional components using React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, useSelector, useDispatch) instead of class components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains the same routing functionality with proper route handling
  
  The implementation uses react-router-dom for routing and properly handles different filter views (/all, /active, /completed) in the TodoFooter component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Redux store is properly configured with appropriate slices
  
  The Redux store is correctly set up in store/index.ts with the todoSlice reducer properly integrated.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the Redux provider is set up in the application entry point
  
  The Redux Provider is properly wrapped around the application in App.tsx to make the store available throughout the component tree.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for all data structures
  
  TypeScript interfaces and types are well-defined, including Todo, FilterType, TodoState, RootState, and AppDispatch types.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows React best practices for component composition
  
  The code follows React best practices by breaking down the UI into meaningful, reusable components with clear separation of concerns.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles keyboard events properly
  
  Keyboard events are properly handled, including Enter key for creating/updating todos and Escape key for canceling edits, as implemented in the TodoItem and TodoHeader components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application maintains local storage persistence
  
  Local storage persistence is implemented in the todoSlice reducers, saving todo data after each state change and loading it during initialization.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  There are no obvious sources of console errors or warnings in the code. The implementation follows React patterns that should avoid common warnings.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application implements proper error handling
  
  The code includes proper checks before performing operations, such as checking for todo existence before updates and validating input before adding or updating todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code is optimized with no unnecessary re-renders
  
  The code demonstrates good optimization practices by using selective state access with useSelector and proper component structure to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
