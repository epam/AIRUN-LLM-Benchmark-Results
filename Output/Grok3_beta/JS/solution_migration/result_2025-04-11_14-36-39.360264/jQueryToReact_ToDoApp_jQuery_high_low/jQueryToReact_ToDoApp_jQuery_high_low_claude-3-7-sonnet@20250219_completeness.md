- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos
  
  The application includes a header component (`TodoHeader.tsx`) with the title "todos" and an input field with the class "new-todo" for creating new todos. The input field has proper placeholder text "What needs to be done?" and responds to keyboard events for adding new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos
  
  The application includes a main section with a toggle-all checkbox in the `TodoHeader.tsx` component and a list of todos in the `TodoList.tsx` component. The toggle-all checkbox is properly implemented to mark all todos as complete or incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button
  
  Each todo item in the `TodoItem.tsx` component includes a toggle checkbox with the class "toggle", a label to display the title, and a delete button with the class "destroy".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode
  
  The `TodoItem.tsx` component includes functionality to enable editing mode when a todo label is double-clicked. This is implemented with the `handleEdit` function which sets the editing state to true when the label's `onDoubleClick` event is triggered.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The application implements filtering functionality in both the `TodoFooter.tsx` and `TodoList.tsx` components. The footer contains the filter links, and the list filters todos based on the selected filter state from Redux.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization
  
  The `TodoFooter.tsx` component displays the count of active todos with proper pluralization: "item" for a single item, "items" for multiple items.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter
  
  The `TodoFooter.tsx` component includes filter links for "All", "Active", and "Completed" that are highlighted based on the current filter state using the "selected" class.

  The `TodoFooter.tsx` component conditionally renders a "Clear completed" button when there are completed todos, using the condition `{completedCount > 0 && (...)}`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter
  
  The `TodoHeader.tsx` component allows creating new todos by typing in the input field and pressing Enter. This is handled by the `handleKeyPress` function that checks for the Enter key (keyCode 13) and dispatches the `addTodo` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos
  
  The `TodoItem.tsx` component allows toggling the completion status of individual todos through the checkbox, which dispatches the `toggleTodo` action when changed.

  The `TodoHeader.tsx` component includes a toggle-all checkbox that allows toggling all todos at once by dispatching the `toggleAll` action when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management
  
  The `TodoItem.tsx` component allows editing todos with proper focus management. It uses a ref to focus on the edit input field when entering edit mode and handles keyboard events for submitting (Enter) or canceling (Escape) edits.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos
  
  The `TodoItem.tsx` component allows deleting individual todos by clicking the destroy button, which dispatches the `deleteTodo` action.
