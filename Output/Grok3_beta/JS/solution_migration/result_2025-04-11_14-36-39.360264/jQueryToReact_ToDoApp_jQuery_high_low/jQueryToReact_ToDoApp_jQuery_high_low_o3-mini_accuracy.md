# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18.x  
  The use of ReactDOM.createRoot in index.tsx confirms that the application is built with React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript for type safety  
  The file extensions (.tsx, .ts) and explicit type definitions (interfaces and type aliases) indicate full TypeScript usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for state management  
  The implementation in src/store/todoSlice.ts shows usage of Redux Toolkit’s createSlice.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm nanoid is used for generating unique IDs  
  The addTodo reducer clearly makes use of the nanoid function to create unique IDs.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code uses functional components with hooks instead of class components  
  Every component is implemented as a functional component utilizing hooks like useState and useEffect.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains the same routing functionality with proper route handling  
  The integration of BrowserRouter, useNavigate, and useLocation in App.tsx and TodoFooter.tsx demonstrates proper routing and route handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Redux store is properly configured with appropriate slices  
  The store is correctly configured in src/store/index.ts, and the todoSlice is properly imported and integrated.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the Redux Provider is set up in the application entry point  
  The App.tsx file wraps the application in the Redux Provider, passing the configured store.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for all data structures  
  The src/types/index.ts file defines clear interfaces such as Todo and FilterType, ensuring type safety.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows React best practices for component composition  
  The code is split into modular, reusable components that follow React’s best practices, such as separation of concerns and clear component responsibilities.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles keyboard events properly (Enter key for creating/updating todos, Escape key for canceling edits)  
  The TodoHeader and TodoItem components correctly handle key events (using keyCode to detect Enter and Escape) for submitting and canceling actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application maintains local storage persistence if implemented  
  The reducers in todoSlice update localStorage after every mutation to ensure persistence.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  While the code is structured correctly and appears free of obvious issues, without runtime testing there is a slight uncertainty (hence 90%). However, the code adheres to common practices that generally avoid console errors and warnings.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application implements proper error handling  
  Basic error handling is present (for example, checking for the existence of a todo before updating in toggleTodo). Although error handling is minimal, it is appropriate for this context.

- **Pass** (85%): Confirm the code is optimized with no unnecessary re-renders  
  The code is organized into functional components with hooks, which minimizes unnecessary re-renders. There is potential for further memoization (e.g., with React.memo or useMemo) in performance-critical scenarios, which is why confidence is slightly lower. Nonetheless, for the given scope, the optimization is acceptable.
