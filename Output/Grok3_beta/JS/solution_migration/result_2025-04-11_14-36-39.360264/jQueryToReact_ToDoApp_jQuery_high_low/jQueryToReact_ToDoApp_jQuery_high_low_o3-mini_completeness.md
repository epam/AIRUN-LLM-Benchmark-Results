- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos  
  The TodoHeader component renders a main section (when todos exist) with a toggle-all checkbox. Meanwhile, TodoList renders the list of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button  
  The TodoItem component shows a checkbox (with class "toggle") to change completion status, displays the title label, and includes a button with class "destroy" to delete the todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode  
  In TodoItem, the label has an onDoubleClick handler that sets editing mode, allowing the user to modify the todo text.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  Filtering is implemented through TodoFooter and TodoList components using Redux state. Filter links for "All", "Active", and "Completed" are present and update the filter state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization  
  The TodoFooter component calculates and displays the active todo count, switching between "item" and "items" based on the count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter  
  The filter links in TodoFooter use conditional classNames (assigning "selected") to indicate the current filter, confirming visual highlighting.

  The TodoFooter conditionally renders a "Clear completed" button whenever there are completed todos.

  The TodoHeader component includes functionality to toggle all todos using the toggleAll action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management

  Each TodoItem includes a delete button that dispatches the deleteTodo action upon clicking.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos  
  The TodoFooter provides a "Clear completed" button that dispatches the clearCompleted action to remove completed todos.
