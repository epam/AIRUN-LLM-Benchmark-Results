# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist
  
  The code includes explicit tests for basic rendering with default props in the "Rendering" section, specifically the test: `renders without crashing with default props`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present
  
  The test suite includes tests for keyboard navigation, specifically arrow down, enter, and escape keys in the "User Interactions" and "Accessibility" sections.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)
  
  The code includes tests for mouse interactions, particularly in the "User Interactions" section with tests like `handles mouse click to open menu`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior
  
  The test suite tests controlled component behavior in the "State Management" section, particularly in `handles controlled component value changes`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values
  
  The test suite includes tests for selecting values and clearing values in the "State Management" section.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented
  
  Tests for menu opening/closing are included in the "Menu and Options" section with the test `opens and closes menu correctly`.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality
  
  The test suite includes tests for filtering options based on input in the "Menu and Options" section.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist
  
  There are no specific tests for multi-select behavior in the test suite. While the code has interfaces that support multi-select (as seen in the `valueTernary` mock), no tests explicitly verify this functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility
  
  The "Accessibility" section includes tests for ARIA attributes with `has correct ARIA attributes`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested
  
  The "Edge Cases" section explicitly tests for empty options with `handles empty options`.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states
  
  The test suite includes tests for loading state in the "Edge Cases" section.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states
  
  The test suite includes tests for disabled state in the "Edge Cases" section.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance
  
  The "Performance" section includes a test for rendering large option sets.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested
  
  While the test suite simulates focus events, there are no explicit tests that verify focus management behavior such as focus returning to appropriate elements after menu close or during keyboard navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering
  
  The test suite verifies value rendering in tests like `handles controlled component value changes`.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations
  
  There are no tests specifically for custom formatOptionLabel implementations in the test suite.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)
  
  The test suite includes tests for these callback functions in various sections, particularly in "State Management" and "Menu and Options" sections.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)
  
  While there is a test for the clear button functionality, there are no comprehensive tests for all indicator components including dropdown indicators.
