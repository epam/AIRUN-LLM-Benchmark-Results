# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist  
  The test "renders without crashing with default props" confirms that basic rendering is covered.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present  
  Multiple tests check keyboard events such as arrow down, enter, escape, and even keyboard-only navigation.

- **Fail** (85%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)  
  While there is a test for handling a mouse click to open the menu, there is no explicit test for hover interactions. This omission reduces full coverage of mouse interactions.

- **Fail** (80%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior  
  The suite provides tests for controlled behavior via value prop changes. However, there is no explicit test for an uncontrolled scenario, leaving this area uncovered.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values  
  The test suite covers selection and clearing (removal) of values. Although a distinct test for "removing" a value isn’t explicitly present, the clearing functionality sufficiently covers this behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented  
  Tests exist for opening the menu via keyboard (arrow down) and closing it (escape), adequately verifying the menu behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality  
  There is a test ("filters options based on input") that confirms the component filters options based on user input.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist  
  The test suite is configured for a single-select scenario (Props with false multi-select flag) and does not include any test for multi-select behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility  
  Multiple tests check for correct ARIA attributes (e.g., aria-label, aria-expanded, aria-autocomplete, aria-haspopup) ensuring accessibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested  
  A dedicated test validates that the component handles empty options by displaying "No options."

- **Fail** (90%): Validate tests for loading and error states  
  The test for the loading state ("handles loading state") is present; however, there is no test addressing error states, which are part of the evaluation criteria.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states  
  The test for a disabled state is included, confirming that the component becomes disabled when the isDisabled prop is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance  
  A test exists that renders a large set of options (1,000 options) without crashing, addressing performance concerns.

- **Fail** (85%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested  
  Although a test initiates focus via tabbing and interacts with the component, there is no explicit assertion verifying focus management (e.g., checking document.activeElement), leaving this area partially unverified.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering  
  There is a test for controlled value rendering (displaying the selected option’s label), but no specific test for placeholder rendering is included.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations  
  The suite does not include any tests verifying custom formatOptionLabel functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)  
  Callback functions are thoroughly tested in various scenarios (keyboard interactions, mouse events, filtering) ensuring proper callback invocations.

- **Fail** (85%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)  
  While there is a test for the clear button and a loading indicator, there is no explicit test for the dropdown indicator component, resulting in partial coverage.
