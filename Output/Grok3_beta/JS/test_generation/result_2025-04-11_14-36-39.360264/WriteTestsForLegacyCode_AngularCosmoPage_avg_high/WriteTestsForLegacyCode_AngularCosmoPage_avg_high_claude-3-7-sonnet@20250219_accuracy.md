# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)
  
  The tests use Jasmine as the testing framework with Karma as the test runner, which is explicitly mentioned in the answer. The code includes a proper Karma configuration file and uses Jasmine's syntax throughout (`describe`, `it`, `beforeEach`, etc.).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints
  
  The tests properly inject and mock the $resource service. The REST factory test verifies that all REST endpoints are defined correctly and that the update method is configured properly with PUT HTTP method for applicable resources.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation
  
  All test suites use `beforeEach` hooks to set up the testing environment, inject dependencies, and initialize spies. The `pageCtrl.spec.js` also uses `afterEach` to verify no outstanding HTTP expectations or requests remain.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls
  
  All HTTP requests are properly mocked using `$httpBackend`. For example, in the `pageCtrl.spec.js` tests for `deletePage` and `savePage` methods, all API calls are explicitly mocked using `$httpBackend.expectDELETE`, `$httpBackend.expectPOST`, and `$httpBackend.expectPUT`.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection
  
  All tests properly use AngularJS dependency injection. Dependencies are injected in the `beforeEach` blocks using the inject function, and properly prefixed with underscores where needed (e.g., `_$controller_`, `_$rootScope_`, etc.).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations
  
  The tests handle asynchronous operations properly, particularly with HTTP requests. For example, in the `pageCtrl.spec.js`, `$httpBackend.flush()` is called appropriately after setting up expectations to ensure promises are resolved.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies
  
  The tests make excellent use of spies for external dependencies. For instance, spies are created for `$location.path()`, `$rootScope.$broadcast()`, `$translate.then()`, `localStorage.getItem()`, and `localStorage.setItem()`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization
  
  All tests follow the standard Jasmine structure with nested `describe` blocks and `it` statements. The tests are well-organized with logical groupings, making them easy to read and understand.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls
  
  The tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls. For example, in the `savePage` tests, there are separate tests for successful creation, successful updates, and error responses.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate
  
  The tests appropriately simulate user interactions by directly calling controller methods that would be triggered by user actions, such as `titleChange()`, `savePage()`, `deletePage()`, `autocompleteTags()`, and `selectSuggestion()`.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage
  
  The tests properly clean up after execution using `afterEach` hooks to verify no outstanding HTTP expectations or requests remain with `$httpBackend.verifyNoOutstandingExpectation()` and `$httpBackend.verifyNoOutstandingRequest()`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested
  
  The test names are clear and descriptive, clearly stating what functionality is being tested. For example: "should initialize with default values", "should auto-generate URL from title when URL is new", "should handle error when saving new page".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible
  
  The tests focus on validating expected outputs and behavior rather than specific implementation details. For example, tests check that controller methods produce expected results (e.g., correctly formatted URLs, appropriate error
