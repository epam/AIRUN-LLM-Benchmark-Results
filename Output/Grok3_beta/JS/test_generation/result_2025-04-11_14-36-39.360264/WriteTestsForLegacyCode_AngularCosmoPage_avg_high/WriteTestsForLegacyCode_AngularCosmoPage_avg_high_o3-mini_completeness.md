# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources  
  All resource endpoints and update method configurations for the REST factory are tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly  
  The Page factory tests check every expected property (id, title, description, header, subheader, body, url, type, published, published_date, themePages, timestamp, extras, misc).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly  
  The Users factory test verifies initialization for all defined properties (id, username, name, bio, email, facebook, twitter, photo, role).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods  
  The pageCtrl test suite contains tests for initialization, localVersion, deleteNewerVersion, deletePage, titleChange, savePage, autocompleteTags, and selectSuggestion.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller  
  The initialization tests confirm that the page object is set up using default values from the Page factory, including scheduleDate.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation  
  The tests for titleChange check that a new title auto-generates the appropriate URL and preserves a custom URL when already set.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction  
  There is no explicit test for a function named saveLocal. Although localStorage interactions are tested via localVersion and deleteNewerVersion, a dedicated saveLocal test is missing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality  
  The autocompleteTags tests verify that tag suggestions are fetched and handled correctly for both provided and empty tag arrays.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)  
  While tests cover saving a new page, updating an existing one, and error handling for savePage, there is no explicit test for a "duplicate" branch as required by the evaluation criteria.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types  
  The savePage tests include checks for scenarios with an empty URL and missing page type, ensuring appropriate error notifications.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly  
  The deletePage tests confirm that all deletion endpoints are called and that the application correctly redirects and notifies after deletion.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions  
  The localVersion and deleteNewerVersion tests effectively verify interactions with localStorage and the correct broadcast of events regarding page versions.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components  
  The test coverage is asserted to target over 80% for critical paths. Although exact metrics arenâ€™t provided, the comprehensive unit tests hint at robust coverage. (Slightly less than 100% confidence due to lack of explicit reported metrics.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling  
  Multiple tests spy on and assert $rootScope.$broadcast calls, confirming that events are correctly emitted in response to actions.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality  
  There is a basic check ensuring that scheduleDate is defined; however, more detailed tests for various scheduling scenarios would make this coverage more robust. (Confidence is slightly reduced given the minimal testing of date-related logic.)
