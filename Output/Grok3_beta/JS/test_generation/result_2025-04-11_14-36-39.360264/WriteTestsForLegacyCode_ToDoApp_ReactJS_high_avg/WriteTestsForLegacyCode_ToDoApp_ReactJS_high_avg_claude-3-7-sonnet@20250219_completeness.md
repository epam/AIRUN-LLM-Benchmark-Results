# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering
- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events
- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts
- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation
- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos
- **Pass** (80%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions

    The code includes tests for subscribe functionality by setting up a mockCallback in the beforeEach section and verifying it's called after various operations. However, there is no explicit test for the inform function itself. The tests verify the callback is called (which implicitly tests inform), but there's no direct test that specifically focuses on testing the inform method in isolation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data
- **Pass** (90%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented

    While there is a mock setup for Router in the setupTests.ts file, and the app.test.tsx does include tests for filtering todos which would involve routing, there could be more explicit tests for the Router initialization and navigation between routes. The current implementation tests the effects of routing (filtered views) rather than the routing mechanism itself.
