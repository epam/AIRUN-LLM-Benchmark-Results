# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering  
  The test file includes a test case “should render TodoApp with todos” which confirms that the components render correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos  
  The test “should add new todo on enter key” verifies that adding a new todo is handled properly by the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos  
  The test “should toggle all todos on checkbox click” is present and confirms this functionality is covered.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos  
  The test “should filter todos based on nowShowing state” validates that filtering functionality is implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The test “should clear completed todos” explicitly checks that completed todos can be cleared.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering  
  The test “should render todo item correctly” (and its related tests) confirms that the component is rendered as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos  
  Multiple tests (e.g., toggling via checkbox, destroy on empty submit, and edit mode activation) are included to cover these functionalities.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events  
  Tests for key events (ESC and ENTER key presses) ensure that keyboard interactions are handled.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts  
  The test “should render footer with correct counts” confirms that the component responds correctly to different state values.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation  
  Tests verifying filter highlighting (for All, Active, and Completed) demonstrate that navigation among filters is covered.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The test “should call onClearCompleted when clear button is clicked” verifies that the clear-completed functionality is implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos  
  The test suite for TodoModel covers adding todos, toggling them, saving changes, and destroying todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions  
  The tests subscribe a callback (mockCallback) and verify that it is triggered after actions like add, toggle, etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  A dedicated test (“should clear completed todos”) confirms that completed todos are removed as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation  
  The test for `Utils.uuid()` validates that the generated UUID conforms to the expected format.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality  
  Tests for `Utils.pluralize` ensure that pluralization behaves correctly for different counts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations  
  Tests confirm that the `Utils.store` function both saves to and retrieves data from localStorage correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function  
  The test for the `Utils.extend` method confirms that it correctly merges two objects.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx  
  Most React component test files are named with the .test.tsx extension (e.g., app.test.tsx, footer.test.tsx, todoItem.test.tsx). For non-React code, .test.ts is appropriately used.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data  
  Sample todo data is provided in several tests (e.g., in todoItem.tsx and TodoModel tests), ensuring consistent, reusable fixtures.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented  
  While a Router mock is defined in setupTests.ts, there are no explicit tests verifying routing behavior within any test file. This could be a missing aspect.  
  Explanation: Although the Router is mocked, the test suite does not include explicit test cases that simulate or assert routing functionality. This evaluation is given with 90% confidence because routing might be indirectly covered in the application context, but based on the provided tests, explicit routing tests are absent.
