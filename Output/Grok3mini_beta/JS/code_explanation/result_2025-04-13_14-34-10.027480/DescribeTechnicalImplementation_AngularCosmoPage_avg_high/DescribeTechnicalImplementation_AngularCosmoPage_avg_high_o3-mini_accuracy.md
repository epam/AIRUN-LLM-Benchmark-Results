# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies Angular.js as the framework used  
  The documentation clearly states that this is an Angular.js (Angular 1.x) codebase (e.g., use of angular.module, controllers, dependency injection, etc.).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all factories (REST, Page, Users) are accurately documented with their purposes  
  The documentation provides a detailed explanation for the REST factory (for API calls), the Page factory (for global page data), and the Users factory (for user-specific data), reflecting their respective roles in the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of the Page controller and its functionality is technically accurate  
  The explanation covers the controller’s responsibilities such as page CRUD operations, auto-URL generation, tag autocompletion, unsaved changes handling, and broadcast events. Every functionality is described with technical details.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the RESTful API endpoints are correctly documented  
  The documentation mentions key endpoints and API calls (e.g., REST.content.save(), REST.content.update(), and endpoints such as api/content, api/content/tags) while explaining how they are used for different operations.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that the explanation of Angular module dependencies ($resource, $location, etc.) is correct  
  The documentation accurately lists dependencies like $scope, $location, $translate, and others. Although $resource is not explicitly named, it is implicitly covered as part of the REST factory's functionality.  
  Explanation: The implicit nature of $resource use (often seen in RESTful factories) slightly lowers my confidence even though overall the dependencies are well described.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the page management features (creating, editing, deleting) are accurately described  
  The documentation thoroughly explains each operation (creation, editing, duplication, deletion) and the associated validations and API interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately explains how the local storage mechanism works  
  It explains the use of localStorage for saving unsaved changes, key generation based on URLs, and processes for restoring/discarding unsaved data.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of form validation logic is technically accurate  
  The document mentions client-side validations (e.g., checking for empty URL or missing page type) as part of the save process and confirms that validations are integrated within the saving function.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of publish/schedule date handling is correct  
  The usage of radio buttons, Date.parse, and timestamp conversions is clearly detailed to support immediate publish, draft saving, or scheduled publishing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the tag management and autocomplete feature explanation is technically accurate  
  The documentation outlines the tag autocompletion mechanism using ng-change, REST API queries for tag suggestions, and updating tag selections, all of which are clearly and correctly explained.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the relationship between controllers, factories, and templates is accurately explained  
  The document describes how the pageCtrl controller interacts with the Page factory and REST factory, and how these components link with the page.html template through Angular’s dependency injection and scope binding.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation correctly identifies and explains the purpose of broadcast events  
  The report correctly explains the use of Angular’s $rootScope.$broadcast for notifying changes (e.g., 'notify' or 'contentGet'), and how these events help synchronize state across the application.
