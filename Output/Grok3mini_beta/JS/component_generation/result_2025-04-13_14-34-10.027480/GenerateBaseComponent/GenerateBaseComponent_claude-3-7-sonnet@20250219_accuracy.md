# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x
  
  The component clearly uses React 18.x features, particularly the `useId` hook which was introduced in React 18. The import statement `import { useId } from 'react';` and the usage of this hook in the component confirms this.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
  
  The code includes proper TypeScript interfaces (`Option`, `SearchableSelectProps`), type annotations for props, and correct typing for refs, state variables, and event handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling
  
  The component imports a CSS file (`import './index.css';`) and a complete CSS implementation is provided in the answer.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments
  
  The code is clean, well-structured, and free of TODO comments or placeholder implementations. All functionality is fully implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility
  
  The component uses appropriate React hooks for state management:
  - `useState` for tracking dropdown state, input value, and focused index
  - `useEffect` for managing side effects related to dropdown behavior
  - `useMemo` for optimizing filtered options

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props
  
  The component accepts props for:
  - `options`: Array of selectable options
  - `value`: Currently selected value
  - `onChange`: Callback for selection changes
  - `placeholder`: Optional text placeholder
  
  These props make the component highly reusable across different contexts.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection
  
  The component implements keyboard navigation through the `handleKeyDown` function, supporting:
  - Arrow keys for navigating options
  - Enter for selection/toggling dropdown
  - Escape for closing dropdown

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions
  
  The component properly uses `useRef` for DOM element references and follows best practices by using refs for focus management and container references for detecting outside clicks.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques
  
  The component properly manages focus:
  - Returns focus to the input when dropdown closes
  - Tracks focused index for keyboard navigation
  - Uses appropriate focus states

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
  
  The component uses correct ARIA attributes including:
  - `role="combobox"` for the input
  - `aria-autocomplete="list"`
  - `aria-expanded`
  - `aria-controls`
  - `aria-activedescendant`
  - `role="listbox"` for the dropdown
  - `role="option"` for list items
  - `aria-selected` for selected status

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  The code doesn't contain any patterns that would trigger console errors or warnings during normal operation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component
  
  The component uses `useMemo` to optimize filtered options and carefully manages dependencies in `useEffect` hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
