# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component conditionally renders a <code>ul</code> element with the role "listbox" when <code>isOpen</code> is true, which satisfies the requirement for rendering a dropdown UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  An <code>input</code> element is always rendered (with <code>role="combobox"</code>) and becomes interactive (non-read-only) when the dropdown is open, allowing the user to search among options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The component manages a single selected value using the provided <code>onChange</code> prop. Both keyboard and mouse interactions trigger the selection of a single option.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  Event handling for <code>ArrowDown</code> and <code>ArrowUp</code> is implemented to change the focused index within the filtered options, ensuring proper keyboard navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  The <code>handleKeyDown</code> function processes the Enter key: when the dropdown is open, it selects the currently focused item; when it’s closed, it opens the dropdown, confirming Enter key functionality for selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  The logic in <code>handleKeyDown</code> toggles the dropdown's open/close state using the Enter key when the component is focused, fulfilling the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  A <code>useEffect</code> hook checks for closure of the dropdown (<code>isOpen</code> becomes false) and then sets focus back to the input element, ensuring focus recovery.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  The <code>handleOptionClick</code> function calls <code>setIsOpen(false)</code> after a mouse-driven selection, ensuring the dropdown closes as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  Similar to mouse selection, pressing Enter on a focused option triggers the selection and subsequent closure of the dropdown, verifying keyboard-driven item selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  The component listens for the <code>Escape</code> key in the <code>handleKeyDown</code> function and closes the dropdown by setting <code>isOpen</code> to false.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  An event listener is attached to document clicks; if the click occurs outside the component’s container, the dropdown is closed, meeting the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  When the dropdown is closed, pressing the Enter key opens it (<code>setIsOpen(true)</code> is called), thus fulfilling this requirement.
