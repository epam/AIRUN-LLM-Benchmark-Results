# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
- **Pass** (95%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  While the application properly handles loading and error states, it doesn't explicitly handle the case where the API returns an empty array of results. However, this would technically work correctly (displaying an empty list), but a dedicated empty state message might improve the user experience. Since the SWAPI endpoint will always return data unless there's an error, this is a minor concern.
