# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The provided code fetches character data from "https://swapi.dev/api/people" and renders a list of characters using the JSX map function.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The component returns a <code>&lt;div&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;</code> while the data is being fetched, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  Once the API call is successful, the component maps over the fetched data (the results array) and displays each character’s name.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  There is no implementation of any search bar or input controls; the focus is solely on fetching and displaying data.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each list item is rendered with the character’s name, and the <code>character.url</code> is used as a unique key to identify the element.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The instructions detail using <code>create-react-app</code> with the TypeScript template, indicating the proper application structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The solution utilizes React’s <code>useState</code> hook to manage the <code>loading</code>, <code>error</code>, and <code>data</code> states effectively, ensuring clear state transitions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  The code assigns <code>character.url</code> as a unique key for each list item, which is appropriate given that URLs are unique identifiers.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  The component first checks for the loading and error states. If the fetch returns an empty array, the application simply renders an empty unordered list without an explicit "no data" message. Although this behavior is acceptable under the provided requirements, an explicit empty state message could improve user feedback.  
  (Confidence is 90% because while the empty state does not break the application, it might be enhanced for better UX.)
