# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name
  
  The code clearly implements a search input field with the appropriate onChange handler to update the searchQuery state, which is then used to filter characters by name through API requests.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests
  
  The code includes a loading state that is set to true before fetching data and false after completion, with a conditional rendering of "Loading..." while loading is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query
  
  The implementation uses a useRef with isInitialMount to ensure that an initial API call happens immediately on component mount with an empty search query.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type
  
  The code implements debouncing through setTimeout with a 500ms delay, ensuring that search results update dynamically after the user stops typing, without overwhelming the API with requests.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found
  
  The code includes a conditional rendering for when characters.length is 0, loading is false, and there's no error, displaying "No results found" message.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design
  
  The component uses responsive styling with maxWidth, margin, padding, and the input field is set to width: '100%' with box-sizing: 'border-box' to ensure proper responsiveness.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response
  
  The code maps over the characters array to render each character in a list item when loading is false, there's no error, and characters exist.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed
  
  The code includes basic error handling with try/catch in the fetchCharacters function and displays error messages when they occur. However, it doesn't implement React's ErrorBoundary component for handling rendering errors, which might be considered a more comprehensive approach in some cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props
  
  The code properly defines TypeScript interfaces for Character and SwapiResponse, and uses appropriate type annotations throughout the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities
  
  The implementation preserves the original functionality of displaying a list of Star Wars characters while successfully adding search capabilities with proper API integration.
