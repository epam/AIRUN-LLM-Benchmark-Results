# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type  
  The code includes an <code>input</code> element with an <code>onChange</code> handler that updates the <code>searchQuery</code> state using <code>setSearchQuery</code>.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls  
  The <code>useEffect</code> hook sets a timeout of 500ms before calling <code>fetchCharacters</code> when the <code>searchQuery</code> changes, implementing the required debouncing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured  
  The code imports and uses <code>axios</code> for making API requests with the correct typing for the response via TypeScript generics.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses  
  The code defines interfaces for <code>Character</code> and <code>SwapiResponse</code> and applies strict typing throughout for state, props, and function responses.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters  
  The API URL is correctly constructed with <code>?search=${encodeURIComponent(query)}</code>, ensuring that the search parameter is properly included and URL-encoded.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate  
  The <code>fetchCharacters</code> function is memoized using <code>useCallback</code> to avoid unnecessary re-creations on every render.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback  
  Error handling is integrated into the fetching logic using a <code>try-catch</code> block; errors are caught and displayed to the user through an error message.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing  
  With the debouncing mechanism, API calls are only triggered after a 500ms delay following the last keystroke (except for the immediate initial mount), which meets this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices  
  The component manages state with <code>useState</code> for <code>searchQuery</code>, <code>characters</code>, <code>loading</code>, and <code>error</code>, following React best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code  
  The provided code is clean, with no unused imports or extraneous commented-out sections, ensuring production-ready code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests  
  The <code>loading</code> state is initially set to <code>true</code>, updated to <code>false</code> in a <code>finally</code> block after the request completes, ensuring proper management of the loading indicator.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns  
  The component is implemented using functional components and hooks (such as <code>useEffect</code>, <code>useState</code>, <code>useCallback</code>), adhering to React 18.x patterns.
