# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The code includes an input field with an onChange handler that updates the search query, which in turn triggers API calls to fetch characters filtered by the name provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  The implementation displays a loading indicator ("Loading...") when the loading state is true, which coincides with active API requests.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  On the initial mount, the code immediately calls fetchCharacters with the (initially empty) searchQuery by checking the isInitialMount ref.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  The component debounces updates to the search query and then makes API calls to update the character list accordingly, ensuring dynamic updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  The code conditionally renders a "No results found" message when the characters array is empty, and neither loading nor an error is present.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The container and input field use inline styles (such as max-width and fluid width) to adapt to different screen sizes. Although this is a basic implementation, it meets responsive design requirements.  
  Explanation: The inline styling is simple but effective; more advanced styling (e.g., CSS frameworks or media queries) could further improve responsiveness.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  The code correctly renders the list of characters (using their URL as a key) once the API response is received and the loading state is false.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  The component catches errors in the fetch function and displays a user-friendly error message.  
  Explanation: While the component does not use a dedicated React Error Boundary component, the integrated error state handling is an appropriate solution for this context.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The code defines TypeScript interfaces for Character and SwapiResponse and uses them appropriately with axios and component state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The original functionality (fetching and displaying characters from SWAPI) remains intact, and the new search functionality has been integrated without breaking any existing behavior.
