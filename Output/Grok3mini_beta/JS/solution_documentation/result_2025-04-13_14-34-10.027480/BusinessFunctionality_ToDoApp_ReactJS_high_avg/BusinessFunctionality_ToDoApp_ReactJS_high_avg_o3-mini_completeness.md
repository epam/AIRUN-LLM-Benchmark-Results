# Evaluation Report

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure the document covers all main functionality including adding, editing, deleting, and toggling todos  
  The document clearly details the process for adding new todos, editing existing ones (with double-click and keyboard actions), deleting via the destroy button, and toggling completion via checkboxes.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify the document includes information about filtering todos by status (all, active, completed)  
  Filtering functionality is well described, specifying how the URL hash (e.g., #/active or #/completed) affects the visible list of todos.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm the document describes the user workflow for creating new todo items  
  The workflow is outlined in detail, explaining the role of the input field, keyboard events (pressing Enter), and immediate task display.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure the document covers the editing functionality triggered by double-clicking  
  The explanation covers the editing mechanism clearly including the initiation by double-clicking, followed by saving with the Enter key or canceling with the Esc key.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify the document includes information about the clear completed functionality  
  The document addresses the clear completed feature, describing how completed todos can be purged via the UI component in the footer.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm the document describes the toggle all functionality

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure the document covers the business objectives addressed by the application  
  The business objectives are extracted and explained, including enabling task management, user efficiency, and serving as an educational example of React best practices.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify the document includes performance and scalability considerations  
  Performance optimizations, such as selective re-rendering and immutable state handling, are discussed, along with scalability limitations like local storage constraints.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm the document describes technical constraints and limitations  
  Several technical constraints such as the use of deprecated practices (e.g., ReactDOM.findDOMNode), local storage limitations, and basic routing assumptions are clearly mentioned.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure the document covers the pluralization of item/items text based on count
