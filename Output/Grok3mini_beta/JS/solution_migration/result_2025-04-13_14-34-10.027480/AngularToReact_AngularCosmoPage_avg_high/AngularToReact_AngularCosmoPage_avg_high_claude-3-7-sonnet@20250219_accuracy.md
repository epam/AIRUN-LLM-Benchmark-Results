# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props
  
  The code thoroughly implements TypeScript throughout the entire codebase. All components have proper interfaces for props, state is typed, and functions include parameter and return type annotations. Examples include the `Page` and `User` interfaces in `types/index.ts`, typed props in components like `TopBarProps`, and typed hooks like `useLocalStorage`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management
  
  The code clearly implements Redux Toolkit with `createSlice` for state management. This is evident in files like `pageSlice.ts`, `userSlice.ts`, and `notificationSlice.ts`. The store is configured using `configureStore` in `store.ts`, and slices use proper Redux Toolkit patterns including reducers and async thunks.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components
  
  All components in the codebase are implemented as functional components using the `React.FC` type. Examples include `PageEditor`, `TopBar`, and other components where React hooks are used for state and lifecycle management instead of class methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately
  
  The code demonstrates appropriate use of React hooks throughout. For example, `useState` for local component state, `useEffect` for side effects and data fetching, `useCallback` for memoized callbacks like `handleTitleChange`, and `useMemo` for computed values like `isPublished`.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource
  
  The code uses Axios for API communication as seen in the `api.ts` service file. An Axios instance is created with proper configuration, and all API endpoints are implemented as methods that return Promises.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components
  
  Form handling uses controlled components throughout the application. In `PageEditor.tsx`, input values are bound to state variables and onChange handlers update the state, making them controlled components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation
  
  React Router v6 is correctly implemented with imports from `react-router-dom`, route definitions in `App.tsx`, and usage of hooks like `useParams` and `useNavigate` in components like `PageEditor`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization
  
  The code uses `react-i18next` for internationalization, with proper setup in `App.tsx` and usage of the `useTranslation` hook in components. Translation keys are referenced with the `t()` function throughout the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization
  
  Code splitting is implemented using `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for components like `TopBar`, `ActionBar`, `FormField`, and `TagInput` in the `PageEditor` component. This allows for on-demand loading of these components.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations
  
  `React.memo` is appropriately used to memoize components like `PageEditor` and `TopBar` to prevent unnecessary re-renders when their props haven't changed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks
  
  Dependency arrays are correctly specified in hook calls like `useEffect`, `useCallback`, and `useMemo`. For example, `useEffect` for fetching page data depends on `[url, dispatch]`, and `handleTitleChange` depends on `[autoURL, dispatch]`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models
  
  Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models in `types/index.ts`. These include `Page`, `User`, and `Notification` with properly typed properties and nested structures.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state
  
  Redux selectors are used to access state from the store, as seen in `PageEditor.tsx` where `useSelector` is used to extract state from the Redux store: `
