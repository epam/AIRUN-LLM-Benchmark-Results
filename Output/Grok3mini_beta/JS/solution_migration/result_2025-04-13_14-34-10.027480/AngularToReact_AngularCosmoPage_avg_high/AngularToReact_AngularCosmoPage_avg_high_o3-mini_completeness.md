# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
  The migrated code supports creating, updating, and deleting pages. However, while the save page function accepts a "duplicate" parameter, there is no explicit handling or separate duplication logic implemented. This means functionality for duplicating a page is not clearly provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
  The code includes a FormField component for selecting page type and sets the page type via Redux state. This satisfies the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
  The handler for title changes automatically generates a URL by lowercasing the title and replacing spaces and punctuation. This meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
  The implementation includes a TagInput component and an autocompleteTags function that retrieves suggestions via the API service. This confirms that tag management with autocomplete is provided.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
  The page state includes a "publish" field (with possible values "Y", "N", or "schedule"). Although a dedicated UI control for selecting publish status is not explicitly visible in the form, the underlying state and validations support publish status. Confidence is 90% because the UI integration for this option is not obvious.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
  The code initializes and maintains a "scheduleDate" property in the page state. While a dedicated form field for modifying this date is not clearly shown, the functionality exists in the state, indicating support for scheduled publishing. Confidence is 95% since the full UI integration is not detailed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
  The code implements functions (checkNewerVersion, restoreLocalVersion, and deleteNewerVersion) which compare local storage values with the current page state and allow restoring the local version. This meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
  The code utilizes a Redux notification slice along with addNotification calls in several handlers to display success and error messages, satisfying the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
  The savePage function explicitly checks that a page type and a proper URL (not empty or "new") are present before proceeding. This fulfills the validation requirement.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
  The apiService file includes a comprehensive list of endpoints for content, files, menus, themes, etc. Although not every endpoint is directly connected to UI actions, the presence and structure of the API calls suggest that the original endpoints are handled. Confidence is 90% due to minor uncertainties in complete integration.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
  While the API service includes endpoints for handling content extras, there is no clear integration of extras management in the page editing UI or business logic. This important aspect is therefore not adequately implemented.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
  The API endpoints for content revisions and revisions extras are present, and the deletePage function calls deletion on revisions. Although there is no dedicated UI for managing or viewing revision history, the necessary backend calls are maintained. Confidence is 90% because this functionality is handled indirectly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
  The project is structured into feature-based folders such as components, services, store, and types, and business logic is appropriately separated from UI components.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
  The migrated code uses react-i18next for internationalization. Although not every translation key is explicitly demonstrated, the overall translation functionality is preserved. Confidence is 95% due to some minor details that might need further refinement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
  The routing in App.tsx mimics the original structure by supporting "/new" for creating new pages and "/:url" for editing. This maintains the expected URL structure.
