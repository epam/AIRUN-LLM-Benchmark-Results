# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The component uses FormBuilder, FormGroup, and formControlName, which confirms it leverages Angular’s Reactive Forms.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The synchronous validators (nameValidator, emailValidator, passwordValidator) enforce the specified constraints.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  The component defines async validators (nameAsyncValidator and emailAsyncValidator) that call the ApiService to check for name/email availability.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The FormFieldComponent applies CSS classes based on control validity and whether the field has been touched, displaying error messages accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  In the onSubmit() method, the form dispatches the signup action with the form values, triggering the API call via effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The template in FormFieldComponent includes a span that renders the validation error message when the control is invalid and touched.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  The SignupComponent’s ngOnInit method sets the title to 'Signup - PodBaby' with the Title service.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The component dispatches actions to the store, and separate files show the use of effects and reducers, confirming ngrx integration.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button is disabled when the form is invalid or when the isLoading$ observable indicates an ongoing submission.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  The AuthEffects file correctly maps a successful API response to signupSuccess and manages errors by catching them and dispatching signupFailure.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component uses dependency injection, lifecycle hooks, and a clear separation of concerns. However, while the overall structure is solid, minor improvements (such as ensuring all necessary RxJS operators are imported, e.g., 'map' in ApiService) could be considered.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The ApiService utilizes Angular’s HttpClient and returns Observables for API calls, which is in line with Angular practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The validators display error messages matching the requirements (e.g., character limits for name, regex for email, and minimum length for password), and async validators return appropriate errors when data is already in use.
