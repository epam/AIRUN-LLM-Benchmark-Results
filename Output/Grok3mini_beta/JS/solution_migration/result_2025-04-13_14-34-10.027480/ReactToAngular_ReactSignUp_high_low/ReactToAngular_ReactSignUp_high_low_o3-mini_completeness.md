# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component includes all three required form fields: name, email, and password  
  The SignupComponent initializes a FormGroup with "name", "email", and "password" controls.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page includes a heading 'Join PodBaby today.'  
  The template includes an <h2> element with the text "Join PodBaby today.".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a lead paragraph about membership benefits  
  The template contains a <p class="lead"> element describing membership benefits.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form includes a submit button with appropriate styling and icon  
  The form has a <button type="submit"> styled with classes "btn btn-primary form-control" and includes an <app-icon> component with the icon "sign-in".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a link to the login page with appropriate text  
  The template contains an anchor tag (<a routerLink="/login">) with the text "Already a member? Log in here."

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the FormGroup or equivalent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display  
  The component uses Angular’s Reactive Forms, and the custom FormFieldComponent manages error display based on the control’s state.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the Icon component or equivalent is implemented for the signup button  
  The <app-icon> component is referenced in the signup button. Although its actual implementation is not shown, it is assumed to exist elsewhere in the project, which is why the evaluation is rated with 90% confidence.  
  Explanation: The code relies on <app-icon>, but the component’s implementation isn’t provided in the submission.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all validation rules are implemented (name length, email format, password length)  
  The code provides validators for name (length between 3 and 60), email (regular expression check), and password (minimum length of 6).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure asynchronous validation for both name and email uniqueness is implemented  
  Both nameAsyncValidator and emailAsyncValidator are defined and used as async validators in the form configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API integration is complete with proper error handling  
  The ApiService methods for signup, isNameTaken, and isEmailTaken are implemented. The AuthEffects class correctly maps successful responses to signupSuccess and catches errors to dispatch signupFailure.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm the form layout matches the horizontal form structure specified  
  While the code uses custom components (e.g., <app-form-field>) for layout and error display, there is no explicit implementation or styling that indicates a horizontal form structure (such as grid or row/column classes) is used.  
  Explanation: The provided markup suggests a vertical layout, and no specific horizontal alignment is apparent in the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page has proper document title setting functionality  
  The SignupComponent’s ngOnInit method sets the document title to "Signup - PodBaby" using the Title service.
