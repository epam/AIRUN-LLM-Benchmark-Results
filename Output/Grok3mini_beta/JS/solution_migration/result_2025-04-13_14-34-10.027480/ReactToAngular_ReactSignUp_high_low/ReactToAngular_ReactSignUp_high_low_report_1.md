I have the following application code that needs to migrate:

  }

  if (!email || !validator.isEmail(email)) {
    errors.email = 'A valid email address is required';
  }

  if (!password || password.length < 6) {

## Run 1:
### Thoughts:
First, the task is to migrate the provided React code to Angular 14.x. The code includes a Signup component and a FormGroup component. I need to create equivalent Angular components.

Key elements from the React code:

- Signup component uses Redux Form for form handling, with synchronous and asynchronous validation.

- It has a handleSubmit method that calls an API to signup and dispatches an action.

- There's a FormGroup component that handles field-level error display using React Bootstrap.

Architecture requirements:

- Use @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management.

- Split large files into separate components or functions.

- Maintain validation logic.

For form implementation:

- Use Angular Reactive Forms.

- Implement sync and async validation.

- Preserve validation rules.

Component structure:

- Create Angular components for Signup and FormGroup.

- Use lifecycle hooks appropriately.

Routing:

- Convert Link to Angular Router's routerLink.

API integration:

- Use HttpClient for API calls, convert promises to observables.

UI:

- Convert React Bootstrap to Angular equivalents. I might need to use ng-bootstrap or similar for Bootstrap components in Angular.

Code quality:

- Optimize and follow best practices.

Deliverable:

- Return code in markdown code snippets, no comments or explanations.

I need to plan the Angular structure.

First, since we're using @ngrx/store, I need to set up state management for authentication. The React code has auth actions, so I'll assume there's an auth module with actions and effects.

Let me outline the components:

1. SignupComponent: This will be the main component.

2. FormGroupComponent: This seems like a reusable form field component. In Angular, I can make it a component that takes input and displays errors.

In the React code, FormGroup is a functional component that wraps an input and shows errors. In Angular, I can create a similar component.

For the form, I'll use ReactiveFormsModule.

Validation:

- Sync validation: name, email, password with specific rules.

- Async validation: check if name and email are already in use via API.

In Angular, I can use Validators for sync validation and a custom async validator for async checks.

For state management, when the form is submitted, it calls api.signup and then dispatches an action. In Angular with @ngrx, I should dispatch an action to trigger an effect that handles the API call.

So, in the SignupComponent, on submit, instead of calling handleSubmit directly, I should dispatch a Signup action, and let an effect handle the API call.

Similarly, for async validation, I need to make API calls to check name and email availability.

In Angular Reactive Forms, async validators return observables or promises.

I can create async validators that use HttpClient to call the API.

But the API calls are to api.isName and api.isEmail, which I need to migrate.

Assuming api is migrated, I'll use HttpClient in Angular.

First, I need to set up the services.

Let me think about the files I need to create.

- signup.component.ts: The main signup component.

- form-group.component.ts: A component for each form field.

- Perhaps a auth.service or api.service for API calls.

- Actions and effects for @ngrx.

The task says "Assume all non-provided code has been migrated with the same contract", so I can assume that auth actions and api functions are available in Angular form.

But I need to use @ngrx/store, so I should define the actions.

Let me sketch the Angular version.

First, for the SignupComponent.

In Angular, it will be a class component or perhaps use OnPush change detection.

I'll use Reactive Forms.

Import necessary modules.

For routing, use Router from '@angular/router'.

For Bootstrap, I'll assume we're using ng-bootstrap, as it's common for Angular.

So, import NgbModule or specific components.

In the React code, it uses Button and Input from react-bootstrap. In Angular, ng-bootstrap has NgbInput and NgbButton, but actually, ng-bootstrap might not have direct equivalents; it has components like NgbAlert, but for form inputs, it might use native Bootstrap classes.

ng-bootstrap provides Angular directives for Bootstrap components. For example, it has NgbButton, but for form inputs, it's often just using Bootstrap CSS with Angular forms.

In the FormGroup component, it's using Input from react-bootstrap, which likely adds Bootstrap styling.

In Angular, I can create a component that uses Bootstrap classes.

To keep it simple, I'll use Angular's form controls with Bootstrap classes.

Now, for the FormGroup component: it's a wrapper that shows error messages based on field state.

In Angular, I can create a FormGroupComponent that takes a FormControl as input and displays the error if touched and invalid.

In Reactive Forms, we usually bind form controls in the template.

I can create a custom form control or a directive, but for simplicity, I'll make it a component that accepts the form control and the input element.

Perhaps better to use a component that contains the input and error message.

Similar to how it's done in React.

So, in Angular, I can have a FormFieldComponent that takes the form control name, label, etc., but in this case, it's simple.

Looking at the React code, FormGroup is passed the field object from redux-form, which has value, error, touched, etc.

In Angular Reactive Forms, I can pass the FormControl instance.

So, in the SignupComponent, I'll have a FormGroup instance, and for each field, I'll use the FormFieldComponent, passing the FormControl.

Then in FormFieldComponent, I can handle the display.

Now, for validation.

Sync validation: I need to create a validator function similar to the React one.

In Angular, I can create a custom validator.

For async validation, a custom async validator.

The async validation checks both name and email, and it's done on blur for those fields.

In Angular, I can set async validators on specific controls.

In the React code, asyncValidate is set for the form, and asyncBlurFields specify which fields trigger async validation on blur.

In Angular, I can set async validators on individual controls, and they can be triggered on change or blur.

By default, async validators run when the control is dirty, but I can control when they run.

To mimic the behavior, I can set async validators on name and email controls, and perhaps use valueChanges or blur events to trigger them.

But Angular's async validators are typically run when the control's value changes, but I can make them depend on the value.

In the React code, asyncValidate returns a promise that checks both email and name if they are set.

And it's called via Promise.all.

In Angular, for a form control, an async validator should return an observable or promise that resolves to validation errors or null.

For multiple async validations, I might need to handle it per control or for the form.

In this case, since name and email have their own async checks, I can set separate async validators for each control.

For example, for name control, an async validator that checks if name is taken.

Similarly for email.

And the sync validators as well.

In the submit handler, handle the form submission.

Now, for state management with @ngrx.

When the form is submitted and valid, I should dispatch a Signup action.

Then, an effect will handle the API call using HttpClient, and on success, dispatch a success action, etc.

In the React code, after signup, it calls this.actions.signupComplete, which probably updates the store.

So, in Angular, similar.

First, I need to define the actions.

Assuming I have an auth.actions.ts with Signup action, etc.

But since it's not provided, I'll need to include it in the code.

The task is to provide the migrated code, so I should include the necessary parts.

But to keep it focused, perhaps I can assume the actions are defined elsewhere, but I need to use them.

Looking at the deliverable, I need to provide complete implementation, so I should include the actions and effects as well, or at least the parts relevant to this component.

The instruction says "Provide complete implementation", so I'll need to include the Signup component, FormGroup component, and perhaps the auth module parts.

But to not overcomplicate, I'll focus on the components and mention the store usage.

I need to split large files, so perhaps have separate files for components.

In the response, I'll provide code snippets in markdown.

Let me outline the files:

- signup.component.ts

- form-field.component.ts (renamed from FormGroup to avoid confusion with Angular's FormGroup)

- auth.actions.ts (define actions)

- auth.effects.ts (define effects for signup)

- Perhaps a auth.service for API calls, but since API is assumed migrated, I can use a service.

In the React code, there's an api module, so in Angular, I'll have an ApiService with methods like signup, isName, isEmail.

I'll need to create that or assume it.

To make it complete, I'll include a simple ApiService.

For HttpClient, I need to import it.

Now, for routing: in the Signup component, there's a Link to "/login/", so in Angular, use routerLink.

Also, the DocumentTitle is used to set the page title. In Angular, I can use Title service from @angular/platform-browser.

So, in ngOnInit, set the title.

Now, let's think about the FormFieldComponent.

In React, it's a functional component that takes field prop and children.

In Angular, I'll make it a component with @Input() control: AbstractControl; or something.

Then in the template, show the input and error.

But in the React code, the input is passed as children, so in Angular, I can do similar, but it's easier to have the input inside the component or use content projection.

Use ng-content to project the input.

Similar to React.

So, in FormFieldComponent template:

<input [formControl]="control" ... > or better, use ng-content for the input, and add the error message.

In the React code, the input is passed as children, and FormGroup adds the bsStyle and help-block.

In Angular, I can have a component that wraps the input and adds classes based on control state.

But since Angular doesn't have a direct equivalent to react-bootstrap's Input, I'll use a div with Bootstrap classes.

For example:

template:

<div [ngClass]="{'has-error': control.invalid && control.touched, 'has-success': control.valid && control.touched}">

  <ng-content></ng-content> // this would be the input

  <span class as="help-block" *ngIf="control.invalid && control.touched">{{ control.errors | someErrorPipe or directly access }}</span>

</div>

In the React code, the error is field.error, which is a string.

In Angular, control.errors is an object, so I need to display the appropriate error message.

In the sync validation, errors are strings, but in Angular, validators return objects like { required: true }, but I can customize to return string or use a custom error object.

To match, I can make custom validators that return { [key]: string } or something.

I could have a method to get the error message.

Perhaps in the FormFieldComponent, based on the error key, display the message.

But the error messages are specific, like 'Name must be between 3 and 60 characters'.

In Angular, when defining validators, I can create custom validators that return specific error objects.

For example, for name, a validator that checks length and returns { minlength: 'Name must be at least 3 characters' } or better, use built-in validators and customize the message.

Built-in validators return { required: true }, etc., so I need a way to map to messages.

One way is to have a error message service or a pipe that takes the control and returns the error message.

To keep it simple, I can set the error message in the validator.

Custom validators can return any object.

So, I can create a custom validator for name that returns { nameLength: 'Name must be between 3 and 60 characters' } if invalid, etc.

Then in the template, check control.errors.nameLength, etc.

But that might lead to many error keys.

I can have the validator return a string, but Angular validators typically return ValidationErrors object.

ValidationErrors is { [key: string]: any }, so I can return { error: 'message' } or specific keys.

Perhaps best to return specific keys like { minLength: true } and then in the component, map to messages.

But to preserve the exact messages, I can create custom validators that return the full message.

For example:

const nameValidator = (control: AbstractControl): ValidationErrors | null => {
  const value = control.value;
  if (!value || value.length < 3 || value.length > 60) {
    return { nameInvalid: 'Name must be between 3 and 60 characters in length' };
  }
  return null;
};

Then in the template, if control.hasError('nameInvalid'), show control.getError('nameInvalid')

Similarly for other fields.

For async validators, return { nameTaken: 'This name is already in use' } or null.

Same for email.

Now, for the async part, the validator needs to call the API.

So, the async validator will depend on HttpClient.

I need to inject HttpClient into the validator, but validators are functions, not services.

In Angular, to have dependencies in validators, I can create a factory function that injects the service.

For example:

export function nameAsyncValidator(apiService: ApiService) {
  return (control: AbstractControl): Observable<ValidationErrors | null> => {
    if (!control.value) {
      return of(null);
    }
    return apiService.isNameTaken(control.value).pipe(
      map(result => result ? { nameTaken: 'This name is already in use' } : null)
    );
  };
}

Assuming apiService.isNameTaken returns an observable that emits true if taken.

In the React code, api.isName returns a promise that resolves to { data: true/false }, I assume.

In Angular, I'll make ApiService methods return observables.

Similarly for email.

Now, in the form, for the name control, set validators: [Validators.required, nameValidator, nameAsyncValidator(apiService)]

nameValidator is sync, nameAsyncValidator is async.

Same for email and password.

Password has only sync validation.

In the React code, async validation is triggered on blur for name and email.

In Angular, async validators run when the control is changed, but I can add a blur event to mark as touched or something.

By default, when the control is touched (e.g., on blur), the validation runs.

In Angular, when a control is touched, the status changes, and async validation can run.

To mimic exactly, I might need to ensure async validation runs on blur.

But in practice, Angular's async validators run when the value changes, and the control is marked as dirty.

I can use the updateOn: 'blur' option for the form control to run validation on blur.

In Angular, for form controls, I can set { updateOn: 'blur' } so that validation updates on blur event.

Perfect, so for name and email, I can set updateOn: 'blur' to match the asyncBlurFields behavior.

In the form builder, when creating the form, for name and email controls, add { updateOn: 'blur' }.

Now, for the submit handler.

In React, handleSubmit is from redux-form, which handles validation and then calls the onSubmit.

In Angular, I'll have a method onSubmit that checks if the form is valid, and if so, dispatches the Signup action.

With @ngrx, I should dispatch an action instead of calling API directly.

So, in the component, on submit, if form valid, store.dispatch(new Signup({ name, email, password }))

Then, an effect listens to Signup action and calls the API.

On success, dispatches SignupSuccess or something.

Also, in the React code, after signup, it redirects or something? Not shown, but probably handled in the action.

In the render, there's a link to login, but no redirect after signup.

Assuming the store handles any redirection.

Now, for the UI.

In the template, use Bootstrap classes.

For the button, use a button with class "btn btn-primary".

For inputs, add form-control class.

For the icon, there's <Icon icon="sign-in" />, I need an equivalent. Perhaps use a icon component or font-awesome.

Assume there's an IconComponent in Angular.

Or use direct HTML.

To keep it simple, I'll use a span with class or something.

In the code, it's imported from '../components/icon', so assume it's migrated.

I'll use it as is, but in Angular, it would be a component.

Similarly for other parts.

Now, for the DocumentTitle, use Title service.

In ngOnInit, this.title.setTitle('Signup - App Name') or something.

getTitle is imported from './utils', probably returns the title with app name.

Assume it's available or hardcode it.

To be complete, I can define a getTitle function or use a service.

But for simplicity, I'll hardcode or assume.

In the code, getTitle('Signup'), so perhaps it's a utility.

I'll add a simple function or use string.

Now, let's think about splitting files.

I need signup.component.ts, form-field.component.ts (renamed), and perhaps the validators.

I can define the validators in a separate file, like validators.ts.

Also, the ApiService.

And for @ngrx, auth.actions.ts and auth.effects.ts.

I need to provide the code.

In the response, I'll have multiple code snippets.

Start with the components.

First, create the FormFieldComponent.

In Angular:

import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';

import { AbstractControl } from '@angular/forms';

@Component({

  selector: 'app-form-field',

  template: `

    <div [ngClass]="{'has-error': control.invalid && control.touched, 'has-success': control.valid && control.touched}">

      <ng-content></ng-content>

      <span class="help-block" *ngIf="control.invalid && control.touched">

        {{ getErrorMessage() }}

      </span>

    </div>

  `

})

export class FormFieldComponent {

  @Input() control: AbstractControl;

  getErrorMessage(): string {

    if (this.control.errors) {

      if (this.control.errors.nameInvalid) return this.control.errors.nameInvalid;

      if (this.control.errors.emailInvalid) return this.control.errors.emailInvalid; // need to handle specific errors

      // better to have a way to get the error

      // since errors can have different keys, I need to check

      for (const key in this.control.errors) {

        if (this.control.errors.hasOwnProperty(key)) {

          return this.control.errors[key]; // assuming the error is a string

        }

      }

    }

    return '';

  }

}

In the validators, I'm returning objects like { nameInvalid: 'message' }, so the value is the message string.

So, in getErrorMessage, I can return the first error message or something.

But in this case, since each control has specific possible errors, I can handle it per control, but in a generic component, it's tricky.

I could pass the error key or make it specific.

Another way is to have the error message logic in the component or use a pipe.

But to keep it simple, I'll assume that the error object has a string value, and display it.

In Angular, typically, errors are keys, and messages are defined elsewhere.

But to match the React code, where field.error is a string, I'll make the validators return { error: 'message' } or specific.

In the asyncValidate in React, it returns { name: 'message' } or { email: 'message' }, but for sync, it's similar.

In validate function, it sets errors.name, errors.email, etc.

In redux-form, the field.error is set to the string.

In Angular, to have control.errors be a string, but ValidationErrors is an object.

I can make the validator return a single key with the message.

For example, for name control, the sync validator can return { invalid: 'Name must be between 3 and 60 characters' } if invalid due to length, or { required: 'Name is required' } if required.

Then in getErrorMessage, check the errors.

But for required, it's a common key.

Perhaps use built-in validators where possible.

For name: Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3), Validators.maxLength(60)

But the error message is custom.

Built-in validators return { required: true }, { minlength: { requiredLength: 3, actualLength: x } }, etc.

So in getErrorMessage, I can have logic:

if (control.hasError('required')) return 'This field is required';

if (control.hasError('minlength')) return `Must be at least ${control.getError('minlength').requiredLength} characters`;

similarly for maxlength, email, etc.

For email, use Validators.email, which returns { email: true }, and message 'A valid email address is required'.

For async errors, { nameTaken: true }, message 'This name is already in use'.

In getErrorMessage, handle different error keys.

Make FormFieldComponent generic, and in getErrorMessage, switch based on error key.

Since the component is used for different fields, it needs to know what error to display.

Add a method that returns the message based on the control.

Code it in FormFieldComponent.

For example:

getErrorMessage(): string | null {

  const errors = this.control.errors;

  if (!errors) return null;

  if (errors.required) return 'This field is required'; // but in the validation, required is handled, but in React, the message is specific per field, but in this component, it's generic.

In the React validate function, for name, error is 'Name must be between 3 and 60 characters', which includes the length check, but doesn't have a separate required message; if !name, it sets the error.

In Angular, I can combine the validators.

For name, a custom validator that checks required and length.

Similarly for others.

Define custom validators that encapsulate the logic and return a specific message.

For example:

export const nameValidator = (control: AbstractControl): ValidationErrors | null => {

  const value = control.value;

  if (!value) {

    return { required: 'Name is required' }; // but 'Name is required' is specific, while in React it's part of the same message? No, in React, if !name, it sets 'Name must be between 3 and 60 characters', which implies it's required, but the message doesn't say "required", it says the length constraint.

In React validate:

if (!name or name.length < 3 or name.length > 60) errors.name = 'Name must be between 3 and 60 characters';

So if name is empty, it still says "must be between 3 and 60", which is a bit misleading, as it doesn't explicitly say required, but the message implies it.

Similarly for email and password.

For email, if !email or not valid email, error 'A valid email address is required'.

For password, if !password or length <6, 'Password must be at least 6 characters'.

In Angular, I can do similar custom validators.

For name:

export const nameValidator = (control: AbstractControl): ValidationErrors | null => {

  const value = control.value;

  if (!value || value.length < 3 || value.length > 60) {

    return { nameInvalid: 'Name must be between 3 and 60 characters in length' };

  }

  return null;

};

For email:

export const emailValidator = (control: AbstractControl): ValidationErrors | null => {

  const value = control.value;

  if (!value || !validator.isEmail(value)) { // need the validator library, or use Angular's email validator.

In Angular, I can use Validators.email, but it only checks if it's email format, not if it's required.

For required, I can use Validators.required separately.

But in the message, if not provided or invalid, same message.

So for email, I can use a custom validator that checks both.

export const emailValidator = (control: AbstractControl): ValidationErrors | null => {

  const value = control.value;

  if (!value) {

    return { emailInvalid: 'A valid email address is required' };

  }

  if (!/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/.test(value)) { // simple email regex, or use a library

  In Angular, Validators.email uses a regex, I can use that or import a validator library.

To keep it simple, I can use Validators.required and Validators.email, and in the error message, check which error.

But for email, if required error, message 'A valid email address is required', but Validators.required would set { required: true }, and Validators.email { email: true }.

Then in getErrorMessage, for a control with multiple validators, I can check:

if (control.hasError('required')) return 'This field is required'; but the message is specific.

Perhaps best to have per-field error handling.

Since the FormFieldComponent is generic, I can pass the field name or something to customize the message.

But that might be overkill.

I can make the error message part of the control by using a custom value.

But simplest is to use built-in validators and have a map in getErrorMessage.

For example, in FormFieldComponent, have a input for the error messages or hardcode for now.

Since the component is used in different contexts, I can make getErrorMessage return based on error keys with generic messages, but to match exactly, I'll use custom validators with specific error messages.

So, for each field, define a custom validator that returns the full message.

For name control, set validator: nameValidator, which returns { invalid: 'Name must be between 3 and 60 characters' } if invalid.

Then in getErrorMessage, if control.hasError('invalid') return control.getError('invalid')

Similarly for other fields.

But the error key 'invalid' is generic, so for name, it's nameInvalid, for email emailInvalid, etc.

In the validator, I can return { [specificKey]: message }

For name, { nameLength: 'message' }, but since it's the only error for name, I can use 'invalid'.

Or use a key like 'customError'.

But to make it work, in FormFieldComponent, I can assume that if there's an error, it's an object with a string value or something.

Define the validators to return { error: 'message' }, then in getErrorMessage, return control.errors.error if exists.

Yes, that's simple.

In custom validator, return { error: 'the message' } or null.

For async validators, return { error: 'message' } or null.

In getErrorMessage, if control.errors and control.errors.error, return control.errors.error.

That way, it's consistent.

For built-in validators, I can do the same, but for email, I can use a custom validator.

For email, the validation includes both required and format.

In nameValidator, it checks !value or length invalid.

Similarly for email.

So in Angular, I'll define custom validators for each field type.

But since the FormFieldComponent is generic, with { error: 'message' }, it works.

In the async validator, it might return { error: 'This name is already in use' }, but in the sync validator, it's { error: 'Name must be between...' }, so when displaying, it will show the message.

In the form, a control can have multiple errors, but in this case, the custom validator is comprehensive, so only one error per control.

Good.

Now for the async validator, it needs the ApiService.

So, when creating the form, I need to provide the async validator with the service.

In Angular, when using form builder, I can set asyncValidators.

AsyncValidators can be functions that return observable.

I can create the async validator functions that inject the service.

But in the component, I can define them.

For example, in SignupComponent, define the async validators.

Like:

nameAsyncValidator = (control: AbstractControl) => {
  return this.apiService.isNameTaken(control.value).pipe(
    map(taken => taken ? { error: 'This name is already in use' } : null)
  );
}

Similarly for email.

Then when creating the form, set asyncValidator: this.nameAsyncValidator for the name control, with updateOn: 'blur'.

AsyncValidator is per control, and it's a function or array.

Yes.

Now for the ApiService, I need to define it.

Assuming it has methods like isNameTaken(name: string): Observable<boolean>, isEmailTaken(email: string): Observable<boolean>, signup(name: string, email: string, password: string): Observable<any>

Using HttpClient.

Also, for the store, I need actions.

Define AuthActions.

import { createAction, props } from '@ngrx/store';

export const signup = createAction('[Signup] Signup', props<{ name: string, email: string, password: string }>());

export const signupSuccess = createAction('[Signup] Signup Success', props<{ user: any }>());

export const signupFailure = createAction('[Signup] Signup Failure', props<{ error: any }>());

Then an effect:

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

import { Actions, createEffect, ofType }  from '@ngrx/effects';

import { of } from 'rxjs';

import { map, mergeMap, catchError } from 'rxjs/operators';

import { ApiService } from './api.service';

import * as AuthActions from './auth.actions';

@Injectable()

export class AuthEffects {

  signup$ = createEffect(() => this.actions$.pipe(

    ofType(AuthActions.signup),

    mergeMap(action => this.apiService.signup(action.name, action.email, action.password).pipe(

      map(user => AuthActions.signupSuccess({ user })),

      catchError(error => of(AuthActions.signupFailure({ error })))

    ))

  ));

  constructor(private actions$: Actions, private apiService: ApiService) {}

}

In the SignupComponent, inject Store and ApiService if needed, but for async validators, I need ApiService.

For async validators, I can inject ApiService in the component and define the validators there.

Now for the template.

In Angular, the template will be similar.

Use formGroup and formControlName.

For the button, on click, call onSubmit, which is handleSubmit from the form.

In Angular, I can bind (ngSubmit) to a method.

Also, disable button when submitting or invalid.

In React, button is disabled when submitting.

In Angular, I can add [disabled]="form.invalid || submitting"

Need a submitting flag.

In the component, have a submitting boolean, set to true on submit start, false on end.

But with @ngrx, when I dispatch signup action, I can select from store if it's submitting.

Assume there's a state with isLoading or something.

To keep it simple, I can handle it in the component.

Since the effect handles the API, I can select from store the auth state, which has isLoading.

Assume the auth state has a loading property.

In the component, use store.select to get isLoading for signup.

But to simplify, perhaps add a local submitting flag.

In ngOnInit, subscribe to store.select or something, but for now, I'll use a local variable.

In handleSubmit, set submitting true, dispatch action, and on success or failure, set false, but since it's handled by effect, I need to listen to actions.

Easier to have the component dispatch the action and handle the state.

I can make the form submission dispatch the action, and use a selector to get the submitting state.

In SignupComponent, inject Store, and select auth.loading or something.

First, define the auth state.

Assume in auth.reducer, there's a state with loading: boolean, etc.

For example, when signup action, set loading true, on success or failure, set false.

In the component, use async pipe or subscribe to isLoading.

In the template, [disabled]="form.invalid || (isLoading$ | async)"

Where isLoading$ is an observable from store.select.

Yes.

Now for the icon, assume there's an IconComponent.

I'll use it as <app-icon icon="sign-in"></app-icon>

Similarly for other parts.

Now for the code.

First, I need to provide the code in markdown.

I'll have several files.

- api.service.ts

- auth.actions.ts

- auth.effects.ts

- auth.reducer.ts (briefly, to have the state)

- validators.ts (for custom validators)

- form-field.component.ts

- signup.component.ts

And perhaps the module, but not necessary.

For the form, I need to import ReactiveFormsModule, etc., but in the component code, it's implied.

Now, for the async validators in signup.component, I need ApiService.

First, define the custom sync validators in a separate file, say validators.ts.

export const nameValidator = (control: AbstractControl): ValidationErrors | null => {
  const value = control.value;
  if (!value || value.length < 3 || value.length > 60) {
    return { error: 'Name must be between 3 and 60 characters in length' };
  }
  return null;
};

export const emailValidator = (control: AbstractControl): ValidationErrors | null => {
  const value = control.value;
  if (!value || !/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/.test(value)) { // simple regex, or use validator library
    return { error: 'A valid email address is required' };
  }
  return null;
};

export const passwordValidator = (control: AbstractControl): ValidationErrors | null => {
  const value = control.value;
  if (!value || value.length < 6) {
    return { error: 'Password must be at least 6 characters' };
  }
  return null;
};

For email, the regex is simple; in a real app, use a better one or library, but ok.

Now for async validators, they will be defined in the component since they depend on ApiService.

Now, ApiService.

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class ApiService {
  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  isNameTaken(name: string): Observable<boolean> {
    return this.http.get<{ data: boolean }>(`/api/isName?name=${name}`).pipe(map(res => res.data));
  }

  isEmailTaken(email: string): Observable<boolean> {
    return this.http.get<{ data: boolean }>(`/api/isEmail?email=${email}`).pipe(map(res => res.data));
  }

  signup(name: string, email: string, password: string): Observable<any> {
    return this.http.post('/api/signup', { name, email, password });
  }
}

Assuming the API endpoints.

Now, for auth actions and effects.

auth.actions.ts

import { createAction, props } from '@ngrx/store';

export const signup = createAction('[Signup Page] Signup', props<{ name: string, email: string, password: string }>());

export const signupSuccess = createAction('[Signup API] Signup Success', props<{ user: any }>());

export const signupFailure = createAction('[Signup API] Signup Failure', props<{ error: any }>());

auth.effects.ts as above.

auth.reducer.ts, briefly:

import { createReducer, on } from '@ngrx/store';

import * as AuthActions from './auth.actions';

export interface AuthState {
  loading: boolean;
  // other properties
}

export const initialState: AuthState = {
  loading: false,
};

export const authReducer = createReducer(
  initialState,
  on(AuthActions.signup, state => ({ ...state, loading: true })),
  on(AuthActions.signupSuccess, state => ({ ...state, loading: false })),
  on(AuthActions.signupFailure, state => ({ ...state, loading: false })),
);

Now, for FormFieldComponent.

import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';

import { AbstractControl, ValidationErrors } from '@angular/forms';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-form-field',
  template: `
    <div [ngClass]="{'has-error': control.invalid && control.touched, 'has-success': control.valid && control.touched}">
      <ng-content></ng-content>
      <span class="help-block" *ngIf="control.invalid && control.touched && control.errors?.error">{{ control.errors.error }}</span>
    </div>
  `,
  styles: [] // can add styles if needed
})
export class FormFieldComponent {
  @Input() control!: AbstractControl;
}

In the template, I'm assuming control.errors.error is the message string.

Now, for SignupComponent.

import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

import { FormBuilder, FormGroup, Validators, AbstractControl, ValidationErrors } from '@angular/forms';

import { Store } from '@ngrx/store';

import { Router } from '@angular/router';

import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

import { ApiService } from '../api.service'; // assume path

import * as AuthActions from '../auth.actions';

import { AppState } from '../app.state'; // assume the state interface

// import validators

import { nameValidator, emailValidator, passwordValidator } from '../validators';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-signup',
  template: `
    <div>
      <h2>Join PodBaby today.</h2>
      <hr />
      <p class="lead">As a member you can subscribe to podcast feeds and keep track of your favorite episodes.</p>
      <form [formGroup]="signupForm" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()">
        <app-form-field [control]="signupForm.get('name')">
          <input type="text" formControlName="name" class="form-control" placeholder="Name" />
        </app-form-field>
        <app-form-field [control]="signupForm.get('email')">
          <input type="email" formControlName="email" class="form-control" placeholder="Email address" />
        </app-form-field>
        <app-form-field [control]="signupForm.get('password')">
          <input type="password" formControlName="password" class="form-control" placeholder="Password" />
        </app-form-field>
        <button type="submit" [disabled]="signupForm.invalid || (isLoading$ | async)" class="btn btn-primary form-control">
          <app-icon icon="sign-in"></app-icon> Signup
        </button>
      </form>
      <p><a routerLink="/login">Already a member? Log in here.</a></p>
    </div>
  `,
})
export class SignupComponent implements OnInit {
  signupForm: FormGroup;
  isLoading$: Observable<boolean>;

  constructor(
    private fb: FormBuilder,
    private apiService: ApiService,
    private store: Store<AppState>,
    private router: Router, // might not be needed here
    private titleService: Title // for setting title
  ) {
    this.isLoading$ = this.store.select(state => state.auth.loading); // assume state.auth.loading
  }

  ngOnInit() {
    this.titleService.setTitle('Signup - PodBaby'); // or use getTitle if available
    this.signupForm = this.fb.group({
      name: [{
        value: '',
        disabled: false
      }, {
        validators: nameValidator,
        asyncValidators: this.nameAsyncValidator.bind(this),
        updateOn: 'blur'
      }],
      email: [{
        value: '',
        disabled: false
      }, {
        validators: emailValidator,
        asyncValidators: this.emailAsyncValidator.bind(this),
        updateOn: 'blur'
      }],
      password: ['', passwordValidator]
    });
  }

  nameAsyncValidator(control: AbstractControl): Observable<ValidationErrors | null> {
    if (!control.value) {
      return of(null); // don't validate if empty
    }
    return this.apiService.isNameTaken(control.value).pipe(
      map(taken => taken ? { error: 'This name is already in use' } : null)
    );
  }

  emailAsyncValidator(control: AbstractControl): Observable<ValidationErrors | null> {
    if (!control.value) {
      return of(null); // don't validate if empty
    }
    return this.apiService.isEmailTaken(control.value).pipe(
      map(taken => taken ? { error: 'This email is already in use' } : null)
    );
  }

  onSubmit() {
    if (this.signupForm.valid) {
      const { name, email, password } = this.signupForm.value;
      this.store.dispatch(AuthActions.signup({ name, email, password }));
    }
  }
}

In the async validators, I used bind(this) to have access to apiService.

In the form builder, for asyncValidators, it's a function, so binding should work.

Now, for the validators.ts file.

import { AbstractControl, ValidationErrors } from '@angular/forms';

export const nameValidator = (control: AbstractControl): ValidationErrors | null => {
  const value = control.value;
  if (!value || value.length < 3 || value.length > 60) {
    return { error: 'Name must be between 3 and 60 characters in length' };
  }
  return null;
};

export const emailValidator = (control: AbstractControl): ValidationErrors | null => {
  const value = control.value;
  if (!value || !validator.isEmail(value)) { // need to import validator or use regex
    // in React, it uses validator.isEmail, so in Angular, I can import the same library or use Angular's
    // for simplicity, use a regex or assume validator is available
    // let's use a simple regex
    if (!/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/.test(value)) {
      return { error: 'A valid email address is required' };
    }
  }
  return null;
};

In the code, if !value, it returns error, else if not email, return error, but in the message, it's the same.

In Angular, with the custom validator, it's fine.

Similarly for password.

export const passwordValidator = (control: AbstractControl): ValidationErrors | null => {
  const value = control.value;
  if (!value || value.length < 6) {
    return { error: 'Password must be at least 6 characters' };
  }
  return null;
};

In emailValidator, I'm using a regex, but in React, it uses validator.isEmail, which might be more accurate. For this migration, it's ok.

Now, for the FormFieldComponent, in the template, I have <ng-content>, and the input is projected, with formControlName.

In Angular, when using ng-content, the formControlName should be on the input, which is fine.

Also, the bsStyle is handled by ngClass with has-error and has-success, which adds the Bootstrap classes for feedback.

Assuming Bootstrap CSS is included.

For the button, I used btn btn-primary, and assumed app-icon component.

In the original, it's Button from react-bootstrap, which might have more props, but this should be similar.

Now, I think that's mostly it.

For the deliverable, I need to provide the code in markdown code snippets.

I'll have:

- form-field.component.ts

- signup.component.ts

- validators.ts

- api.service.ts (partially)

- auth.actions.ts

- auth.effects.ts

- Perhaps the reducer, but maybe not necessary for the component.

To make it complete, I'll include the key parts.

Since the task is to migrate the provided code, which is signup.js and form.js, I should provide the Angular equivalents.

Also, include the necessary imports and setups.

In the response, I'll list the files.

Finally, ensure no TODOs and follow best practices.
