# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The code clearly demonstrates Angular 14.x features and syntax, including imports from `@angular/core`, component decorators, and Angular-specific templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
  
  The code includes proper imports from @ngrx/store, defines a store module in the app module, and components interact with the store through actions, selectors, and the store service.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
  
  @ngrx/effects is properly imported and implemented for handling side effects, specifically for persisting todos to local storage when state changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
  
  The code includes well-defined actions (todo.actions.ts), reducers (todo.reducer.ts), and selectors (todo.selectors.ts) that handle all the required functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
  
  All components use the @Component decorator correctly, and @Input decorators are used for property binding (e.g., in TodoItemComponent).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators
  
  React refs are properly replaced with @ViewChild decorators, as seen in TodoItemComponent for accessing the edit input element.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
  
  The code uses @Input() for property binding (e.g., todo and isEditing props in TodoItemComponent). While not many @Output() EventEmitters are explicitly shown, the application leverages the store for most event handling which is an acceptable pattern.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
  
  Business logic is moved to the store (actions, reducers, effects) and utility functions are provided in dedicated files, following Angular's service pattern.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
  
  Dependency injection is correctly implemented throughout the application, with services like Store and ActivatedRoute injected into components through constructors.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
  
  The code uses ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush where appropriate to optimize performance, as seen in multiple component definitions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
  
  Angular Router is properly implemented with routes defined in the app module and the RouterModule imported. Components react to route changes through the ActivatedRoute service.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code follows Angular style guide conventions with proper naming, file organization, and syntax patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
  
  TypeScript interfaces are defined and used throughout the application, specifically the ITodo interface for todo items.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
  
  All JSX templates are properly converted to Angular HTML templates with appropriate Angular-specific syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf, event bindings).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
  
  React event handlers are correctly replaced with Angular event bindings (e.g., (click), (keyup.enter), (change)).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs
  
  The code does not contain any TODO comments or incomplete implementations.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules
  
  The answer explicitly mentions that lazy loading was not implemented: "No lazy loading was implemented as the app is small, but it's noted as optional for scalability." The requirement states that lazy loading should be verified, and it's not present in the provided solution.
