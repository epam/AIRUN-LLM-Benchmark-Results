# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items

    The answer claims to have implemented this functionality, showing todo items with the TodoListComponent and TodoItemComponent. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:
    
    In the `todo-list.component.ts`, there's a reference to `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` without proper import, and in multiple other component files the same issue occurs. Also, the app would need a proper initialization in the AppComponent to load todos from local storage and display them, which seems to be present but has some implementation issues.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented

    The NewTodoComponent handles adding new todos with an input field and keyup.enter event that triggers the addTodo function, which dispatches the addTodo action with a uuid and the trimmed title. The implementation is mostly correct, but is missing the ChangeDetectionStrategy import.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works

    The TodoItemComponent includes an input checkbox with the correct event binding for toggling todo completion status, and it dispatches the toggleTodo action with the todo id. The TodoComponent also includes functionality to toggle all todos. The implementation looks correct except for some import issues.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented

    The TodoItemComponent handles editing with double-click to start editing, save on blur or enter key, cancel on escape, and updates the edit text on input. The implementation appears correct, with proper actions dispatched to the store, though there are some minor issues with imports and type declarations.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented

    The destroy method in TodoItemComponent dispatches the destroyTodo action with the todo id, and is triggered by clicking the destroy button. The implementation is correct.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented

    The TodoComponent includes a toggle-all checkbox input that dispatches the toggleAll action when changed, with the checked state passed to the action. The implementation appears correct.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works

    The TodoFooterComponent provides links to filter routes, and the TodoComponent subscribes to route data to dispatch the setFilter action. The selectVisibleTodos selector filters todos based on the current filter. The implementation is correct.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items

    The TodoFooterComponent displays the active count in the todo-count span, using a reactive approach with the activeCountData$ observable that transforms the count into an object with count and word properties. The implementation appears correct but uses a custom approach instead of the PluralizePipe that was defined.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items

    The TodoFooterComponent includes a clear-completed button that dispatches the clearCompleted action when clicked, and is only shown when there are completed items. The implementation is correct.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage

    The TodoEffects class includes an effect that saves todos to local storage when relevant actions are dispatched, using the TODO_STORAGE_KEY constant. The AppComponent loads todos from local storage on initialization. The implementation appears correct.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation

    The routes in AppModule match the expected structure with paths for '/', '/active', and '/completed', all using the TodoComponent with different filter data. The implementation is correct.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states

    The TodoComponent conditionally displays the main section and footer based on the todos length and counts, using *ngIf directives. The implementation appears correct but could benefit from more explicit empty state handling.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly

    The NewTodoComponent handles form submission via the keyup.enter event, clearing the input field after adding a todo, and only adding todos with non-empty titles. The implementation is correct.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships

    The component hierarchy with AppComponent, TodoComponent, NewTodoComponent, TodoListComponent, TodoItemComponent, and TodoFooterComponent maintains appropriate relationships, with parent-child communication handle
