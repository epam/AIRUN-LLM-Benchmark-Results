# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The documentation and code explicitly state that the migration is to Angular 14.x, with supporting files (e.g., app.module.ts) reflecting Angular usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The application imports and configures @ngrx/store (via StoreModule.forRoot) and the state management is handled through defined actions, reducers, and selectors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  The code includes an Effects module (TodoEffects) that uses @ngrx/effects to persist and load data from local storage, satisfying side effects handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  The provided files (todo.actions.ts, todo.reducer.ts, and todo.selectors.ts) show a well-structured implementation of actions, reducers, and selectors.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  Every component is defined with the @Component decorator; properties are marked with @Input, and while @Output is not extensively used, the explanation notes that where needed, EventEmitter would be used for event handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  In the TodoItemComponent, React refs have been correctly replaced by the use of @ViewChild to access the edit input element.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  The components make proper use of @Input() for passing data. Though the code often dispatches actions directly to the store (reducing the need for @Output EventEmitter), the explanation clarifies that callback props were converted where needed. The slight deduction here is due to limited explicit examples of @Output usage.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  While the migration emphasizes moving business logic into the NgRx store and effects (which themselves rely on dependency injection), there is only a brief mention of services (e.g., for utility functions). No standalone Angular service file is provided, but the approach is acceptable in this context. The confidence is a bit lower because explicit service implementations are minimal.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  Dependency injection is used throughout the code (e.g., injecting Store and ActivatedRoute in constructors).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  Multiple components explicitly set ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush, optimizing change detection as required.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  Angular Router is configured with defined routes in app.module.ts and the routing logic is correctly applied.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The file structure, naming, and code organization closely follow Angular best practices. Minor improvements could always be made, but overall the conventions are well maintained.

- **Pass** (85%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  An interface (ITodo) is defined in models/todo.model.ts and type annotations are used in many parts of the code. However, some components use the type "any" for todo objects, which slightly reduces the overall strictness of type maintenance.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  All React JSX templates have been properly rewritten as Angular HTML templates, using Angular-specific syntax like *ngFor, *ngIf, and event bindings.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  The code replaces React event handlers (e.g., onClick, onKeyUp) with Angular event bindings such as (change), (keyup.enter), and (dblclick).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  The answer explicitly mentions that there are no TODO comments in the code, which is verified by the inspection of the provided code snippets.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  The answer explicitly states that lazy loading was not implemented, as the app is considered small and lazy loading was noted as optional for scalability. This does not meet the evaluation step requirement.
