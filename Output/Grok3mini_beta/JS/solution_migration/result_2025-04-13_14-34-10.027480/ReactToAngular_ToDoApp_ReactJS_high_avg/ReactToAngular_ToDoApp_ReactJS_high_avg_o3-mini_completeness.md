# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The Angular implementation uses the selector selectVisibleTodos within the TodoListComponent and an *ngFor loop (with trackBy optimization) to render each todo. This meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The NewTodoComponent listens for the Enter key on its input field and dispatches the addTodo action with a new UUID and title. This confirms that the functionality is implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  Each TodoItemComponent has a checkbox bound to the todoâ€™s completed property, triggering a store dispatch (toggleTodo) on change. Additionally, the "Mark all as complete" input in TodoComponent dispatches toggleAll. Both methods confirm the expected functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent supports entering an editing mode (via dblclick) and provides a text input that handles blur, enter, and escape events to save, cancel, or update the editing state. This correctly implements the editing functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  In TodoItemComponent, a destroy button is provided that dispatches the destroyTodo action, ensuring that todo items can be removed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  The main TodoComponent includes an input of type checkbox with the "toggle-all" class and an event that dispatches the toggleAll action based on its checked state. This meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  The application defines three routes (/, /active, /completed) with route data that set the filter, and the reducer (via setFilter) along with selectors correctly filter the todos based on their completion status.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooterComponent selects the active todo count from the store and displays it, along with proper singular/plural logic using a pipe, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The TodoFooterComponent renders a "Clear completed" button (when the count of completed todos is greater than zero) which, when clicked, dispatches the clearCompleted action. The reducer properly handles removal of completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  The TodoEffects listens for key actions and saves the current todos to local storage. Also, the AppComponent dispatches loadTodos on initialization. This confirms persistence is correctly implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The provided routes (/, /active, /completed) in the RouterModule.forRoot configuration preserve the original URL structure.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  While the code conditionally shows the main section only when there are todos and the footer when there are active/completed items, it does not display additional empty state messaging. However, this behavior is consistent with the original todo application's minimal UI in an empty state. The slight lack of explicit empty-state messaging lowers confidence slightly, but the core requirement is met.  
  Explanation: Some applications may require an explicit empty state view; here, the absence of todos naturally results in only the header and new todo input being visible.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  The NewTodoComponent handles the Enter key event on the input, submitting new todo items efficiently, which is correct for form submission handling in the context of the todo app.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The application is split into logically organized components (TodoComponent, NewTodoComponent, TodoListComponent, TodoItemComponent, and TodoFooterComponent) with clear parent-child relationships, ensuring proper separation of concerns.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  All key functionalities such as adding, editing, toggling, deleting, filtering, and persisting todos are implemented and routed through properly structured actions, reducers, selectors, and effects, preserving the original application's business logic.
