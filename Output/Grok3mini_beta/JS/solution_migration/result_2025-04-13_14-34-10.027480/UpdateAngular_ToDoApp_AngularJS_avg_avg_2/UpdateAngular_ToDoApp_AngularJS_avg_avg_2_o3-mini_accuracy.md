# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The code indicates the use of Angular modules (e.g., NgModule, Component) and explicitly mentions Angular 14.x in both the description and file configurations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
  The code uses ES module syntax with import/export statements throughout, and the migration explicitly replaces RequireJS.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
  The application imports and configures StoreModule (both forRoot and forFeature) and uses store.dispatch/select in multiple components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
  The code includes EffectsModule configuration and defines TodoEffects to handle side effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
  The answer includes complete definitions for actions (todo.actions.ts), reducers (todo.reducer.ts), selectors (todo.selectors.ts), and effects (todo.effects.ts).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
  The TodoStorageService is decorated with @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }), ensuring proper dependency injection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
  The TodoStorageService directly accesses localStorage to get and set the todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
  All components (e.g., AppComponent, TodoComponent, TodoInputComponent, etc.) are correctly defined with the @Component decorator.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
  The custom directives (TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective) employ the @Directive decorator as required.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
  Templates use *ngFor, *ngIf, and other Angular-specific binding syntaxes appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
  Event binding is correctly implemented using (click) and other event binding syntaxes throughout the components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
  Property binding is observed (e.g., [class.completed], [checked]), confirming the usage of Angular binding syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
  The use of lifecycle hooks is evident in components like TodoComponent (ngOnInit) and in directives like TodoFocusDirective (ngOnChanges).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
  The Todo model is defined as an interface in todo.model.ts, ensuring proper type usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
  Components and services receive dependencies via constructor injection, consistent with Angular best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code is modular, well-structured, and splits responsibilities into separate components, services, directives, and store management, aligning with Angular style guidelines.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
  Based on the code provided, there are no obvious errors or warnings. However, without running the application, there remains a slight chance of minor runtime warnings in an untested environment.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
  TypeScript features such as interfaces, types, and decorators are used appropriately throughout the code base.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
  A review of the code reveals no TODO comments or commented-out sections, indicating clean code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design  
  The migration effort clearly breaks down a monolithic AngularJS controller into smaller, focused components and services, adhering to the single responsibility principle.
