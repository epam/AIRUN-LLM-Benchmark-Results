# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verified that the application has a component for displaying the todo list.  
  The provided code includes the TodoListComponent, which is responsible for rendering the list of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirmed that the application has a component for adding new todos.  
  The TodoInputComponent is clearly present and handles adding new todo items.

- **Pass** (100%): Verified that the application has a component for editing existing todos.  
  Editing functionality is implemented within the TodoItemComponent, allowing users to modify existing todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirmed that the application has a component for filtering todos.  
  The filtering is handled through the TodoFooterComponent along with routing and store state management by dispatching a setFilter action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verified that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics.  
  The TodoFooterComponent displays the count of remaining todos, achieving the required statistics display.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirmed that the application implements functionality to add new todos.  
  The TodoInputComponent dispatches an addTodo action on form submission to add new todos to the list.

- **Pass** (100%): Verified that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos.  
  Users can edit todos through the TodoItemComponent; changes are applied via dispatched updateTodo actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirmed that the application implements functionality to delete todos.  
  The code includes a removeTodo method in TodoItemComponent that dispatches the appropriate action for deletion.

- **Pass** (100%): Verified that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed.  
  The toggleCompleted method in TodoItemComponent toggles the completed state by dispatching an updateTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirmed that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed).  
  Filter functionality is provided through Angular routing and the use of selectors filtering the todos based on the current filter state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verified that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete.  
  The TodoListComponent contains a toggleAll method which dispatches the markAll action accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirmed that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos.  
  The clearCompleted button in TodoFooterComponent dispatches the clearCompleted action to remove completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verified that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos.  
  The remaining count is computed via a selector and displayed in the TodoFooterComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirmed that the application persists todos in localStorage.  
  The TodoStorageService encapsulates localStorage handling with getTodos and setTodos methods for persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verified that the application loads persisted todos on initialization.  
  The TodoEffects class uses an effect to load todos from localStorage by dispatching the loadTodosSuccess action upon initialization.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirmed that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing.  
  A TodoEscapeDirective is implemented to listen for Escape key events and call the provided cancellation callback. However, the usage in the template as an attribute (todoEscape="revertEditing()") might not employ Angular’s property binding syntax ([todoEscape]="revertEditing") for passing functions, which may lead to potential issues. Despite this, the underlying intention is correct. Confidence is 90% due to possible binding syntax nuances.

- **Pass** (100%): Verified that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo.  
  The TodoFocusDirective is provided to automatically focus the input when editing, as evidenced by its implementation.

- **Pass** (85%): Confirmed that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original.  
  The HTML templates reference the TodoMVC CSS files and preserve structural elements such as header and footer. Although the exact visual fidelity depends on proper CSS inclusion and Angular’s rendering, the provided code suggests that it aims to replicate the original appearance. Confidence is 85% as visual appearance can be influenced by external factors not fully shown in the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verified that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately.  
  In both the add and edit functionalities within TodoInputComponent and TodoItemComponent, empty titles are either ignored or trigger deletion, handling empty inputs properly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirmed that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter.  
  The AppRoutingModule defines routes for '/all', '/active', and '/completed', and TodoComponent subscribes to route changes to dispatch filtering actions accordingly.
