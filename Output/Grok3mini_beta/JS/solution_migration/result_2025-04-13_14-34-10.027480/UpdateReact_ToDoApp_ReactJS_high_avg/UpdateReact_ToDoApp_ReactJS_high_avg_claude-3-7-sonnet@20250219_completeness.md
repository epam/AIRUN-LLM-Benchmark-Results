- **Pass** (95%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed

    The answer provides the function for creating new todos when the Enter key is pressed in the `Header.tsx` component. The component includes a `handleKeyDown` function that checks for the Enter key (ENTER_KEY constant), trims the input value, and if valid, dispatches the `addTodo` action to Redux and clears the input field.

    I'm rating this at 95% confidence because while the implementation looks correct, there's no way to verify that it actually works without running the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter

    The answer clearly implements the filtering logic in the `App.tsx` component. It determines the current filter type based on the URL path using `useLocation` from react-router-dom, and then uses `useMemo` to filter the todos accordingly. The filtered todos are passed to the `MainSection` component which in turn renders them through the `TodoList` component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos

    The `MainSection.tsx` component includes an input checkbox with a label "Mark all as complete" that dispatches the `toggleAll` action when clicked. The checkbox state is tied to the `allCompleted` prop, which is computed in the `App.tsx` component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted

    The `TodoItem.tsx` component provides functionality for all these operations:
    - Toggle: Input checkbox that dispatches `toggleTodo` when clicked
    - Edit: Double-click handler that sets the item to editing mode
    - Delete: Button that dispatches `destroyTodo` when clicked

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode

    In the `TodoItem.tsx` component, there's a `handleEdit` function that is called when the label is double-clicked (`onDoubleClick={handleEdit}`). This function sets the `isEditing` state to true and initializes the edit text with the current todo title.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo

    The `TodoItem.tsx` component includes a `handleKeyDown` function that checks for the Enter key (ENTER_KEY constant). When Enter is pressed, it trims the edited text, and if valid, calls the `onSave` prop function which dispatches the `saveTodo` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value

    In the `TodoItem.tsx` component's `handleKeyDown` function, there's a check for the Escape key (ESCAPE_KEY constant). When Escape is pressed, it resets the edit text to the original todo title and sets `isEditing` to false, effectively canceling the edit.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items

    The `Footer.tsx` component receives a `count` prop (representing active todos) and displays it with appropriate pluralization: `<strong>{count}</strong> {activeTodoWord} left`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)

    The `Footer.tsx` component includes navigation links for all three filters using `Link` from react-router-dom. The links point to "/", "/active", and "/completed" respectively, and are styled to show which filter is currently active.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos

    The `Footer.tsx` component includes a "Clear completed" button that only shows when there are completed todos (`{completedCount > 0 && (...)}`) and dispatches the `clearCompleted` action when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence

    The application handles localStorage persistence in two places:
    - In `todosSlice.ts`, it loads the initial state from localStorage using `loadStateFromLocalStorage`
    - In `store.ts`, it subscribes to store changes and saves the todos to localStorage whenever the state changes

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state

    The application conditionally renders UI elements in several places:
    - In `App.tsx`, it only renders
