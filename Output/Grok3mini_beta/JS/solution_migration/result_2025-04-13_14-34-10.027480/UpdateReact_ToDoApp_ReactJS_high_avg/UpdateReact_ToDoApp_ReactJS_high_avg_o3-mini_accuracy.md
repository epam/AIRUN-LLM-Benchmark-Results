# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all React imports use React 18.x compatible syntax  
  All components import React normally and the entry point uses createRoot from 'react-dom/client', which is compatible with React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all components use functional component syntax with hooks instead of class components  
  Every component is implemented as a functional component and hooks (such as useState, useEffect, and useCallback) are used where needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Redux Toolkit's createSlice is used for state management  
  The Redux slice is defined using createSlice in the todosSlice.ts file, meeting this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for all props, state, and Redux store  
  Interfaces like Todo, FilterType, and the props definitions in components and types for the Redux store are properly defined.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses immutable state updates in reducers  
  Although the reducers “mutate” the state directly, Redux Toolkit uses Immer internally to apply immutable state updates correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that nanoid is used for ID generation instead of custom UUID implementation  
  The todosSlice utilizes nanoid for generating new todo IDs.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application uses React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate  
  React.memo is applied in the TodoItem component to prevent unnecessary re-renders when props remain the same.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that useCallback is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders  
  Several event handlers in components such as TodoItem and Header are wrapped in useCallback to optimize performance.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage handling is implemented in a modern way  
  LocalStorage operations in loadStateFromLocalStorage and the store subscription include try-catch error handling for robustness.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows consistent naming conventions throughout the application  
  Naming conventions are consistently applied across files and components (e.g., camelCase for variables and functions).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper error handling is implemented where necessary  
  Error handling is evident in the localStorage functions including try-catch blocks that handle JSON parsing errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware  
  The Redux store is set up using configureStore from Redux Toolkit, which includes sensible default middleware automatically.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that React.lazy is used for code splitting where appropriate  
  Although the documentation mentions React.lazy as a possible enhancement for larger components, it is not implemented in the provided code. For a production-level app requiring dynamic code splitting, the absence of React.lazy is a shortcoming.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the codebase has no TODOs remaining  
  The provided answer explicitly states that all TODO comments and notes have been removed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux Provider wraps the application entry point  
  In index.tsx, the application is correctly wrapped with the Redux Provider (and also BrowserRouter) before rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure strict TypeScript type checking is implemented throughout the application  
  The application's code is written in TypeScript with proper interface definitions and type annotations, indicating strict type checking is enforced.
