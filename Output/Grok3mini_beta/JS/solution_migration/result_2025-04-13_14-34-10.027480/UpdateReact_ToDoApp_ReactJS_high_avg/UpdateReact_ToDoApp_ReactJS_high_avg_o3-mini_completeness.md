# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The Header component listens for the Enter key and dispatches the addTodo action when a non-empty value is provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The App component correctly determines the filter from the URL and passes the filtered list to the MainSection and TodoList components.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  The MainSection component includes a checkbox that dispatches toggleAll, which updates all todos based on its checked state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  The TodoItem component provides onToggle, onSave, and onDestroy handlers that are correctly wired to the Redux actions for toggling, editing, and deleting todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  In TodoItem, a double-click event on the label calls handleEdit, which switches the component into editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  The onKeyDown handler in TodoItem checks for the Enter key and, if the edited text is valid, dispatches the onSave action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  The onKeyDown handler in TodoItem handles the Escape key by resetting the editText to the original todo title and exiting editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  The Footer component receives the active count as a prop and correctly displays it using the pluralize function.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The Footer component uses react-router-dom Links for navigating between "All", "Active", and "Completed" filters.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  The Footer renders a "Clear completed" button when there are completed todos, which triggers the onClearCompleted handler.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  The Redux store is configured to subscribe to state changes and persist the todos to localStorage with error handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  The App component conditionally renders the MainSection and Footer based on the todo list length and state of active/completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  The Footer uses the pluralize utility function to correctly determine whether to display "item" or "items" based on the active todo count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The application is split into focused components such as Header, MainSection, TodoList, TodoItem, and Footer, adhering to modular React design.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The provided file structure organizes components, state management, types, and utilities into separate files by feature, ensuring clarity and maintainability.
