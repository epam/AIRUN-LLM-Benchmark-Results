# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration  
  The entry point uses ReactDOM.createRoot (a React 18 feature) and the project structure aligns with Create React App configured for TypeScript.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure  
  The code defines a Note type and uses a Record<Note, HTMLAudioElement> for the soundMapper, ensuring TypeScript’s type safety.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks  
  Every component (App, Header, Footer, ButtonContainer, Piano, PianoKey, FullscreenButton) is implemented as a functional component, with hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useCallback in use.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)  
  useState is used for managing active notes and view mode, and useEffect manages keyboard events, demonstrating proper state and lifecycle handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels  
  The App component attaches document-level keydown and keyup event listeners using useEffect, which is a proper placement for application-wide keyboard handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events  
  The Piano component attaches onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseOut, and onMouseMove event handlers to handle user interactions via React’s synthetic events.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment  
  Audio files are instantiated as HTMLAudioElement objects in the soundMapper, and playback is managed through playNote and resetNote functions with currentTime resets and error handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility  
  The FullscreenButton component uses the Fullscreen API with proper error handling and conditional checks, aligning with React practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns  
  Conditional CSS classes are applied using template literals in both ButtonContainer and PianoKey components based on the current state and props.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate  
  While the code uses useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-creations of functions, it does not leverage React.memo (or similar memoization techniques) to optimize re-rendering of static components (e.g., Header, Footer, and PianoKey). Implementing React.memo for such components could further improve performance.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations  
  The audio playback is initiated and reset with proper state updates and useCallback is used to memoize event handlers for consistency during the component lifecycle.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application  
  The code strictly types components, props, states, and the audio mapping, ensuring adherence to TypeScript best practices.
