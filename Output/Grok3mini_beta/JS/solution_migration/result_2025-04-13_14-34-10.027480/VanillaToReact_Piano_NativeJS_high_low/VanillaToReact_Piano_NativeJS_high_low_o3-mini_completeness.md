# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title "Virtual Piano"  
  The Header component clearly renders an h1 element with the text "Virtual Piano".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with "Notes" and "Letters" toggle buttons  
  The ButtonContainer component provides two buttons labeled "Notes" and "Letters" which conditionally apply the active class based on the view mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)  
  The Piano component constructs two arrays—one for white (natural) keys and one for black (sharp) keys—with the correct number of keys, including a placeholder key where applicable.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes  
  The PianoKey component assigns data-letter and data-note attributes to each key, ensuring proper identification.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked  
  The playNote function in App.tsx references a soundMapper object that correctly maps notes to audio files. The click (mouse down) events on piano keys trigger playNote as intended.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)  
  Active piano keys are conditionally given the "piano-key-active" class based on the activeNotes state, ensuring visual feedback when pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes  
  The useEffect hook in App.tsx adds the necessary keyboard event listeners (keydown and keyup) that trigger playNote and resetNote based on the mapping in letterToNote.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked  
  The state management with viewMode, along with conditional classNames in both ButtonContainer and Piano components, confirms that toggling between "notes" and "letters" works as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes  
  The FullscreenButton component handles the fullscreen API correctly by toggling fullscreen mode upon clicking.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly  
  The implementation of activeNotes as an array and the event handlers ensure that multiple keys can be processed simultaneously without interference.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys  
  The Piano component's event handlers (onMouseMove with a check for left mouse button pressed) allow for continuous audio playback and proper state changes during mouse dragging.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information  
  The Footer component renders a footer with the year "2020" as specified.
