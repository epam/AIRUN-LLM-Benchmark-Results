# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18.x
  
  The code explicitly uses React 18.x features like the new `ReactDOM.createRoot` API in `src/index.tsx`:
  ```tsx
  import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement);
  ```
  This is a clear indicator of React 18 usage, as this API was introduced in React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript for type safety
  
  The code consistently uses TypeScript throughout all files with `.tsx` extensions and type annotations. For example, interfaces are defined for todos and state, and TypeScript types are used for props, state, and Redux store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for state management
  
  The implementation properly uses Redux Toolkit with `createSlice` in the `todosSlice.ts` file:
  ```tsx
  import { createSlice, PayloadAction } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
  const todosSlice = createSlice({
    name: 'todos',
    initialState: {
      todos: [],
      filter: 'all',
    } as TodosState,
    reducers: { /* ... */ }
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm nanoid is used for generating unique IDs
  
  The code imports and uses `nanoid` for generating unique IDs for new todos:
  ```tsx
  import { nanoid } from 'nanoid';
  // ...
  prepare: (title: string) => {
    return {
      payload: {
        id: nanoid(),
        title,
        completed: false,
      },
    };
  },
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code uses functional components with hooks instead of class components
  
  All components are implemented as functional components using hooks. For example:
  - `useState` in `Header.tsx` and `TodoItem.tsx`
  - `useEffect` in `TodoContainer.tsx` and `TodoItem.tsx`
  - `useRef` in `TodoItem.tsx`
  - Custom hooks like `useAppDispatch` and Redux hooks like `useSelector`

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains the same routing functionality with proper route handling
  
  The application uses `HashRouter` from React Router to maintain the original hash-based routing:
  ```tsx
  <HashRouter basename="/">
    <Routes>
      <Route path=":filter" element={<TodoContainer />} />
      <Route path="/" element={<Navigate to="/all" replace />} />
    </Routes>
  </HashRouter>
  ```
  It handles all required routes (`/all`, `/active`, `/completed`) and includes a redirect from the root path to `/all`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Redux store is properly configured with appropriate slices
  
  The Redux store is properly configured in `store.ts` with the todos reducer and includes persistence logic:
  ```tsx
  const store = configureStore({
    reducer: {
      todos: todosReducer,
    },
    preloadedState: {
      todos: { ...todosReducer.getInitialState(), todos: persistedTodos } as TodosState,
    },
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the Redux provider is set up in the application entry point
  
  The Redux provider is correctly set up in `index.tsx`:
  ```tsx
  root.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
      <Provider store={store}>
        <App />
      </Provider>
    </React.StrictMode>
  );
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for all data structures
  
  The code defines proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures:
  ```tsx
  // For todos
  export interface Todo {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    completed: boolean;
  }
  
  // For state
  export interface TodosState {
    todos: Todo[];
    filter: 'all' | 'active' | 'completed';
