# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos
  
  The application includes a Header component with an h1 title "todos" and an input field with className "new-todo" that allows creating new todos. The input has proper placeholder text and handles Enter key press to add a new todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos
  
  The MainSection component includes an input with id "toggle-all" and className "toggle-all" for toggling all todos, along with a ul element with className "todo-list" that renders TodoItem components for each todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button
  
  The TodoItem component includes a toggle checkbox (input with className "toggle"), a label for displaying the todo title, and a delete button (button with className "destroy").

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode
  
  The TodoItem component has a double-click handler on the label element (onDoubleClick={handleDoubleClick}) that sets the editing state to true, causing the edit input field to be displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The application uses React Router with routes for different filters. The Footer component includes Links to "/all", "/active", and "/completed", and the selectFilteredTodos selector filters todos based on the current filter state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization
  
  The Footer component displays the active count with proper pluralization: `<strong>{activeCount}</strong> {activeCount === 1 ? 'item' : 'items'} left`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter
  
  The Footer component includes Link components with a "selected" className conditionally applied based on the current filter state: `className={filter === 'all' ? 'selected' : ''}`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist
  
  The Footer component conditionally renders a "Clear completed" button when completedCount > 0: `{completedCount > 0 && (<button className="clear-completed" onClick={() => dispatch(clearCompleted())}>Clear completed</button>)}`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter
  
  The Header component has an input field that handles the Enter key press to add a new todo and clears the input field afterward: `handleKeyDown` function checks for the Enter key and dispatches the addTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos
  
  The TodoItem component includes a toggle checkbox that dispatches the toggleTodo action when changed: `onChange={handleToggle}`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once
  
  The MainSection component includes a toggle-all checkbox that dispatches the toggleAll action when changed: `onChange={(e) => dispatch(toggleAll(e.target.checked))}`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management
  
  The TodoItem component includes an edit input that is conditionally rendered when isEditing is true. It uses useRef and useEffect to focus the input when it appears: `useEffect(() => { if (isEditing) { editInputRef.current?.focus(); }}, [isEditing])`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos
  
  The TodoItem component includes a destroy button that dispatches the deleteTodo action when clicked: `onClick={handleDestroy}`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos
  
  The Footer component includes a "Clear completed" button that dispatches the clearCompleted action when clicked: `onClick={() => dispatch(clearCompleted())}`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status
  
  The selectFilteredTodos selector filters todos based on the current filter state, returning all todos, only active todos, or only completed todos depending on the filter.
