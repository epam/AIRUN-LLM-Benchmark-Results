# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18.x  
  The use of ReactDOM.createRoot in the entry file (src/index.tsx) confirms the app targets React 18.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript for type safety  
  All source files have .ts or .tsx extensions; interfaces and types are declared, ensuring type safety.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for state management  
  The code leverages Redux Toolkitâ€™s createSlice (in src/todosSlice.ts) for managing todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm nanoid is used for generating unique IDs  
  The todosSlice uses nanoid from the 'nanoid' package to generate unique IDs for todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code uses functional components with hooks instead of class components  
  All components are defined as function components, using hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useSelector.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains the same routing functionality with proper route handling  
  The migration uses React Router's HashRouter to retain hash-based routing and includes a redirect from the root to "/all".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Redux store is properly configured with appropriate slices  
  The store (src/store.ts) is configured using configureStore, and it integrates the todosSlice correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the Redux provider is set up in the application entry point  
  The Redux Provider wraps the App component in src/index.tsx, ensuring that the store is accessible throughout the app.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for all data structures  
  Interfaces such as Todo and TodosState are defined in the todosSlice, and types are used across components and store configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows React best practices for component composition  
  The components are well-modularized, functional, and use hooks and memoization (via reselect selectors), aligning with best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles keyboard events properly (Enter key for creating/updating todos, Escape key for canceling edits)  
  Keyboard event handlers are implemented in Header (for adding todos) and in TodoItem (for handling Enter and Escape during editing).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application maintains local storage persistence if implemented  
  The Redux store subscribes to changes and writes the todos array to local storage, ensuring persistence across sessions.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  While the provided code appears clean and adheres to common best practices, it has not been executed in a live environment for runtime verification. Minor issues or warnings might emerge during integration testing.  
  Explanation: Confidence is 90% based on code review rather than runtime testing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application implements proper error handling  
  The application handles invalid routes by redirecting to "/all" and safely processes Redux actions. While error handling is minimal, it sufficiently covers expected user interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code is optimized with no unnecessary re-renders  
  The use of React hooks, memoized selectors (via createSelector), and conditional rendering (e.g., hiding sections when there are no todos) indicates the application is optimized to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
