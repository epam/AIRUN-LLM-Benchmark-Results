- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode  
  The TodoItem component listens for a double-click event on the label to activate editing mode (setting <code>isEditing</code> to <code>true</code>), thus passing this verification.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The Footer component provides links for "All", "Active", and "Completed" filtering, and the route setup in App along with the use of <code>setFilter</code> in TodoContainer ensures filtering functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization
