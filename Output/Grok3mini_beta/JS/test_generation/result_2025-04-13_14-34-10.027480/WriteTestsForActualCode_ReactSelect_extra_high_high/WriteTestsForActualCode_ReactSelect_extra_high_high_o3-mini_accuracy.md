# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up in the test file  
  The test file correctly imports React, Jest methods, and React Testing Library utilities, indicating a proper setup.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test cases are properly isolated and do not have interdependencies  
  Each test uses fresh renders via the factory function (renderSelect) and there are no shared states between tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that DOM events are simulated using proper React Testing Library methods  
  The tests employ userEvent for simulating keyboard and mouse interactions, and fireEvent is appropriately used for touch events.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that accessibility attributes are being tested appropriately  
  ARIA roles, attributes (like aria-expanded, aria-haspopup), and live region updates are thoroughly checked in the accessibility test section.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure mocks are used for external dependencies where appropriate  
  External dependencies such as the "isAppleDevice" helper are appropriately mocked, and callback props are substituted with jest.fn().

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of async/await for asynchronous testing where needed  
  The code uses async/await with userEvent and waitFor where asynchronous interactions occur, ensuring correct handling of async test flows.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all assertions use appropriate Jest matchers  
  Assertions are implemented using matchers like toBeInTheDocument, toHaveAttribute, and toBeDisabled, confirming the use of correct Jest matchers.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that tests include proper cleanup after each test case  
  Although there is no explicit cleanup call, React Testing Library's auto-cleanup feature is assumed to be enabled. If not explicitly configured in the environment, this could be a potential concern.  
  Explanation: Confidence is slightly reduced (90%) due to reliance on auto-cleanup without explicit teardown instructions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test descriptions clearly indicate what functionality is being tested  
  The test case names and describe block headings are descriptive and clearly convey the intent of each test.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the test file follows best practices for organizing test cases (describe/it blocks)  
  The tests are well-organized into logical describe blocks, grouping related tests appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that all event handlers are tested using appropriate simulation methods  
  All event handlers are effectively simulated using userEvent (for keyboard and mouse) and fireEvent (for touch), validating correct handler testing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the test environment correctly simulates both mouse and keyboard interactions  
  The test suite includes separate tests for mouse events (clicks), keyboard events (arrow keys, enter, escape), and these are effectively simulated using corresponding methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for touch events properly simulate mobile interactions  
  Touch interactions are simulated using fireEvent with touchStart and touchEnd events, adequately mimicking mobile touch behavior.
