# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist  
  The "Rendering Tests" section includes multiple tests that confirm the component renders correctly with default props.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present  
  The "User Interaction Tests" include tests for arrow key navigation, Enter, and Escape keys. Additionally, focus management is tested using tab interactions.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)  
  While the tests verify clicking behavior through multiple scenarios (opening the menu and selecting options), there is no explicit test for hovering interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior  
  Separate tests for controlled behavior (using the value prop and onChange) and uncontrolled behavior (state changes via user interactions) are present.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values  
  Tests include selecting an option, checking the displayed value, and clearing the selection using the clear indicator.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented  
  A dedicated test verifies that the menu opens on click and closes on a repeated click, as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality  
  There is a test that types into the input and confirms that the options are filtered as per the input used.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist  
  Tests for multi-select behavior are present and demonstrate that multiple options can be selected and rendered.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility  
  The accessibility tests cover ARIA attributes (such as aria-expanded, aria-haspopup, and role) and include checks for live region usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested  
  There is a test to verify that when no options are provided, a "No options available" message is shown.

- **Fail** (95%): Validate tests for loading and error states  
  While there is a test confirming the loading state ("handles loading state correctly"), there are no explicit tests addressing error states. This leaves error handling unverified.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states  
  A test exists that confirms disabled options (and components) are handled correctly by checking for the proper aria-disabled attribute.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance  
  There is a dedicated performance test that renders a large number of options (1000 options) and verifies that the component renders without crashing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested  
  Focus management is verified through tests that simulate tab interactions and arrow key navigation to ensure proper focus transitions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering  
  The tests confirm that custom placeholders are rendered and that the correct value is displayed upon selection.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations  
  There are no tests explicitly verifying the behavior of custom formatOptionLabel implementations, which is a gap in the test coverage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)  
  The tests include verification that these callback functions are invoked appropriately in response to user interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)  
  The tests check for the presence and functionality of indicator components like the clear indicator and loading message, confirming their proper behavior.
