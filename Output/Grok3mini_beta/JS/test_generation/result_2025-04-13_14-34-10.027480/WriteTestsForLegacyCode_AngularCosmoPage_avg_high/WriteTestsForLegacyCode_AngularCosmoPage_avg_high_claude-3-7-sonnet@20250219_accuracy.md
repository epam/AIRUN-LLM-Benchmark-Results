# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)
  
  The tests are using Jasmine as the testing framework and Karma as the test runner, which are appropriate choices for AngularJS applications. This is clearly stated in the code and configuration provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints
  
  The tests properly inject and check for $resource objects in the REST factory tests. The code includes appropriate verification that REST API resources are properly instantiated and defined.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation
  
  The tests consistently use beforeEach hooks to set up the testing environment, including module loading, dependency injection, and test-specific mocks. An afterEach hook is also used to verify that no HTTP expectations remain outstanding.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls
  
  The tests use $httpBackend to mock HTTP requests rather than making real API calls. The implementation includes proper expectations for HTTP methods, URLs, and responses, and flushes the backend to simulate completing the requests.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection
  
  The tests correctly use AngularJS's dependency injection system, injecting services like REST, $location, $rootScope, etc. using the _ServiceName_ pattern, which is the standard approach in AngularJS testing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations
  
  Asynchronous operations are properly handled using $httpBackend.flush() to resolve promises, and the code uses $scope.$apply() when necessary to trigger digest cycles that resolve promises in the tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies
  
  The tests make appropriate use of Jasmine spies for functions like $location.path, $rootScope.$broadcast, localStorage methods, and $translate.instant, allowing verification of how these dependencies are used without affecting real behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization
  
  All tests use the describe/it pattern consistently, with descriptive blocks that indicate what components are being tested and individual test cases that specify expected behaviors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls
  
  The tests include both successful API calls (200 responses) and error scenarios (500 responses), verifying that error handling works as expected, such as showing error notifications.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate
  
  The tests properly simulate user interactions by directly calling controller methods that would be triggered by user actions, such as titleChange(), deletePage(), and savePage(), and then verifying the expected outcomes.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage
  
  The tests include proper cleanup through the afterEach hook that verifies no outstanding HTTP expectations or requests remain, and the use of isolated scopes with $scope = $rootScope.$new() prevents state leakage between tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested
  
  The test descriptions are clear and descriptive, explaining what functionality is being tested in each case (e.g., "should delete the page and related resources on success", "should auto-generate URL when autoURL is true").

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible
  
  The tests focus on validating function outputs and side effects (like DOM changes, notifications, redirects) rather than implementation details. For example, they verify that deletePage() results in the expected API calls and notifications rather than checking internal variables.
