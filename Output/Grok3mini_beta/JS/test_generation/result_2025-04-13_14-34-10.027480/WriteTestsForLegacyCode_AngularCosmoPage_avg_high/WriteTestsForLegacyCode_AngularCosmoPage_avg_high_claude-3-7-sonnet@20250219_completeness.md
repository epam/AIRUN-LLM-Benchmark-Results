# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly
- **Pass** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller
- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)
- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions
- **Pass** (90%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components

    While comprehensive test cases are provided that should achieve good coverage, the actual coverage percentage cannot be definitively confirmed without running the tests with a coverage tool. The test suite is well-structured to cover most code paths, but the 80% threshold is an estimate based on the test cases provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling
- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality
