# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)  
  The provided tests consistently use Jasmine for structuring test suites (describe/it) and Karma for running tests in the browser.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints  
  The tests check that REST endpoints are instances of $resource and use $httpBackend to simulate API calls, ensuring proper handling of REST endpoints.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation  
  All test files make ample use of beforeEach to set up the test environment, and afterEach (especially in the controller tests) to verify that HTTP calls are flushed, thereby ensuring isolation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls  
  The tests employ $httpBackend to expect and flush HTTP requests, preventing any real API calls during test execution.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection  
  Each test suite uses AngularJS’s module and inject functions to load the module and required dependencies such as REST, $controller, and others.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations  
  Asynchronous operations (like HTTP calls) are correctly handled using $httpBackend.flush(). However, explicit testing of promise rejections or resolutions isn’t extensively shown, which is why the confidence is slightly reduced.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies  
  The tests make effective use of spies (e.g., on localStorage, $translate, $location, and $rootScope.$broadcast) to replace and monitor external dependency behaviors.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization  
  Every specified test file employs a clear hierarchical structure using describe for grouping and it for individual assertions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls  
  There are explicit tests that not only validate successful HTTP responses but also simulate failure cases (e.g., API error responses in deletePage and savePage).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate  
  The tests simulate user interactions such as input changes (title, description) and trigger functions like titleChange and descriptionChange to verify UI behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage  
  The use of afterEach to verify that there are no outstanding HTTP expectations/requests and reinitializing state in each beforeEach guarantees that tests do not leak state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested  
  Test descriptions are clear and self-explanatory (e.g., “should initialize with default values”, “should handle error in deletePage”), making the purpose of each test explicit.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible  
  The tests focus on observable output such as changes in Page properties, broadcasted notifications, or redirection paths, rather than relying on internal implementation details.
