# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation includes a comprehensive component overview explaining the purpose and architecture  
  The documentation provides both an "Architecture Overview" and a "Component Overview" that clearly explain the purpose, structure, and high-level design of the module.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all major components (REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and Page controller) are documented  
  Each of these major components is documented with tables and descriptive details about their properties, methods, and dependencies.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure all significant features of the page management system are described  
  The documentation includes detailed descriptions of features such as page creation/editing, URL auto-generation, tag autocompletion, scheduling, revision management, duplication, and deletion.

- **Pass** (90%): Check that all form inputs and their behavior are documented  
  Although the documentation discusses user interface elements (e.g., use of AngularJS directives like ng-model, ng-click) and mentions input fields in the context of various features, it does not comprehensively list every form input element and its behavior. The general handling is described, but additional explicit mapping of every form field could improve clarity.  
  Explanation: Because while the general behavior is documented, an item-by-item documentation of all inputs is not fully detailed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page versioning and revision system  
  The revision system and the associated extras management are clearly documented under the "Revision and Extras Management" section.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation covers the tag system and autocomplete functionality  
  The documentation provides thorough details on tag autocompletion, including technical implementation using AngularJS directives and REST calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes explanation of error handling and user notifications  
  Error handling is addressed via promise callbacks and event broadcasting (e.g., via $rootScope.$broadcast('notify', ...)), clearly explaining the notifications sent during error conditions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page publishing workflow including scheduling  
  The publication scheduling and workflow for page publishing are well explained, including the use of date pickers, status toggling, and Unix timestamp management.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation details how content extras and additional metadata are managed  
  Content extras and metadata are detailed in the "Revision and Extras Management" section, along with their serialization and handling flows.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation explains how the UI interacts with the backend APIs  
  The interactions with backend APIs are described throughout, especially in the REST factory and in the discussion of data flow and API calls from the controller.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes sample usage examples or patterns  
  A sample code snippet is provided showing how to include the module in an AngularJS application with examples of routing configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains all significant event broadcasting and inter-component communication  
  The documentation explains the events (such as contentGet, settingsGet, and notify) broadcast to communicate between different components, elucidating inter-component interactions.
