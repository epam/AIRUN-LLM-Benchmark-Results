# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x
  
  The component uses React hooks like useState, useRef, and useEffect, which are compatible with React 18.x. The import statement `import React, { useState, useRef, useEffect } from 'react';` confirms it's using React.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
  
  The code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions including interfaces for `Option` and `SelectProps`. The component is defined as `React.FC<SelectProps>` and there are appropriate type annotations throughout the code (like `ref={buttonRef}` with `const buttonRef = useRef<HTMLButtonElement>(null)`).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling
  
  The component imports a CSS file with `import './index.css';` and the CSS content is provided in a separate code block labeled `/* src/index.css */`.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments
  
  The code is clean and well-structured without any TODO comments or debug statements.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility
  
  The component uses multiple state hooks appropriately:
  - `useState` for dropdown visibility (`isOpen`)
  - `useState` for internal selected value (`internalSelected`)
  - `useState` for search term (`searchTerm`)
  - `useState` for highlighted index (`highlightedIndex`)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props
  
  The component accepts several props for customization:
  - `options`: Array of selectable options
  - `value`: Optional controlled value
  - `onChange`: Optional callback for value changes
  - `placeholder`: Optional placeholder text (with default)
  - `className`: Optional CSS class name (with default)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection
  
  The component implements comprehensive keyboard navigation:
  - Arrow keys for navigating options
  - Enter for selecting options
  - Escape for closing the dropdown
  - Space/Enter for toggling the dropdown

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions
  
  The component follows best practices using refs:
  - Uses `useRef` for DOM references
  - Properly initializes refs with null
  - Uses optional chaining when accessing ref current values
  - Uses refs to manage focus appropriately

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques
  
  The component manages focus correctly:
  - Focuses the search input when dropdown opens
  - Returns focus to the button when dropdown closes
  - Implements click outside and focus outside handlers to close the dropdown

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
  
  The component uses several ARIA attributes:
  - `aria-expanded` for dropdown state
  - `aria-haspopup` and `aria-controls` for popup relationship
  - `aria-autocomplete`, `aria-controls`, and `aria-activedescendant` for input
  - `role="combobox"`, `role="listbox"`, and `role="option"` for semantic structure
  - `aria-selected` for selected option state

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  The code doesn't contain any console.log, console.error, or similar statements that would produce console output.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component
  
  The component efficiently manages renders by:
  - Using proper dependencies in useEffect hooks
  - Computing derived state (like selectedOption and filteredOptions) during render instead of storing in state
  - Correctly handling controlled vs. uncontrolled state
