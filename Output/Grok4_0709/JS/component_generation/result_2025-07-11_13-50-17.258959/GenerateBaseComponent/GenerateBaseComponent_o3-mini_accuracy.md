# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  Although the code does not explicitly state the React version, it uses React hooks and functional components in a style that is wholly consistent with React 18.x. The use of modern React features indicates compatibility with React 18.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  The code defines TypeScript interfaces (Option and SelectProps) and makes proper use of type annotations (e.g., useRef<HTMLButtonElement>, useState<string | null>) throughout the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  An external CSS file ("./index.css") is imported and its contents are provided, demonstrating that the styling is managed in a separate file.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  The component code is clean with no commented-out TODOs or unfinished code blocks. The code is well-organized and free from extraneous comments.

- **Pass** (95%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  The component maintains state for dropdown visibility (isOpen), the selected item (internalSelected), the search term, and the highlighted index using useState. It also supports controlled and uncontrolled modes for the selected value.  
  (Slight caution: while the state management meets the requirements, additional memoization or optimization could further enhance performance in complex applications.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  The component accepts props such as options, value, onChange, placeholder, and className, making it flexible and customizable for various use cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  The provided keyboard handlers manage Enter, Space, Escape, ArrowUp, and ArrowDown key events, enabling full keyboard navigation and selection within the dropdown.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  The code uses useRef appropriately for handling focus on the button, dropdown, and search input. It also adds and cleans up event listeners for click and focus events.  
  (Minor note: Although the current approach is sound, using useCallback for event handler functions could sometimes help prevent unnecessary re-renders in more complex scenarios.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  Focus is managed by shifting focus to the search input when the dropdown opens and reverting focus to the button when it closes, ensuring a smooth user experience.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  ARIA attributes such as aria-expanded, aria-haspopup, aria-controls, aria-activedescendant, and appropriate roles (e.g., combobox, listbox, option) are correctly applied to enhance accessibility.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  Based on the provided code inspection, there are no apparent issues that would trigger console errors or warnings.  
  (Note: Without executing the code in a live environment, absolute certainty is limited, but the static analysis shows no red flags.)

- **Pass** (85%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  The component is structured to handle state updates and event listeners appropriately.  
  (However, since some event handler functions are re-created on every render and no memoization is applied, there is a minor possibility of unnecessary re-renders in a high-frequency update context. For the current use case, this design is acceptable.)
