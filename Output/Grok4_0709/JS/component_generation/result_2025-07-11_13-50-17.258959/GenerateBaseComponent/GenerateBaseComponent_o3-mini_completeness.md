# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component returns a button and conditionally renders a dropdown (a div with the class "dropdown") that contains the select options.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  The code clearly renders an input element (with role "combobox" and class "search-input") inside the dropdown for searching options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The logic in the component handles selection via a single state variable (either internal state or a provided value) and calls a selectOption function to update the selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The key down handler (handleSearchKeyDown) processes "ArrowDown" and "ArrowUp" to update the highlightedIndex, allowing keyboard navigation through the options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  In the search input key down handler, pressing "Enter" when an option is highlighted calls selectOption for that option, enabling selection via the keyboard.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  The button's key down handler (handleButtonKeyDown) listens for the "Enter" (or space) key to toggle the dropdown's open state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  An effect is used such that when isOpen becomes false, focus is set back to the button (buttonRef.current?.focus()), ensuring the select component regains focus.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  The onClick handler for each option calls selectOption, which in turn calls setIsOpen(false), closing the dropdown after a mouse click.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  Similar to the mouse click scenario, selecting an item with the Enter key triggers selectOption, which closes the dropdown by setting isOpen to false.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  Both the button and search input key handlers include logic to close the dropdown (setIsOpen(false)) when the Escape key is detected.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  A useEffect hook adds an event listener to the document that checks if a click occurs outside the dropdown and button, closing the dropdown if so.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  The button's onKeyDown handler toggles the dropdown open state on pressing the Enter key when the button (i.e., the component) is focused.
