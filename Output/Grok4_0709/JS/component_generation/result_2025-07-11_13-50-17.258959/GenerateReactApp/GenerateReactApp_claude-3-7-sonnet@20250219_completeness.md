# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The application clearly fetches character data from the SWAPI endpoint (`https://swapi.dev/api/people`) and renders the characters in a list format with their names.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The application shows a "Loading characters..." message when the `loading` state is true, which is set during the API call.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The code maps through all the characters in the `characters` state array and renders each one in a list item, ensuring all fetched characters are displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  The application is simple and focused on displaying the character list only. There are no search fields, filters, or other user input elements included in the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character is rendered in a list item showing the character's name property: `<li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The structure matches a Create React App with TypeScript template, including the package.json configuration, folder structure, and file setup. The instructions also explicitly mention using `npx create-react-app swapi-app --template typescript`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The application implements three state variables with useState:
  - `characters`: Stores the fetched character data
  - `loading`: Tracks the loading state during API calls
  - `error`: Captures any errors that occur during fetching

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each list item uses the character's URL as a unique key: `<li key={character.url}>`, which is appropriate since the URLs in the SWAPI are unique identifiers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  The application handles three states properly:
  - Loading state: Shows a loading message
  - Error state: Displays the error message
  - Success with data: Renders the character list
  
  If the API returns an empty array, the map function would not produce any list items, effectively showing an empty list, which is appropriate behavior.
