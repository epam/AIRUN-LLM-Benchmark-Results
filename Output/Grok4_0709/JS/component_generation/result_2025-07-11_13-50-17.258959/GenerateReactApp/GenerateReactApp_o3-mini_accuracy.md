# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses React 18.x or newer by checking the package.json dependencies  
  The package.json lists "react": "^18.3.1", which confirms that React 18.x (or newer) is being used.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that TypeScript is properly implemented with appropriate type definitions for all components, props, and states  
  The code is written in TypeScript (with .tsx and .ts files) and defines interfaces for characters and the API response. It makes proper use of TypeScript with typed hooks (e.g., useState<boolean>, useState<Character[]>). 

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Axios is used for API requests to fetch data from the Star Wars API endpoint  
  Axios is imported and used to make a GET request to "https://swapi.dev/api/people", confirming its usage for API communication.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles API errors gracefully with appropriate error states or messages  
  The fetch function includes a try-catch block specifically catching Axios errors, setting an error message accordingly, and there is a conditional rendering to display the error message if an error occurs.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the character data is fetched on component mount using useEffect hook  
  The useEffect hook is correctly used with an empty dependency array to ensure that the fetch request is executed only onceâ€”at component mount.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application properly manages component rendering optimization  
  The application leverages React hooks efficiently by fetching data only once during mount and using state to avoid unnecessary renders. Each character is rendered with a unique key based on their URL, supporting React's reconciliation process.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows React best practices using hooks appropriately  
  The code utilizes useEffect for side effects and useState for managing local component state. The overall structure and dependency setup follow best practices for React functional components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't contain any TODO comments or unnecessary code  
  The code is clean with only necessary comments and includes no TODO notes or extraneous code segments.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the codebase has minimal comments that only clarify complex logic when necessary  
  Comments are used sparingly and effectively to describe key functionalities (e.g., describing data fetching and TypeScript interfaces) without cluttering the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the API endpoint 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' is being called correctly  
  The Axios GET request explicitly calls "https://swapi.dev/api/people", verifying that the correct API endpoint is used.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application renders without console errors or warnings  
  Based on the provided code structure and adherence to best practices, the application is expected to render cleanly. No obvious mistakes suggest that there will be console errors or warnings during runtime.
