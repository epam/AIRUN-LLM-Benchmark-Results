# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The code successfully fetches characters from the SWAPI endpoint and maps over the results to display each character's name.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  When the request is in progress, a "Loading characters..." message is displayed, confirming the presence of a loading indicator.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  All characters from the API response (contained in response.data.results) are rendered in an unordered list.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  The provided code does not implement any search features or input fields, adhering to the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each list item displays the character's name and uses the unique URL as the key, ensuring proper presentation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The instructions and file structure (e.g., package.json, src/index.tsx, src/App.tsx) indicate that the project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The application uses React hooks (useState and useEffect) to manage states for loading, error, and character data effectively.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  Unique keys are provided for each list item (using character.url), which is the recommended approach in React for optimal rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  In case the API returns an empty array, the application gracefully shows an empty list without errors. Although a dedicated empty-state message could enhance the UX, the current behavior does not cause any failure.
