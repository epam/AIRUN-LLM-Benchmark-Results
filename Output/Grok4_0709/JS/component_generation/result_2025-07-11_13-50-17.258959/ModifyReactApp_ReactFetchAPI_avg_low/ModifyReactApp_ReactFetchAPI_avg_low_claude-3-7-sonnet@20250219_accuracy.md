# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type
  
  The input field correctly updates state with `onChange={(e) => setSearchTerm(e.target.value)}` which updates the `searchTerm` state variable.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls
  
  The code implements debouncing with a 500ms delay using setTimeout:
  ```tsx
  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      setDebouncedSearchTerm(searchTerm);
    }, 500);
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }, [searchTerm]);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured
  
  Axios is imported and used for API requests with proper configuration:
  ```tsx
  const response: AxiosResponse<PeopleResponse> = await axios.get(
    `https://swapi.dev/api/people/?search=${debouncedSearchTerm}`
  );
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses
  
  The code includes TypeScript interfaces for `Character` and `PeopleResponse`, and types for all state variables and components:
  ```tsx
  interface Character { name: string; url: string; }
  interface PeopleResponse { ... }
  const [characters, setCharacters] = useState<Character[]>([]);
  const CharacterList: React.FC = () => { ... }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters
  
  The API endpoint correctly includes the search parameter:
  ```tsx
  `https://swapi.dev/api/people/?search=${debouncedSearchTerm}`
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate
  
  The code uses both `useMemo` for rendering the character list and `useCallback` for the fetch function:
  ```tsx
  const fetchCharacters = useCallback(async () => { ... }, [debouncedSearchTerm]);
  const characterList = useMemo(() => { ... }, [characters]);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback
  
  Error handling is implemented with try/catch and appropriate user feedback:
  ```tsx
  try {
    // API request
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch characters:', err);
    setError('Failed to load characters. Please try again later.');
  }
  ```
  The UI also conditionally renders error messages: `{error ? <div style={{ color: 'red' }}>{error}</div> : ...}`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing
  
  API calls are triggered by changes to `debouncedSearchTerm`, which only updates after the debounce timer completes:
  ```tsx
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchCharacters();
  }, [fetchCharacters]);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices
  
  The code follows React best practices with separate state variables for different concerns and appropriate update patterns:
  ```tsx
  const [characters, setCharacters] = useState<Character[]>([]);
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState<string>('');
  const [debouncedSearchTerm, setDebouncedSearchTerm] = useState<string>('');
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code
  
  The code appears clean without unused imports or commented-out code. There is a `console.error` used appropriately for error logging.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests
  
  Loading state is properly managed with `setLoading(true)` before the request and `setLoading(false)` in the finally block:
  ```tsx
  setLoading(true);
  try {
    // API request
  } catch (err) {
    // Error handling
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);
  }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns
  
  The component uses modern React patterns compatible with React 18.x, including functional components, hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo), and proper error boundaries.
