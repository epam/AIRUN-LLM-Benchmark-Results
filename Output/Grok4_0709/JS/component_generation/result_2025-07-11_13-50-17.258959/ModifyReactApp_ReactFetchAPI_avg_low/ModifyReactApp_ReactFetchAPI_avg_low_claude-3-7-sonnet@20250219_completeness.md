# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name
    
    The component includes an input field with a placeholder "Search characters..." that updates the searchTerm state and triggers filtering through the API.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests
    
    The code properly sets a loading state before API requests and shows a "Loading..." message when loading is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query
    
    Initial data loading is implemented through a useEffect hook that calls fetchCharacters when the component mounts, with an empty debouncedSearchTerm initially.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type
    
    The code implements debouncing (with a 500ms delay) to update search results as users type without excessive API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found
    
    When the characters array is empty, the component displays "No characters found."

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design
    
    The component uses relative sizing (maxWidth: '600px', width: '100%') and proper box-sizing, indicating responsive design principles. However, there's no explicit media queries for different screen sizes, which is why I'm 90% confident.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response
    
    After the API response, the characters state is updated with response.data.results and displayed as a list using map to create list items.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed
    
    The component is wrapped in an ErrorBoundary class component that catches errors and displays a fallback UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props
    
    The code defines interfaces for Character, PeopleResponse, and proper typing for the ErrorBoundary component. All state variables are properly typed with TypeScript generics.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities
    
    The code maintains a complete character listing functionality while adding search capabilities through the SWAPI API's search parameter.
