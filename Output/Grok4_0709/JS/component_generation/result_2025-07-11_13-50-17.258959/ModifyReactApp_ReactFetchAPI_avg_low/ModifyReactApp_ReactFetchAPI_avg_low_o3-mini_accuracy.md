# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type  
  The input element has an onChange handler that calls setSearchTerm with the current value, correctly updating state when a user types.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls  
  The useEffect hook sets a timeout of 500ms before updating debouncedSearchTerm, which falls within the required delay window.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured  
  The code uses axios.get with the appropriate configuration and awaits the response, handling the API call as expected.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses  
  Interfaces for Character and PeopleResponse are defined and used correctly, and TypeScript generics (e.g., in axios.get) are applied. While the component props and state in ErrorBoundary are typed, there may be minor improvements possible. Hence, a slight deduction in confidence.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters  
  The API endpoint is built dynamically by including the debouncedSearchTerm in the query string, ensuring that the search parameter is passed correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate  
  The fetchCharacters function is wrapped in useCallback and the character list rendering is memoized using useMemo, which optimizes performance.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback  
  A try-catch block is used in the fetchCharacters async function to catch errors, update the error state, log the error, and display an error message in the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing  
  The debouncing technique ensures that the API call is only made after the user stops typing for 500ms, preventing excessive calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices  
  React's useState hook is used for managing local state, and the separation between searchTerm and debouncedSearchTerm follows a common debouncing pattern in React.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code  
  All imported modules and hooks are used appropriately, and the code does not include extraneous commented-out sections.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests  
  The loading state is set to true before initiating the API call and reset to false in the finally block, ensuring accurate UI feedback during data fetches.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns  
  The functional component utilizes hooks correctly, and the error boundary implementation (via a class component) remains a valid pattern in React 18.
