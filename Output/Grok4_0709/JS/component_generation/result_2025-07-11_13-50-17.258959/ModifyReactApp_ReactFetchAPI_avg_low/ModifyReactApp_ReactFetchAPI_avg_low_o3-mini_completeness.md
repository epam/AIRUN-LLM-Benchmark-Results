# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The code includes an <input> element with an onChange handler updating the searchTerm, which is used to filter characters via an API call.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  The component manages a loading state and displays "Loading..." when loading is true during API requests.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  The initial state of searchTerm is an empty string and the useEffect calling fetchCharacters is triggered on component mount, ensuring data loads even with an empty query.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  As the user types, the searchTerm state updates, and after a debounce period, debouncedSearchTerm gets updated triggering a new API fetch, enabling dynamic updating of search results.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  The rendered output includes a conditional block that displays "No characters found." when the characters array is empty after the loading and error conditions have been handled.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The container uses inline styles (maxWidth, margin, and padding) to ensure the search component adapts well to different screen sizes, indicating responsiveness.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  The component maps over the characters array to render a list of character names, which confirms that search results are displayed after receiving an API response.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  The ErrorBoundary component is implemented using Reactâ€™s error boundary mechanism to catch errors in its child components, thereby providing robust error handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The TypeScript interfaces for Character and PeopleResponse are defined. Additionally, props for React components (including ErrorBoundary and CharacterList) are properly typed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The additional search functionality (debounced input search) works alongside the existing fetching and displaying logic, preserving the original functionality without conflicts.
