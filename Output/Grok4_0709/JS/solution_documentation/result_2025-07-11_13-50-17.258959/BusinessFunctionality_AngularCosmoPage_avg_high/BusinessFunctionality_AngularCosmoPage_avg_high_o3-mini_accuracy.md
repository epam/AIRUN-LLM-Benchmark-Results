  The documentation discusses how unsaved changes are stored in localStorage, with mechanisms to prompt the user to discard, compare, or use the local version, aligning well with the application’s behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation correctly explains the version comparison and management features  
  The explanation covers how each save creates a revision, manages historical tracking, and details version management consistent with the versioning workflow described in the code analysis.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation accurately describes the page deletion workflow  
  The report explains that deletion involves removing the page along with its revisions, extras, and tags, and that confirmations and redirects are used—matching the intended process in the application.
