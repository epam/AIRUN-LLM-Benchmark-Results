# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props
  
  The code consistently uses TypeScript with proper type definitions throughout all files. Interfaces are defined for state objects, function parameters, and return types. Props are properly typed with TypeScript interfaces.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management
  
  Redux Toolkit is properly implemented with createSlice in multiple files (pageSlice.ts, usersSlice.ts, notifySlice.ts). The store is configured using configureStore from Redux Toolkit, and proper type definitions for RootState and AppDispatch are exported.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components
  
  All components in the codebase, specifically PageEditor, are implemented as functional components using React's function component syntax with the FC type.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately
  
  The code makes appropriate use of useState for local state management, useEffect for side effects and data fetching, and useCallback for memoized callbacks. The hooks are used with proper dependency arrays.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource
  
  API communication is implemented using axios in the restApi.ts file, with proper methods for API calls (get, post, put, delete) and appropriate typing for requests and responses.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components
  
  Form handling in PageEditor.tsx uses controlled components where input values are bound to state values and onChange handlers update the state through Redux actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation
  
  React Router v6 is implemented with imports from 'react-router-dom' including useParams, useNavigate, and Route components in App.tsx.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization
  
  Internationalization is implemented using react-i18next with proper setup in i18n.ts and usage in components with the useTranslation hook.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization
  
  While the code structure is organized to facilitate code splitting with feature folders, there's no explicit code showing React.lazy or dynamic imports for code splitting. However, the organization by features suggests that code splitting could be implemented at the route level.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations
  
  React.memo is properly used on the PageEditor component to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks
  
  Dependency arrays are properly used in useEffect and useCallback hooks, ensuring that effects run only when necessary dependencies change.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models
  
  TypeScript interfaces are well-defined for all data models including Content, Revision, Extra, Tag, PageState, UsersState, NotifyState, etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state
  
  Redux selectors are properly implemented and used throughout the codebase, with functions like selectPage, selectUsers, and selectNotify exported from the slice files.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations
  
  Action creators are properly implemented using Redux Toolkit's createSlice for synchronous actions and createAsyncThunk for asynchronous operations with proper handling of pending, fulfilled, and rejected states.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks
  
  A custom useLocalStorage hook is implemented and used appropriately for persistent storage needs, with proper typing and error handling.
