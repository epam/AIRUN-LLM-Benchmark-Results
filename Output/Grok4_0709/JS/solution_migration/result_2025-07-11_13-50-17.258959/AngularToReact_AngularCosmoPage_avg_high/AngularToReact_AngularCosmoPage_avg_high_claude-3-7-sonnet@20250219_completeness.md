# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented

    The code includes comprehensive implementations for creating, updating, deleting, and duplicating pages:
    - Create/save functionality: `savePageThunk` in `pageSlice.ts` with conditional logic for new pages
    - Update functionality: Also handled by `savePageThunk` with different logic for existing pages
    - Delete functionality: `deletePageThunk` in `pageSlice.ts` and UI implementation in `PageEditor.tsx`
    - Duplicate functionality: `savePage(true)` option in `PageEditor.tsx` which passes the duplicate flag to `savePageThunk`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present

    Page type selection is implemented with:
    - A dropdown select element in `PageEditor.tsx` that displays available page types
    - The `updateType` action in `pageSlice.ts`
    - Type validation before saving a page
    - Default selection of the first available type for new pages

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists

    URL auto-generation is implemented in `PageEditor.tsx` with:
    - The `autoURL` state variable to track if auto-generation is enabled
    - Logic in `handleTitleChange` that automatically updates the URL based on the title when `autoURL` is true
    - Proper URL formatting (lowercase, replacing spaces with hyphens, removing special characters)
    - Automatic disabling of this feature when the user manually edits the URL

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented

    Tag management with autocomplete suggestions is thoroughly implemented:
    - Input field for tags in `PageEditor.tsx`
    - `handleTagsChange` function that processes comma-separated tags
    - `autocompleteTags` async thunk in `pageSlice.ts` to fetch tag suggestions
    - UI implementation of tag suggestions with `selectSuggestion` function to select a suggested tag
    - API integration via `contentTagsQuery` in `restApi.ts`

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available

    Publish status options are implemented in `PageEditor.tsx` with:
    - Radio button inputs for "Publish" (Y), "Draft" (N), and "Schedule" options
    - `handlePublishChange` function to update the publish status
    - Appropriate styling for active selection

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented

    Scheduled publishing functionality is implemented with:
    - Conditional rendering of a datetime input when "Schedule" is selected
    - `handleScheduleDateChange` function to update the schedule date
    - Logic in `savePageThunk` to convert the schedule date to a timestamp
    - Special handling for publishing dates based on the selected publish option

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present

    Local storage version comparison and restoration are implemented with:
    - `useLocalStorage` custom hook for managing local storage state
    - Logic in `PageEditor.tsx` to detect newer versions in local storage
    - UI notification when a newer version is detected
    - Options to use, compare, or discard the newer version
    - Functions `localVersion` and `deleteNewerVersion` to handle these actions

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented

    The notification system is implemented with:
    - A dedicated `notifySlice.ts` Redux slice for managing notifications
    - `addNotify` and `clearNotify` actions for adding and clearing notifications
    - Integration in various functions in `PageEditor.tsx` to show success/error messages
    - Different notification styles for success and error messages via the `classes` property

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present

    Form validation for required fields is implemented with:
    - Validation checks in the `savePage` function before submitting
    - Specific checks for URL validity (not empty, not "new")
    - Page type validation to ensure a type is selected
    - Error notifications with specific messages for each validation failure

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled

    All API endpoints are properly implemented in `restApi.ts` with:
    - Content CRUD operations: `contentGet`, `contentSave`, `contentUpdate`, `contentDelete`
    - Content extras management: `contentExtrasSave`, `contentExtrasDelete`
    - Content revisions: `contentRevisionsSave`, `contentRevisionsDelete`
    - Content revision extras: `contentRevisionsExtrasSave`, `contentRevisionsExtrasDelete`
    - Content tags: `contentTagsSave`, `contentTagsDelete`, `contentTagsQuery`
    - Appropriate TypeScript interfaces for all data structures

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented

    Extras management is partially implemented:
    - API endpoints for extras management are present in `restApi.ts`
    - Logic for saving extras is included in the `savePageThunk` function
    - The code handles both content extras and revision extras
    
    However, while the code saves extras in the Redux state and sends them to the API, there doesn't appear to be a specific UI component in the provided code for managing extras (like adding/editing featured images, etc.), although the logic for handling them is present.

- **Pass** (95%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained

    Revision history functionality is implemented in the backend integration:
    - API endpoints for revisions in `restApi.ts`: `contentRevisionsSave`, `contentRevisionsDelete`
    - Logic in `savePageThunk` to create revisions when saving content
    - Handling of revision extras
    
    However, there doesn't appear to be a UI component for viewing or restoring previous revisions in the provided code, although the backend integration for creating revisions is fully implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components

    The code is well-organized with clear separation of concerns:
    - Feature-based folder structure (`features/page`, `features/users`, `features/notify`)
    - Within each feature, further organization into `components`, `services`, and `slices`
    - Business logic in Redux slices and service files
    - UI components in dedicated component files
    - Shared hooks in a separate `hooks` directory
    - Clear separation between UI (React components) and data/state management (Redux)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved

    Translation functionality is fully implemented:
    - Integration with `react-i18next` library
    - `useTranslation` hook in components
    - Translation keys for all UI text
    - An example `i18n.ts` file with English translations
    - Consistent use of the `t()` function for all displayed text

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters

    The URL structure is maintained:
    - Route configuration in `App.tsx` with `/:url` and `/new` routes
    - Use of `useParams` in `PageEditor.tsx` to access the URL parameter
    - Logic to handle special URL values like "new"
    - Navigation with `useNavigate` to the appropriate URLs after actions
