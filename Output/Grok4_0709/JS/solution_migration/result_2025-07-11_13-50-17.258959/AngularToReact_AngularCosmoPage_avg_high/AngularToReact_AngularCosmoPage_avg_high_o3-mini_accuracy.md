# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props  
  Although most components, functions, and props are properly typed and interfaces are provided, a few parts (such as some inline dispatch usages in PageEditor) could be further tightened. This results in a slightly less than perfect confidence.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management  
  The code uses Redux Toolkitâ€™s createSlice in multiple slices (pageSlice, usersSlice, notifySlice) for state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components  
  All components (including PageEditor and App) are implemented as React functional components.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately  
  The code uses useState, useEffect, and useCallback appropriately. While useMemo is not explicitly used, its absence appears justified given the scenario, so overall the hook usage is appropriate.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource  
  The code clearly uses axios for API communication in restApi.ts.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components  
  Inputs and textareas in the PageEditor are controlled components with their values bound to state and modified via onChange handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation  
  The App.tsx file sets up routing using BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization  
  The implementation integrates i18next through react-i18next, which is a commonly used i18n library for React.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization  
  There is no visible implementation of code splitting (e.g., using React.lazy or dynamic imports) in the provided code. This could be an area for further enhancement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations  
  The PageEditor component is wrapped with React.memo, which helps avoid unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks  
  The useEffect and useCallback hooks include appropriate dependencies, ensuring that they are re-run only when necessary.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models  
  Interfaces for Content, Revision, Extra, Tag, PageState, UsersState, and Notify are all defined, ensuring strong typing for data models.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state  
  Redux selectors (selectPage, selectUsers, selectNotify) are defined and properly used with useSelector.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations  
  Action creators such as updateTitle, updateDescription, updateUrl, and others are defined in their respective slices and are used appropriately in components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks  
  A custom hook (useLocalStorage) is defined in hooks/useLocalStorage.ts, which employs useState and useEffect to handle local storage. Although the PageEditor component also directly accesses localStorage, the existence of the custom hook shows an appropriate implementation of local storage functionality.
