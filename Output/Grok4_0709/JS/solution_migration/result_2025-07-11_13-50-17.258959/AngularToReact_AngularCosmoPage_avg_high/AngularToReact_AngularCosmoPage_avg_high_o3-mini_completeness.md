# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
  The code contains actions and thunks for creating (savePageThunk), updating, deleting (deletePageThunk), and duplicating pages, which confirms that full page management functionality is in place.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
  The PageEditor component includes a dropdown for selecting the page type, ensuring this feature is implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
  In the handleTitleChange function, when auto-generation is enabled, the URL is automatically generated from the title using a replacement method.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
  The code implements tag management via handleTagsChange and autocompleteTags thunk along with UI elements that display tag suggestions and allow selecting them.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
  The component provides radio buttons for "publish," "draft," and "schedule" statuses, allowing the user to choose the publish status.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
  The code includes a datetime-local input that appears when "schedule" is selected, ensuring that scheduled publishing dates are captured and used.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
  The PageEditor component uses localStorage to check for a newer version of the page data, and provides mechanisms to restore or discard local changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
  The code uses the notify slice and dispatches notifications via addNotify for various events (e.g., errors, success messages) ensuring feedback is provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
  There are checks in place to validate critical fields such as URL and page type before proceeding with save operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
  The API file defines and implements endpoints for content, tags, extras, revisions, etc. The thunks in the slice use these endpoints appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
  Both in content and revisions API calls, extras are being saved and deleted as part of page saving logic, confirming extras management is handled.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
  The code includes API calls and thunks to manage revisions (saving and deleting) ensuring that revision history is preserved.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
  The project structure shows separation (e.g., services, slices, components) within feature folders, correctly isolating business logic from presentation components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
  The PageEditor, among other parts of the application, uses the useTranslation hook and a separate i18n setup to manage translations, preserving language localization.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
  The routing in App.tsx sets up routes using parameters (/:url and /new), ensuring that the URL structure remains consistent with requirements.
