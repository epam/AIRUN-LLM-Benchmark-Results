# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling
  
  The code clearly shows the use of Angular's Reactive Forms with imports from '@angular/forms' including FormBuilder and FormGroup. The form is created in the ngOnInit method using FormBuilder and configured with various form controls.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)
  
  The validation requirements are implemented in the validators.ts file:
  - nameValidator checks that name length is between 3 and 60 characters
  - emailValidator uses validator.isEmail to check email format
  - passwordValidator checks that password is at least 6 characters

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use
  
  The code implements two async validators:
  - nameAvailabilityValidator calls authService.isName to check if the name is already in use
  - emailAvailabilityValidator calls authService.isEmail to check if the email is already in use
  
  Both are properly implemented as AsyncValidatorFn and return Observables.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched
  
  The FormGroupComponent uses ngClass to conditionally apply 'has-success' and 'has-error' classes based on the control's touched and valid/invalid states. It also shows appropriate glyphicon feedback icons for success and error states.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions
  
  The onSubmit method checks form validity, sets isSubmitting flag, calls authService.signup with form values, and dispatches a signupComplete action upon success using the @ngrx/store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails
  
  The FormGroupComponent's template includes a help-block span that displays error messages when a control is touched and invalid, showing either validation errors or server errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service
  
  The signup component injects Angular's Title service and sets the page title in ngOnInit using the getTitle utility function.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management
  
  The component clearly uses @ngrx/store for state management (imports Store and dispatches actions). However, while we can see the store.dispatch(signupComplete(result)) call, there's no direct evidence of @ngrx/effects in the provided code snippets. The assumption is that effects are defined elsewhere in the application to handle the signupComplete action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress
  
  The submit button in signup.component.html has a [disabled] attribute that disables the button when the form is invalid, pending, or isSubmitting is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses
  
  The subscription to authService.signup includes handlers for both next (success) and error cases. On success, it dispatches an action and resets isSubmitting. On error, it processes error data and sets corresponding form control errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management
  
  The component properly implements OnInit, uses dependency injection, separates concerns (template, component logic, validation), and follows Angular's recommended patterns for reactive forms.

- **Fail** (80%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises
  
  While the code uses observables throughout, which is consistent with HttpClient usage, we don't directly see the implementation of the AuthService methods. The methods appear to return observables (as they're used with .pipe() and .subscribe()), but without seeing the actual service implementation, we can't be 100% certain HttpClient is used instead of promises.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements
  
  The validators return specific error messages:
  - "Name must be between 3 and 60 characters in length"
  - "A valid email address is required"
  - "Password must be at least 6 characters"
  - "This name is already in use"
  - "This email is already in use"
  
  These messages are displayed through the form-group component. However, without seeing the complete requirements document, we can't be 100% certain these are exactly the messages specified.
