# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling.  
   The component imports FormBuilder, creates a FormGroup via fb.group, and uses reactive-form directives (formGroup, formControlName) in the template.

2. **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters).  
   The code uses custom validators (nameValidator, emailValidator, passwordValidator) that check the name length, use the validator library for email format, and ensure the password is at least 6 characters long.

3. **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use.  
   The asynchronous validators (nameAvailabilityValidator, emailAvailabilityValidator) invoke the AuthService methods and utilize RxJS operators through AsyncValidatorFn, fulfilling the requirement.

4. **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched.  
   The FormGroupComponent template applies CSS classes based on the control’s state (touched, valid, or invalid) and conditionally displays feedback icons and error messages.

5. **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions.  
   In the onSubmit method, the component calls authService.signup and dispatches the signupComplete action upon a successful response from the API.

6. **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails.  
   The template includes an element that displays error messages from control.errors (either local validation error or server error) when the field is touched and invalid.

7. **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service.  
   The component sets the page title using this.title.setTitle(getTitle('Signup')) on initialization.

8. **Pass** (90%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management.  
   The component injects @ngrx/store and dispatches an action (signupComplete). While no explicit use of @ngrx/effects is shown in this component, it is common for effects to be handled separately from the component code. This step is considered passed assuming the overall application integrates effects appropriately.  
   Explanation: Confidence is 90% because effects usage is typically defined outside the component and not directly visible here.

9. **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress.  
   The submit button is disabled when form.invalid, form.pending, or isSubmitting is true, which meets the requirement.

10. **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses.  
    The authService.signup call is subscribed to with handlers for both next (success) and error, and error responses update form errors as expected.

11. **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management.  
    The component correctly implements OnInit, uses dependency injection, sets up reactive forms in ngOnInit, and adopts clean separation of concerns.

12. **Pass** (70%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises.  
    Although the component does not directly perform HTTP calls, it delegates API communication to authService.signup. It is assumed that AuthService uses Angular’s HttpClient.  
    Explanation: Confidence is at 70% because the implementation details of AuthService are not provided, so this assumption is based on typical Angular practices.

13. **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements.  
    The custom validators return error objects with messages such as "Name must be between 3 and 60 characters in length", "A valid email address is required", "Password must be at least 6 characters", and appropriate errors for name/email availability. These messages are rendered in the template under the help-block element.
