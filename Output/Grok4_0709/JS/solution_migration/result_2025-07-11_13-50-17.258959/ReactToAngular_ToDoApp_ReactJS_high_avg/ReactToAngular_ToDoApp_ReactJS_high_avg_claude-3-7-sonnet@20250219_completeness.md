# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items
  
  The code shows that the TodoListComponent subscribes to the todos state and displays them in a list using the *ngFor directive with the app-todo-item component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented
  
  The TodoListComponent has a handleNewTodoKeyDown method that dispatches the addTodo action when the Enter key is pressed in the input field.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works
  
  The TodoItemComponent emits a toggle event that the TodoListComponent handles by dispatching the toggleTodo action. This action is processed in the reducer to toggle the completed status of the todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented
  
  The TodoItemComponent has edit functionality with double-click event binding and proper input handling. The TodoListComponent processes the edit, save, and cancel events appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented
  
  The TodoItemComponent has a destroy button that emits a destroy event when clicked. The TodoListComponent handles this by dispatching the destroyTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented
  
  The TodoListComponent has a toggleAll method that dispatches the toggleAll action when the checkbox state changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works
  
  The application uses Angular Router with different routes for 'all', 'active', and 'completed' filters. The TodoListComponent filters the todos based on the route data.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The TodoFooterComponent receives the count of active items as an input and displays it correctly in the template.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items
  
  The TodoFooterComponent has a clear-completed button that emits a clearCompleted event when clicked. The TodoListComponent handles this by dispatching the clearCompleted action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage
  
  The TodoEffects class includes effects for loading todos from localStorage on application start and saving todos to localStorage when they change.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation
  
  The application uses Angular Router with routes for '/all', '/active', and '/completed', maintaining a clear URL structure.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states
  
  The application shows/hides elements based on the presence of todos using *ngIf directives with observable conditions like hasTodos$ and showFooter$. However, there's no explicit empty state message, which might be a minor UX improvement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly
  
  The application properly handles form submissions for adding new todos and editing existing ones, including validation for empty values.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships
  
  The code shows a clear separation of components with proper parent-child relationships and communication through inputs and outputs.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved
  
  The application includes all the necessary business logic for managing todos, including adding, toggling, editing, deleting, filtering, and persisting to localStorage.
