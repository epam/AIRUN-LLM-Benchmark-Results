# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  Although the code does not include explicit version markers (such as package.json entries), its structure, use of Angular modules, and modern coding practices imply that it is built with a recent Angular version (likely Angular 14.x). There is slight uncertainty due to the absence of explicit version information.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The application imports and utilizes StoreModule (both for the root and feature modules) and defines selectors and reducers using NgRx patterns, confirming its role in state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  The code includes EffectsModule configuration in the Angular modules and a dedicated TodoEffects class implementing side effects, which confirms proper usage.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  The application demonstrates well-organized actions, a reducer with appropriate state updates, and selectors for status counts. Minor points could be debated based on specific business rules, but overall the implementation is solid.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  All components such as AppComponent, TodoListComponent, TodoItemComponent, and TodoFooterComponent correctly employ Angular decorators for declaring components and data/event bindings.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  Instead of using React refs, the application employs Angular’s @ViewChild (as seen in TodoItemComponent) to reference DOM elements, which is in line with Angular best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  The components properly use @Input and @Output (e.g., in TodoItemComponent and TodoFooterComponent) to manage data flow and event communication, confirming correct Angular patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  Although there isn’t a separate data service class, the business logic and data handling are effectively managed via NgRx effects (an injectable Angular service) and reducers. This approach is acceptable in the context of a state-managed application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  Constructors in the components (such as TodoListComponent) and the TodoEffects class correctly use Angular’s dependency injection to inject required services like Store and ActivatedRoute.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  The TodoItemComponent explicitly employs ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush, thereby optimizing performance and adhering to modern Angular practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  The application configures routing using RouterModule.forRoot and RouterModule.forChild with clearly defined routes, confirming the usage of Angular Router.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code is modular, well-organized, and leverages Angular best practices. While style can be somewhat subjective, no major deviations from the Angular style guide are evident.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  Interfaces (such as the Todo model) and explicit typing in components and functions are maintained throughout the code, ensuring type safety and clarity.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  The templates are written using Angular HTML syntax rather than JSX, indicating a proper conversion to Angular’s templating system.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  All event handling is performed using Angular’s event binding syntax (e.g., (click), (keydown), (blur)), confirming that the code does not use React-styled event handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  There are no lingering TODO comments or unfinished code markers in the provided code.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  The AppModule employs lazy loading for the Todo module using the loadChildren syntax, ensuring that feature modules are loaded on demand.
