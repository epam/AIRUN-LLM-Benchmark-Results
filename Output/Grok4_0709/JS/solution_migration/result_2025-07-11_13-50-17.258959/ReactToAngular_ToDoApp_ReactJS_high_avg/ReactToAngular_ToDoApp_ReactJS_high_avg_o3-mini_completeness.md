# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The TodoListComponent renders a list of todos using an *ngFor with a conditional filter. When the filter is set to "all", every todo item is displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoListComponent defines the handleNewTodoKeyDown method that listens for the Enter key and dispatches the addTodo action to add a new todo item.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  Both individual toggling (via TodoItemComponent emitting a toggle event) and toggling all items at once (via the toggleAll method in TodoListComponent) are implemented and dispatch the appropriate actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoListComponent handles the edit and save events for a todo item, while the TodoItemComponent sets focus on the input when in editing mode and handles key events to save or cancel editing. Editing is supported end-to-end.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoListComponent provides a destroy method that dispatches the destroyTodo action when the delete button in TodoItemComponent is clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  The main template includes an input checkbox for marking all todos as complete, and this input triggers the toggleAll method which dispatches the toggleAll action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  Routing in TodoModule defines separate paths for 'all', 'active', and 'completed', passing a data filter to TodoListComponent. In ngOnInit the filtering logic adapts the list based on the provided filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooterComponent shows the count of active items via a bound property, which is provided by the TodoListComponent using a constructed activeCount observable.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The TodoFooterComponent includes a "Clear completed" button that emits an event handled in the TodoListComponent, dispatching clearCompleted to remove all completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  The TodoEffects include a loadTodos$ effect to load todos from local storage at startup and a saveTodos$ effect that listens to state changes and writes updated todos to local storage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The routing configuration in both AppModule and TodoModule is set up to support navigation between '/all', '/active', and '/completed' without changing the expected URL structure.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  The TodoListComponent conditionally displays the main section only if there are todos (using an observable hasTodos$). Although there isnâ€™t an explicit "empty state" message, the absence of the main UI generally signals an empty list.  
  Explanation: Confidence is 90% because while no explicit empty-state message is provided, the implementation is typical for minimalist todo apps.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  The input handling for creating new todos uses the correct key detection for submission (Enter key) and prevents default events, ensuring proper form submission behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The overall component hierarchy is well structured: AppComponent hosts the router outlet, TodoModule declares its components with inter-component communication clearly defined via inputs/outputs and centralized state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  The primary functionalities including adding, editing, deleting, toggling, filtering todos, and persisting state remain intact and are implemented following conventional NgRx patterns seen in standard todo applications.
