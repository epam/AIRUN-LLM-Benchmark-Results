# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The code appears to use Angular, but I cannot definitively confirm the exact version (14.x) from the provided code. The syntax and patterns are consistent with modern Angular versions including Angular 14, but there are no version-specific imports or configurations that would conclusively identify it as Angular 14.x specifically.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS
  
  The code clearly uses ES modules with import/export syntax throughout all files, not RequireJS.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management
  
  The code properly implements @ngrx/store with imports from '@ngrx/store' and uses StoreModule.forRoot in the app.module.ts file.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects
  
  The code implements @ngrx/effects with imports from '@ngrx/effects' and properly uses EffectsModule.forRoot in the app.module.ts file.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management
  
  The code contains well-structured actions (todo.actions.ts), reducers (todo.reducer.ts), selectors (todo.selectors.ts), and effects (todo.effects.ts) for todo management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator
  
  Services like FilterService are properly marked with the @Injectable() decorator.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service
  
  The TodoEffects class properly uses localStorage for data persistence with the STORAGE_ID key.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators
  
  All components (AppComponent, TodoHeaderComponent, TodoMainComponent, etc.) use proper @Component decorators with appropriate metadata.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators
  
  The TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective both properly use the @Directive decorator with appropriate selectors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)
  
  The templates correctly use Angular syntax such as *ngFor in the todo-main.component.html and *ngIf in the app.component.html.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))
  
  Event bindings use proper Angular syntax such as (click)="clearCompleted()" in todo-footer.component.html.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])
  
  Property bindings use proper Angular syntax such as [class.completed]="todo.completed" in todo-item.component.html.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed
  
  Lifecycle hooks like ngOnInit and ngOnChanges are properly implemented in components and directives where needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models
  
  TypeScript interfaces are properly defined in todo.model.ts for Todo and TodoState.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services
  
  Dependency injection is properly implemented throughout the application, with services and the Store injected via constructors.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code generally follows Angular style guide conventions with proper naming, organization, and structure. I cannot confirm 100% compliance without examining every detail against the official style guide.

- **Fail** (80%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings
  
  There appears to be a potential issue in the todo-main.component.html where `$event.target.checked` is used in the markAll method, which may cause TypeScript errors since the target property is not properly typed. Modern Angular recommends using `$event.target as HTMLInputElement` for proper typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)
  
  The code properly uses TypeScript features including interfaces, type annotations, and generics throughout.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code
  
  The provided code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design
  
  The components are well-structured with clear responsibilities: todo-header for adding, todo-item for individual items, todo-footer for filters and counts, etc.
