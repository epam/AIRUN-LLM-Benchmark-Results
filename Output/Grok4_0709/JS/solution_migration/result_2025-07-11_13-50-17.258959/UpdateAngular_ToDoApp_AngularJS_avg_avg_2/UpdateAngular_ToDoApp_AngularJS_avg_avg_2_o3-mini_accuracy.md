# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  Although the code is written using Angular (with @angular/core, @angular/router, etc.), there is no explicit version information (e.g. in package.json or version-specific APIs) that confirms it is Angular 14.x. Without explicit version markers, we cannot be 100% sure; hence, I mark this step as failed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
  The code uses modern ES module syntax (using the import/export statements) and does not employ RequireJS.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
  The presence of StoreModule.forRoot({...}), usage of createReducer, and selectors confirms that @ngrx/store is correctly implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
  The code includes EffectsModule.forRoot([...]) and defines TodoEffects with createEffect, demonstrating proper usage of @ngrx/effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
  The code defines actions (e.g., loadTodos, addTodo, toggleTodo, etc.), a reducer (todoReducer), various selectors, and effects (TodoEffects) for managing todos, all of which are appropriately structured.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
  The FilterService is decorated with @Injectable(), and the TodoEffects class (an injectable effect) is also decorated properly.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
  Although localStorage is used to persist data (in TodoEffects via localStorage.setItem and JSON.parse), this persistence is implemented in an effect rather than in a dedicated Angular service. The evaluation step specifically requests data persistence “in a service,” so this does not fully meet the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
  All Angular components (e.g. AppComponent, TodoHeaderComponent, etc.) use the @Component decorator correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
  Both TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective are correctly decorated with @Directive.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
  The templates use Angular template syntaxes like *ngIf, *ngFor, and proper pipe usage (| async).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
  Event bindings (like (click) on buttons, (ngSubmit) on forms) are correctly implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
  Property bindings such as [class.completed] and [(ngModel)] are properly used in the templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
  Lifecycle hooks such as ngOnInit are implemented in components like AppComponent and TodoMainComponent where initialization is needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
  The Todo and TodoState interfaces in todo.model.ts properly define the shape of data models.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
  Constructors in components, services, and effects correctly declare dependencies which Angular injects.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The overall structure, folder organization, and coding style closely follow Angular conventions. Although there is always room for minor improvements, the code is largely compliant. (Confidence is 90% since style evaluations can be subjective.)

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
  Based on the code inspection, there are no obvious issues that would result in console errors or warnings. However, without running the application, we cannot be 100% certain; thus, this is marked with 80% confidence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
  TypeScript features such as strong typing, interfaces, and decorators are used appropriately throughout the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
  The code does not contain leftover TODO comments or commented-out code fragments that could indicate unfinished work.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design  
  Each component, directive, and service appears to have a well-defined role, adhering to the single responsibility principle.
