# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The Header component defines an input element that listens for the 'Enter' key. When pressed, it dispatches the action to create a new todo, confirming the intended behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The App component computes the current filter (nowShowing) based on the URL. It then passes the filtered list to the TodoList component, which renders the todo items as list elements.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  In the Main component, a checkbox labeled "toggle-all" is provided. When its value changes, it dispatches the toggleAll action to update all todos' completion status.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  The TodoItem component includes a checkbox to toggle completion, supports double-click editing, and includes a button to delete the todo item, satisfying this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  The label element in TodoItem uses the onDoubleClick event to trigger an editing mode by setting the editing state, which meets this evaluation step.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  When a todo is in editing mode, pressing the Enter key (detected via keyCode corresponding to ENTER_KEY) calls handleSubmit, which submits the edited todo via the saveTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  The TodoItem component handles the Escape key (ESCAPE_KEY) by resetting the edit text to the original todo title and cancelling editing (setEditing(null)), thus fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  The Footer component shows the activeTodoCount within its rendered output, indicating the number of active (non-completed) todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The Footer component provides navigation links for All, Active, and Completed filters, using conditional styling to reflect the current selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  A "Clear completed" button is conditionally rendered in the Footer when there are completed todos, and it dispatches the clearCompleted action when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  The storage utility (storage.ts) implements functions to load and save todos in localStorage, and the store subscribes to changes to persist the todos data.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  Conditional rendering is evident in the App component, where the Main component is displayed only if there are todos, and the Footer is rendered only when there is an active or completed count.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  The Footer component uses the pluralize utility to correctly choose between "item" and "items" based on the activeTodoCount.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The code is structured into distinct, focused components like Header, Main, TodoList, TodoItem, and Footer, which enhances maintainability and readability.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The project is organized into directories such as /components, /store, /utils, and /types, reflecting a clear separation of concerns by feature and functionality.
