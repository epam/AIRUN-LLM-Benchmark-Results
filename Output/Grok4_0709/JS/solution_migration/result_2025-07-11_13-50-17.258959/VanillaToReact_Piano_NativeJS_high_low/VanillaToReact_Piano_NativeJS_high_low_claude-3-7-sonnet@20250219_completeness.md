# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'
  
  The application includes a header element with an h1 element that has the class "header-title" and contains the text "Virtual Piano".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons
  
  The application includes a div with the class "btn-container" that contains two buttons: one labeled "Notes" and one labeled "Letters". These buttons have appropriate classes and onClick handlers to toggle between the two modes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)
  
  The piano component renders white keys (natural keys) using the whiteKeys array and black keys (sharp keys) using the blackKeys array. The white keys are rendered directly inside the piano div, and the black keys are rendered inside a div with class "keys-sharp".

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes
  
  Each piano key is rendered with data-letter and data-note attributes that correspond to the keyboard letter and musical note respectively. For example: `data-letter={k.letter} data-note={k.note}`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked
  
  The application includes a `playSound` function that plays the corresponding audio file when a piano key is clicked. The `handleMouseDown` function calls `playSound(note)` when a key is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)
  
  Keys are highlighted using the "piano-key-active" class, which is applied conditionally based on whether the note is in the activeNotes set: `${activeNotes.has(k.note) ? 'piano-key-active' : ''}`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes
  
  The application adds keyboard event listeners via useEffect, with the `handleKeyDown` and `handleKeyUp` callback functions. When a key is pressed, the corresponding note is played using the letterToNote mapping.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked
  
  The application maintains an `isLetters` state that is toggled by the "Notes" and "Letters" buttons. The piano component has a conditional class based on this state: `className={`piano ${isLetters ? 'letters' : ''}`}`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes
  
  The application includes a fullscreen button with an onClick handler that calls `handleFullscreen`. This function toggles between fullscreen and normal modes using the Fullscreen API.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly
  
  The application maintains a Set of active notes in state and uses the ref pattern (`activeNotesRef`) to ensure that the current state of active notes is accessible in event handlers without stale closures.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys
  
  The `handleMouseMove` function checks if the left mouse button is pressed (`e.buttons !== 1`) and activates notes as the mouse moves over keys, allowing for dragging across keys to play multiple notes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information
  
  The application includes a footer element with a div that contains the text "2020".
