# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration  
  The code uses ReactDOM.createRoot (a React 18 feature) and follows the Create React App file structure. This confirms an appropriate React 18 and TypeScript setup.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure  
  While the code defines a TypeScript interface (KeyConfig) for representing piano keys, it does not define a dedicated interface for the audio mapping structure. Instead, it uses an inline type (Record<string, HTMLAudioElement>) for soundMapper. The evaluation step expects the use of a dedicated interface to strictly define the audio mapping structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks  
  The main App component is a functional component that uses several React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, and useCallback), confirming compliance with this criterion.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)  
  The code uses useState for managing the state (e.g., isLetters, activeNotes) and useEffect to synchronize the activeNotes ref and add/remove event listeners. This state management approach is appropriate for the UI interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels  
  Keyboard events are attached to the document within useEffect, and the handlers (handleKeyDown and handleKeyUp) correctly use React hooks and ref state to manage active notes. This is an appropriate implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events  
  The code attaches mouse event handlers (onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseOut, onMouseMove) directly to the piano container using React’s synthetic event properties, fulfilling the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment  
  Audio objects are created outside the component scope to avoid unnecessary re-creation, and sound playback is managed by resetting currentTime and playing the sound within a callback, proving the proper handling of audio resources.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility  
  The fullscreen feature is implemented using a simple function (handleFullscreen) that checks document.fullscreenElement and toggles fullscreen mode. Although it assumes modern browser support (without vendor prefixes), this solution is acceptable for current standards.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns  
  Conditional classes are applied using template literals and ternary operators (e.g., for buttons and piano keys), which aligns with common React patterns.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate  
  The code does not utilize React.memo or other component memoization techniques. However, given the small scale of the application and the fact that performance issues are unlikely in this context, the absence of such optimizations is reasonable.  
  (The slight reduction in confidence reflects that while no memoization is used, it is not strictly necessary for this implementation.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations  
  The implementation correctly leverages React lifecycle methods (via useEffect) for attaching/detaching event listeners and uses refs to prevent stale closures, ensuring that the audio playback is handled in accordance with React’s lifecycle.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application  
  Throughout the code, TypeScript typings are used effectively: function parameters and state variables are annotated, and interfaces/Record types enforce type safety.
