# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18.x
  
  The application is using React 18 as evidenced by the use of `ReactDOM.createRoot()` in the index.tsx file, which is a React 18 feature.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript for type safety
  
  The application extensively uses TypeScript throughout all files, with proper type definitions, interfaces, and type annotations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for state management
  
  The application uses Redux Toolkit's `createSlice`, `configureStore`, and `createSelector` functions in the store.ts file for state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm nanoid is used for generating unique IDs
  
  The application imports and uses nanoid from the nanoid package to generate unique IDs for new todos, as seen in the addTodo reducer in store.ts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code uses functional components with hooks instead of class components
  
  All components (App, Header, Main, TodoList, TodoItem, Footer) are implemented as functional components using React hooks like useState, useEffect, useRef, useDispatch, and useSelector.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains the same routing functionality with proper route handling
  
  The application uses react-router-dom with HashRouter and handles routes for filtering todos (all, active, completed) as seen in index.tsx and App.tsx.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Redux store is properly configured with appropriate slices
  
  The Redux store is properly configured using configureStore in store.ts with a todos slice that contains all the necessary reducers for managing todo operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the Redux provider is set up in the application entry point
  
  The Redux Provider component wraps the application in index.tsx, making the Redux store available throughout the component tree.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for all data structures
  
  The code includes proper TypeScript interfaces for Todo, TodosState, and component props like TodoItemProps, ensuring type safety throughout the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows React best practices for component composition
  
  The code follows React best practices by breaking the UI into smaller, reusable components (Header, Main, TodoList, TodoItem, Footer) with clear responsibilities.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles keyboard events properly (Enter key for creating/updating todos, Escape key for canceling edits)
  
  The application properly handles keyboard events in Header.tsx and TodoItem.tsx, with Enter key for adding/updating todos and Escape key for canceling edits.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application maintains local storage persistence if implemented
  
  The application maintains local storage persistence through the saveState function in store.ts, which is subscribed to the Redux store to save todos whenever the state changes.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  The code appears to be free of obvious errors or warnings, but without running the application, I cannot be 100% certain that there are no runtime console errors or warnings.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify the application implements proper error handling
  
  The code includes error handling for localStorage operations in a try-catch block. It also includes validation for input fields and prevents invalid operations like adding empty todos.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the code is optimized with no unnecessary re-renders
  
  The code uses proper optimization techniques like memoized selectors with createSelector to prevent unnecessary recalculations. Components are focused on specific responsibilities to minimize re-renders.
