# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18.x  
  The use of ReactDOM.createRoot in src/index.tsx confirms React 18 usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript for type safety  
  The source files have .tsx extensions and include explicit TypeScript interfaces and type annotations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for state management  
  The store is configured using createSlice from Redux Toolkit.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm nanoid is used for generating unique IDs  
  The code imports nanoid from 'nanoid' and uses it in the addTodo reducer.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code uses functional components with hooks instead of class components  
  All components (Header, Main, TodoItem, etc.) are implemented as functional components using hooks (useState, useEffect, useDispatch, etc.).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains the same routing functionality with proper route handling  
  The application uses HashRouter and a dynamic route ("/:filter?") in src/index.tsx along with appropriate Link components in Footer, ensuring correct routing for filtering.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Redux store is properly configured with appropriate slices  
  The store is created with configureStore using the todosSlice, which defines reducers and initial state correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the Redux provider is set up in the application entry point  
  The <Provider store={store}> wraps the application in src/index.tsx.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for all data structures  
  Interfaces like Todo and TodosState are defined in the store, and type annotations are used for components and hooks.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows React best practices for component composition  
  The application is broken down into clear, reusable components and uses hooks efficiently. Component separation (Header, Main, TodoItem, Footer) adheres to React best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles keyboard events properly (Enter key for creating/updating todos, Escape key for canceling edits)  
  Both Header and TodoItem components correctly handle keyboard events for submitting new todos and editing (using the Enter and Escape keys).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application maintains local storage persistence if implemented  
  The store.ts file loads the initial state from localStorage and subscribes to state changes to persist todos back to localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  No issues are immediately apparent in the code; error logging is even included for localStorage operations.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify the application implements proper error handling  
  The code includes try/catch in the saveState function to handle localStorage errors. However, most error handling is minimal (given the appâ€™s scope), and additional error boundaries are not implemented. This is acceptable for the current use case but could be expanded in a larger application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code is optimized with no unnecessary re-renders  
  Usage of React hooks, selectors with memoization (via createSelector), and functional component structure helps avoid unnecessary re-renders. The code appears optimized for the scale of this TodoMVC application.
