# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist
  
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present
  
- **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values
  
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented
  
- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility
  
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested
  
- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance
  
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering
  
- **Fail** (90%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations
  
  The provided test suite does not explicitly test custom formatOptionLabel implementations. While the test suite is comprehensive in many areas, there's no dedicated test that verifies custom formatting of option labels works correctly. To properly test this feature, there should be a test that provides a custom formatOptionLabel function and verifies the rendered output matches expectations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)
  
- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)
