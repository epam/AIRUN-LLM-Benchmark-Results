# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist  
  The test suite includes a "Rendering" section with a test case ("renders basic structure with default props") that verifies the component is rendered correctly using default props.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present  
  Multiple tests in the "User Interactions" and "Accessibility" sections verify keyboard navigation including arrow keys, Enter, Escape, and focus management.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)  
  The suite includes tests for clicking (to open the menu and select options) and hovering over options.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior  
  While there is a test for controlled behavior ("handles controlled value changes"), there is no explicit test addressing uncontrolled behavior. More explicit tests for uncontrolled scenarios would improve coverage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values  
  Tests like "clears value correctly" and those covering multi-select state changes confirm that appropriate state updates occur on user interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented  
  The test suite verifies that the menu opens (on click or keyboard events) and closes (e.g., on Escape key press) correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality  
  The "filters options based on input" test confirms that typing into a searchable select triggers the filtering behavior and appropriate callback functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist  
  There are tests covering multi-select state, including selecting and deselecting options, ensuring that both single and multiple selections are tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility  
  Accessibility-related tests check for proper ARIA attributes on components and options, as well as validation of certain live regions for screen reader support.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested  
  The test "handles empty options and noOptionsMessage" verifies correct behavior when no options are provided.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states  
  Although the suite includes a test for the loading state ("renders loading state correctly"), it lacks coverage for error states which were expected per the evaluation criteria.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states  
  Tests for disabled behavior are present ("disables interactions when isDisabled is true" and "handles disabled options"), ensuring that disabled options cannot be selected.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance  
  The performance section includes tests verifying that the component handles large data sets and maintains performance without crashing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested  
  Several tests validate correct focus handling, including initial focus, focus trapping, and focus loss after menu closure.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering  
  Tests such as "renders with value and displays SingleValue" and those in the "State Management" section validate that the placeholder and selected values are rendered as expected.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations  
  There is no explicit test targeting custom implementations of formatOptionLabel, which is part of the evaluation criteria.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)  
  The test suite confirms that the component’s callback functions are invoked appropriately during interactions.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)  
  Although the loading state and clear indicator (assumed via an aria-label) are tested, there is no dedicated test verifying the dropdown indicator’s behavior or other indicator components as expected.
