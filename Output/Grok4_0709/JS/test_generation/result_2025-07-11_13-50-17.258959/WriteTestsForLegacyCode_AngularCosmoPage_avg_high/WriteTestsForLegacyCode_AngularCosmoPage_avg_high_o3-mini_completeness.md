# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources  
  The provided test file (tests/rest.spec.js) clearly tests every defined resource from the REST factory.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly  
  The tests in tests/page.spec.js check every property initialized by the Page factory.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly  
  The tests in tests/users.spec.js verify that all default properties are defined and initialized as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods  
  The test suite for pageCtrl (tests/pageCtrl.spec.js) covers a wide range of public methods and interactions including initialization, updates, deletion, and error conditions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller  
  The “Initialization” block in the pageCtrl tests confirms the correct setup of scope variables and default values from the Page factory.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation  
  The tests for titleChange specifically validate that a title with special characters is correctly formatted into a URL-friendly string.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction  
  There is no explicit test for a "saveLocal" function. While the tests cover localStorage interactions via localVersion and deleteNewerVersion, no test is dedicated to a function named saveLocal.  
  Explanation: The evaluation step mentions "saveLocal," but the provided test suite does not include any such function or corresponding tests. This discrepancy leads to a failure on this step.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality  
  The tests in the autocompleteTags block verify that tag suggestions are fetched and that edge cases (such as an empty tag) are handled correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)  
  The savePage tests cover creating a new page, updating an existing page, handling duplicate pages, as well as error conditions and edge cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types  
  Edge cases such as missing page type and URL are clearly tested in the savePage tests with proper notifications on error conditions being asserted.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly  
  The deletePage tests simulate the deletion process, verify related REST DELETE calls, and check that proper redirection and notifications are issued.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions  
  Tests for localVersion and deleteNewerVersion appropriately simulate the reverting and clearing of localStorage data regarding newer page versions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components  
  The suite is described as achieving ~90% coverage, and the tests comprehensively touch on all expected paths, which meets and exceeds the 80% threshold.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling  
  The tests frequently verify that $rootScope.$broadcast is called with the appropriate events and payloads throughout different functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality  
  The tests ensure that the default scheduleDate is set and that the scheduling logic (changing publish status when a scheduled date is in the past) works as intended.
