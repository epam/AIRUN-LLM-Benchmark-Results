- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events  
  Keyboard event handling (enter key for save and escape key for cancel) is verified in tests such as "saves changes on enter key in edit mode" and "cancels edit on escape key".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts  
  The footer tests check for proper rendering and pluralization of the item count (e.g., "1 item left" vs. "2 items left").

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation  
  The tests verify that the appropriate filter (e.g., Active) is highlighted, ensuring correct navigation indication.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The tests ensure that the "Clear completed" button is rendered conditionally and that it correctly triggers the onClearCompleted action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos  
  The TodoModel tests cover adding a new todo, toggling the state, saving changes, and destroying a todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions  
  The tests use a mockSubscribe function that confirms the subscription/inform mechanism is invoked when relevant actions (e.g., add, toggle) occur.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The test ("clears completed todos") validates that only the active todos remain after clearing completed ones.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation  
  The tests assert the generated UUID matches the expected UUID format.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality  
  The test suite correctly validates singular and plural forms for given counts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations  
  The tests cover storing and retrieving data from localStorage, including the edge case where no data is present.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function  
  The tests confirm that the extend function merges objects correctly without mutating the original data.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx  
  The test files follow the proper naming convention (app.test.tsx, todoItem.test.tsx, footer.test.tsx, etc.), with some TS files using a .test.ts extension consistency.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data  
  Sample todo data is consistently provided in tests (e.g., in todoItem.test.tsx with a mockTodo object).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented  
  The app.test.tsx file includes tests for routing functionality, with proper mocks for the Router (global.Router), ensuring the router is initialized with the appropriate configuration.
