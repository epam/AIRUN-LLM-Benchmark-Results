# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
- **Pass**: The `TodoHeader` component contains an input field with the class `new-todo`. The `handleSubmit` function listens for the Enter key press and dispatches the `addTodo` action with the new todo value from the state.

### Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include logic to filter the displayed todos based on the current filter state (`all`, `active`, `completed`). The `TodoList` component displays all todos without considering the filter.

### Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
- **Pass**: The `App` component includes a checkbox with the id `toggle-all` that, when changed, dispatches the `toggleAllTodos` action to toggle the completion status of all todos.

### Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
- **Pass**: The `TodoList` component includes functionality to toggle (`handleToggle`), edit (`handleEdit`), and delete (`handleRemove`) each todo item.

### Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
- **Fail**: The `TodoList` component includes a `handleEdit` function that starts editing on double click, but there is no logic to handle submitting the edited todo by pressing Enter or resetting the editing by pressing the Esc button.

### Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFooter` component displays the count of active items, includes filter functionality, and has a button to clear completed items.

### Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFooter` component includes a button with the class `clear-completed` that, when clicked, dispatches the `clearCompleted` action.
