# Evaluation Report

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Confirm the component includes a search feature in the dropdown.**
   - **Pass**: The component includes an input field that allows users to type and filter options (`handleSearchChange` function).

2. **Check that the component is navigable via keyboard.**
   - **Pass**: The component handles keyboard events (`handleKeyDown` function) for navigation using Arrow keys and selection using Enter key.

   - **Pass**: The `handleEnterKey` function sets `isOpen` to `true` when Enter is pressed and the dropdown is not already open.

5. **Ensure the focus returns to the select component after the dropdown is closed.**
   - **Fail**: There is no explicit code to return focus to the select component after the dropdown is closed.

   - **Pass**: The `handleEnterKey` function sets `isOpen` to `false` after an item is selected.

7. **Verify the dropdown closes upon selecting an item via mouse.**

   - **Pass**: The `handleKeyDown` function sets `isOpen` to `false` when the Escape key is pressed.

9. **Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component.**

### Summary

- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 9
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 7
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 2

### Conclusion

The component meets most of the evaluation criteria but fails to ensure focus returns to the select component after the dropdown is closed and does not handle closing the dropdown when clicking outside the component. These issues should be addressed to fully meet the requirements.
