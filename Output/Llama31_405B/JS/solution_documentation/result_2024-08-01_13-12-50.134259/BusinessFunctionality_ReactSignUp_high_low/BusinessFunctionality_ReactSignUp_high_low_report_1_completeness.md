# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Pass**: Verify that the code implements a signup form for a React application using Redux and `redux-form`.
2. **Pass**: Check for synchronous and asynchronous validation of form fields.
3. **Pass**: Confirm the presence of synchronous validation for name, email, and password fields.
4. **Pass**: Ensure that asynchronous validation checks if the name and email are already in use via API calls.
5. **Pass**: Ensure the form submission sends user data (name, email, password) to the backend API.
6. **Pass**: Verify that successful signup dispatches an action to update the application state.
7. **Pass**: Check that real-time feedback on form validation errors is provided.
8. **Pass**: Ensure success or error messages are displayed based on form submission results.
9. **Pass**: Confirm the presence of a link for existing users to navigate to the login page.
10. **Pass**: Determine if users can enter their name, email, and password into input fields.
11. **Pass**: Verify that real-time validation feedback is provided as users fill out the form.
12. **Pass**: Check if the form submission process includes displaying validation errors or success messages.
13. **Pass**: Assess if the code enables new users to create an account on the platform.
14. **Pass**: Check if user information (name, email, password) is collected for account creation.
15. **Pass**: Determine if the code encourages user engagement by highlighting platform benefits.
16. **Pass**: Verify that the code ensures data integrity by validating user inputs both synchronously and asynchronously.
17. **Pass**: Ensure it prevents duplicate accounts by checking for existing email or name.
