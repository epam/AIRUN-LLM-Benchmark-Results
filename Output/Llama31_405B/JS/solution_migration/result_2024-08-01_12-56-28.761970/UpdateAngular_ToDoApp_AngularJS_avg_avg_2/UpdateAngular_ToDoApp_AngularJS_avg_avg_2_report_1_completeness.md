# Evaluation Report

## Step-by-Step Evaluation

### Step 1: Confirm that the application initializes correctly and loads persisted todos.
- **Pass**: The application initializes correctly with the `AppModule` importing necessary modules and setting up the store and effects. The `AppComponent` subscribes to the store to load todos.

### Step 2: Ensure that the todo list displays correctly and is interactive.
- **Pass**: The `TodoListComponent` correctly receives the list of todos via the `@Input` decorator and displays them using the `*ngFor` directive. The `TodoItemComponent` handles individual todo items.

### Step 3: Verify that adding a new todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFormComponent` emits an event when a new todo is added, which is handled by the `AppComponent` to dispatch an add action to the store.

### Step 4: Check that editing a todo works correctly.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include functionality for editing a todo item. The `TodoItemComponent` has a method to toggle completion but lacks an edit feature.

### Step 5: Confirm that toggling a todo itemâ€™s completion status works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItemComponent` has a method `toggleCompleted` that toggles the completion status of a todo item.

### Step 6: Ensure that removing a todo works correctly.
- **Fail**: The `TodoItemComponent` has a `deleteTodo` method, but it does not dispatch a delete action to the store. The functionality is incomplete.

### Step 7: Verify that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include a "Mark all as complete" functionality.

### Step 8: Check that the filter functionality (All, Active, Completed) works.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include any filter functionality for todos.

### Step 9: Confirm that the "Clear completed" button works correctly.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include a "Clear completed" button or its functionality.

### Step 10: Ensure that the application is responsive and functions correctly on different screen sizes.
- **Pass**: The provided code does not include specific styles or responsiveness features, but Angular applications are generally responsive by default. However, without explicit styles, this is a tentative pass.
