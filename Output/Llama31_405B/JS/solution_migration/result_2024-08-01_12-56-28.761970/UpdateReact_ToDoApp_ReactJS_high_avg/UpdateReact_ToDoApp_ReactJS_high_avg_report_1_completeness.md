## Step-by-Step Evaluation

### Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
**Pass**: The `TodoApp.tsx` file contains an input field with the class `new-todo`. The `handleNewTodoKeyDown` function listens for the Enter key press and dispatches the `addTodo` action with the value from the state.

### Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
**Fail**: The provided code does not include any filtering functionality. The todos are displayed in a list, but there is no implementation for filtering them based on different criteria (e.g., all, active, completed).

### Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
**Pass**: The `TodoApp.tsx` file includes a checkbox with the class `toggle-all` that, when changed, dispatches the `toggleAll` action to toggle the completion status of all todos.

### Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
**Pass**: The `TodoItem.tsx` file includes functionality to toggle (`handleToggle`), edit (`handleEdit` and `handleSave`), and delete (`handleDestroy`) each todo item.

### Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
**Fail**: The `TodoItem.tsx` file includes functionality to start editing with a double click and submit the edited todo by pressing Enter (`handleSave`). However, there is no implementation for resetting the current editing to the initial value when the Esc button is pressed.

### Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
**Fail**: The `TodoFooter.tsx` file displays the count of active items and includes a button to clear completed items. However, there is no implementation for filter functionality.

### Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
**Pass**: The `TodoFooter.tsx` file includes a button with the class `clear-completed` that, when clicked, dispatches the `clearCompleted` action.
