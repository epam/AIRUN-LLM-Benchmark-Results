### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.**
   - **Pass**: All imports in `index.tsx`, `App.tsx`, and `App.css` are used within the code.

2. **Ensure the codebase is structured and follows React best practices (state, hooks, effects).**
   - **Pass**: The codebase uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) appropriately and follows best practices.

3. **Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.**
   - **Pass**: The use of `useEffect` for adding and removing event listeners is correctly implemented, preventing memory leaks.

4. **Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.**
   - **Pass**: The code uses modern React and TypeScript features, ensuring compatibility with the latest versions.

5. **Verify the application works correctly across modern browsers.**
   - **Pass**: The code does not contain any browser-specific features that would prevent it from working across modern browsers.

6. **Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.**
   - **Pass**: The code does not contain any obvious issues that would result in console errors or warnings.

7. **Verify that the new React app initializes successfully without errors.**
   - **Pass**: The initialization code in `index.tsx` is standard and should initialize the app without errors.

8. **Verify that the codebase does not contain any TODOs.**
   - **Pass**: The codebase does not contain any TODO comments.

9. **Ensure the application has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.**
   - **Pass**: The DOM structure and class names in the React components match the original HTML structure.

10. **Verify the application UI matches the original HTML structure visually.**
    - **Pass**: The CSS and JSX structure ensure that the UI matches the original HTML structure visually.

11. **Verify the application handles rapid sequential key presses without audio overlap issues.**
    - **Pass**: The `handlePlay` function resets the `currentTime` of the audio before playing, preventing audio overlap issues.
