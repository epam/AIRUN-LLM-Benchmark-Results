# Evaluation Report

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Verify the application contains a button container with "Notes" and "Letters" buttons.**
   - **Pass**: The application contains a button container with "Notes" and "Letters" buttons in the `btn-container` div.

2. **Verify the application renders piano keys for both natural and sharp notes.**
   - **Pass**: The application renders piano keys for both natural and sharp notes using the `pianoKeys` array and the `piano-key` and `piano-key sharp` classes.

3. **Verify clicking on a piano key plays the correct sound and highlights the key.**
   - **Pass**: The `handleMouseDown` function plays the correct sound and highlights the key by adding the note to the `played` state and applying the `piano-key-active` class.

4. **Verify releasing the mouse button or moving the cursor out of the key stops the sound and removes the highlight.**
   - **Pass**: The `handleMouseUp` and `handleMouseMove` functions remove the note from the `played` state, which stops the sound and removes the highlight.

5. **Verify pressing and releasing keyboard keys play and stop the corresponding piano notes.**
   - **Pass**: The `handlePlay` function plays the corresponding piano note on key press, and the `handleResetActive` function stops the note on key release.

6. **Verify clicking the "Notes" button displays note names on the keys.**
   - **Pass**: Clicking the "Notes" button sets `isLetters` to `false`, which displays note names on the keys by removing the `letters` class from the `piano` div.

7. **Verify clicking the "Letters" button displays letter names on the keys.**
   - **Pass**: Clicking the "Letters" button sets `isLetters` to `true`, which displays letter names on the keys by adding the `letters` class to the `piano` div.

8. **Verify the fullscreen button toggles fullscreen mode for the application.**
   - **Pass**: The `handleFullscreen` function toggles fullscreen mode by calling `requestFullscreen` or `exitFullscreen` based on the current fullscreen state.

9. **Verify the application correctly handles simultaneous multiple key presses.**
   - **Pass**: The application correctly handles simultaneous multiple key presses by allowing multiple notes to be added to the `played` state and played simultaneously.
