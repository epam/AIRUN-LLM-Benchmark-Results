### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Pass**: Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.
   - All imports (`React`, `useEffect`, `useState`, `useMemo`, `axios`) are used in the code.

2. **Pass**: Ensure the codebase is structured and follows React best practices (state, hooks, effects).
   - The code uses `useState` for state management, `useEffect` for side effects, and `useMemo` for memoization.

3. **Pass**: Check that a debounced function is used to optimize the search requests.
   - The `debouncedFetchCharacters` function is implemented using `useMemo` to debounce API requests.

4. **Pass**: Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.
   - The debounced function and `useEffect` are correctly implemented to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

5. **Pass**: Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.
   - The code uses modern React hooks and TypeScript interfaces.

6. **Pass**: Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.
   - The code does not contain any obvious issues that would cause console errors or warnings.

7. **Pass**: Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.
   - The search input value is managed using React state (`searchQuery`).

8. **Pass**: Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React’s virtual DOM.
   - The code does not directly manipulate the DOM.

9. **Pass**: Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React’s state and props.
   - The code does not use refs for DOM access.

10. **Pass**: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
    - The code is concise and does not contain duplicate logic.

11. **Pass**: Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.
    - The use of `useMemo` for debouncing helps in reducing unnecessary re-renders.

12. **Pass**: Confirm that the useState is used to capture the search input value.
    - `useState` is used to manage the `searchQuery` state.

13. **Pass**: Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs.
    - The code does not contain any TODO comments.

14. **Pass**: Verify the inclusion of TypeScript in the React application.
    - The code uses TypeScript interfaces (`Character`).

15. **Pass**: Ensure that `axios` is used for making API requests.
    - `axios` is used to fetch data from the API.

16. **Pass**: Validate that the `useEffect` hooks are used correctly for data loading.
    - `useEffect` is correctly used to fetch data when the `searchQuery` changes.
