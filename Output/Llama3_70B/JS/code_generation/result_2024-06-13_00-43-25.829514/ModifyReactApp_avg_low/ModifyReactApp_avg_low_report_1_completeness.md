# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Check that a loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.**
   - **Pass**: The code includes a loading state (`loading`) and conditionally renders a "Loading..." message when `loading` is `true`.

2. **Verify that the loader does not hide the search input when data is loading.**
   - **Fail**: The current implementation conditionally renders the entire component based on the `loading` state, which means the search input is not displayed while loading.

3. **Validate that a request with an empty search term is sent on the initial render.**
   - **Pass**: The `useEffect` hook calls `fetchCharacters` with the initial `searchQuery` state, which is an empty string.

4. **Verify that the search input field is present.**
   - **Pass**: The code includes an `input` field for search with the type `search`.

5. **Ensure that the character search functionality is implemented.**
   - **Pass**: The code includes a `handleSearchInputChange` function that updates the `searchQuery` state and calls the debounced `fetchCharacters` function.

6. **Ensure that the API request includes the search term as a query parameter.**
   - **Pass**: The `fetchCharacters` function constructs the API URL with the search query parameter.

7. **Validate that the data is loading on initial app load with empty query and then when the search term changes.**
   - **Pass**: The `useEffect` hook ensures that `fetchCharacters` is called on initial render and whenever `searchQuery` changes.

8. **Ensure that the debounced fetch function prevents unnecessary API requests.**
   - **Pass**: The `debouncedFetchCharacters` function uses `setTimeout` to debounce the API requests by 500ms.

9. **Confirm that the character list is updated based on the search results.**
   - **Pass**: The `characters` state is updated with the API response, and the list is rendered based on this state.

10. **Validate that the application handles API request errors.**
    - **Pass**: The `fetchCharacters` function includes a `try-catch` block to handle errors and logs them to the console.

11. **Ensure that the user experience remains smooth without backend overloads.**
    - **Pass**: The debouncing mechanism ensures that the backend is not overloaded with excessive requests.
