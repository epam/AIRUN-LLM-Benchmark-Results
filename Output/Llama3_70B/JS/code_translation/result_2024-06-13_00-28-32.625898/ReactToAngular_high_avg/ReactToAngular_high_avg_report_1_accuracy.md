# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.**
   - **Pass**: All imports in the provided code are used within their respective files.

2. **Ensure the codebase is structured and follows Angular style guidelines and best practices.**
   - **Pass**: The codebase is well-structured, with components, models, and utilities separated into their respective files.

3. **Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of Angular and TypeScript.**
   - **Pass**: The code uses Angular 14.x features and syntax, indicating compatibility with the latest version.

4. **Verify the application works correctly across modern browsers.**
   - **Fail**: The evaluation does not include browser testing, so this cannot be confirmed.

5. **Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.**
   - **Fail**: The evaluation does not include runtime testing, so this cannot be confirmed.

6. **The code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility.**
   - **Pass**: The code is decomposed into multiple components, each handling a specific part of the application.

7. **Code should not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.**
   - **Pass**: The code does not contain any obvious duplicates and follows DRY principles.

8. **Ensure that the translated code is free of errors and warnings when compiled in an Angular environment.**
   - **Fail**: The evaluation does not include compilation testing, so this cannot be confirmed.

9. **App does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of Angular’s framework.**
   - **Pass**: The code does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of Angular’s framework.

10. **App does not overuse Angular references for DOM access instead of Angular’s state and props.**
    - **Pass**: The code uses Angular’s state management and props effectively without overusing direct DOM access.

11. **App correctly uses Angular lifecycle hooks, avoiding infinite loops.**
    - **Pass**: The code correctly uses Angular lifecycle hooks (`ngOnInit`, `ngOnDestroy`) without any indication of infinite loops.

12. **Verify that Angular project setup is correct and all required dependencies are installed.**
    - **Fail**: The evaluation does not include project setup verification, so this cannot be confirmed.

13. **Verify that the state management using NgRx is correctly set up and functions as expected.**
    - **Pass**: The code uses NgRx for state management, with actions, reducers, and effects set up correctly.

14. **Confirm that the application adheres to the given component structure and code organization.**
    - **Pass**: The application adheres to the given component structure and code organization.

15. **Confirm that the application initializes correctly without any errors.**
    - **Fail**: The evaluation does not include initialization testing, so this cannot be confirmed.
