## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Check that the main component displays the header with input for new todos.
- **Pass**: The `app.component.ts` contains a header with an input field for new todos.

### Step 2: Ensure that adding a new todo item works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `handleNewTodoKeyDown` method in `app.component.ts` dispatches an action to add a new todo item.

### Step 3: Verify that the todo list displays all added todo items.
- **Pass**: The `app.component.ts` uses `*ngFor` to iterate over `todos` and display each todo item using the `todo-item` component.

### Step 4: Confirm that toggle functionality works for marking todos as completed.
- **Pass**: The `toggleTodo` method in `app.component.ts` dispatches an action to toggle the completion status of a todo item.

### Step 5: Check that editing a todo item works and updates the todo item correctly.
- **Pass**: The `editTodo` and `saveTodo` methods in `app.component.ts` handle editing and saving a todo item, respectively. The `todo-item.component.ts` also has the necessary logic to handle editing.

### Step 6: Ensure that deleting a todo item removes it from the list.
- **Pass**: The `destroyTodo` method in `app.component.ts` dispatches an action to delete a todo item. The `todo-item.component.ts` also has the necessary logic to handle deletion.

### Step 7: Verify that the footer correctly displays the count of active items.
- **Pass**: The `todo-footer.component.ts` displays the count of active items using the `count` input property.

### Step 8: Confirm that the footer's clear completed button works and removes completed items.
- **Pass**: The `clearCompleted` method in `app.component.ts` dispatches an action to clear completed items. The `todo-footer.component.ts` has a button that calls this method.

### Step 9: Check that filtering todos by "all", "active", and "completed" works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `todo-footer.component.ts` contains links for filtering todos by "all", "active", and "completed".

### Step 10: Ensure that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works correctly.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include a method or functionality to mark all todos as complete.

### Step 11: Check that the application persists todos to local storage and reloads them correctly.
