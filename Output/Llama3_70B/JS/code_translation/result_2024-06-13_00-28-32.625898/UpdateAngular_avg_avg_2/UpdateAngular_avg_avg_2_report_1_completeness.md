# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Confirm that the application initializes correctly and loads persisted todos.
- **Pass**: The `TodoService`'s `init` method is called in `AppComponent`'s `ngAfterViewInit`, which dispatches the `init` action to load todos.

### Step 2: Ensure that the todo list displays correctly and is interactive.
- **Pass**: The `TodoListComponent` uses `*ngFor` to display todos and binds to the `todoSelectors.selectTodos` selector.

### Step 3: Verify that adding a new todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoHeaderComponent` dispatches the `addTodo` action with the new todo title, and the `todoReducer` handles this action to update the state.

### Step 4: Check that editing a todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItemComponent` dispatches the `editTodo` action with the updated todo, and the `todoReducer` handles this action to update the state.

### Step 5: Confirm that toggling a todo itemâ€™s completion status works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItemComponent` dispatches the `editTodo` action with the toggled completion status, and the `todoReducer` updates the state accordingly.

### Step 6: Ensure that removing a todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItemComponent` dispatches the `removeTodo` action, and the `todoReducer` handles this action to remove the todo from the state.

### Step 7: Verify that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works.
- **Pass**: The `TodoService` has a `markAll` method that dispatches the `markAll` action, and the `todoReducer` updates the state to mark all todos as completed.

### Step 8: Check that the filter functionality (All, Active, Completed) works.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include any implementation for filtering todos based on their status (All, Active, Completed).

### Step 9: Confirm that the "Clear completed" button works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFooterComponent` dispatches the `clearDoneTodos` action, and the `todoReducer` handles this action to remove completed todos from the state.

### Step 10: Ensure that the application is responsive and functions correctly on different screen sizes.
- **Pass**: The use of Angular components and CSS should ensure that the application is responsive, although specific responsive design details are not provided in the code.

## Summary

- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 10
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 9
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 1

The code successfully passes most of the evaluation steps, but it lacks the implementation for filtering todos based on their status (All, Active, Completed). This functionality needs to be added to fully meet the requirements.
