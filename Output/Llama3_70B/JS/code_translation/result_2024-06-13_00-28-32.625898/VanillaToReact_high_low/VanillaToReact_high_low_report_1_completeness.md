# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Verify the application contains a button container with "Notes" and "Letters" buttons.
**Pass**: The application contains a button container with "Notes" and "Letters" buttons, as seen in the `btn-container` div.

### Step 2: Verify the application renders piano keys for both natural and sharp notes.
**Pass**: The application renders piano keys for both natural and sharp notes. Natural notes are rendered in the main piano div, and sharp notes are rendered in the `keys-sharp` div.

### Step 3: Verify clicking on a piano key plays the correct sound and highlights the key.
**Pass**: Clicking on a piano key plays the correct sound and highlights the key. This is handled by the `handleMouseDown` function which calls the `play` function, adding the 'piano-key-active' class and playing the sound.

### Step 4: Verify releasing the mouse button or moving the cursor out of the key stops the sound and removes the highlight.
**Pass**: Releasing the mouse button or moving the cursor out of the key stops the sound and removes the highlight. This is handled by the `handleMouseUp` and `handleMouseOut` functions which call the `resetActive` function, removing the 'piano-key-active' class.

### Step 5: Verify pressing and releasing keyboard keys play and stop the corresponding piano notes.
**Pass**: Pressing and releasing keyboard keys play and stop the corresponding piano notes. This is handled by the `handleKeyDown` and `handleKeyUp` functions which call the `play` and `resetActive` functions respectively.

### Step 6: Verify clicking the "Notes" button displays note names on the keys.
**Pass**: Clicking the "Notes" button displays note names on the keys. This is handled by the `handleButtonChange` function which toggles the `isLetters` state, and the class `letters` is conditionally applied to the piano div.

### Step 7: Verify clicking the "Letters" button displays letter names on the keys.
**Pass**: Clicking the "Letters" button displays letter names on the keys. This is handled by the `handleButtonChange` function which toggles the `isLetters` state, and the class `letters` is conditionally applied to the piano div.

### Step 8: Verify the fullscreen button toggles fullscreen mode for the application.
**Pass**: The fullscreen button toggles fullscreen mode for the application. This is handled by the `handleFullscreen` function which checks for `document.fullscreenElement` and toggles fullscreen mode accordingly.

### Step 9: Verify the application correctly handles simultaneous multiple key presses.
**Pass**: The application correctly handles simultaneous multiple key presses. The `play` function ensures that multiple keys can be played simultaneously by checking if the note is already in the `played` state.
