# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
- **Pass**: The `Header` component contains an input field. The `handleKeyPress` function listens for the Enter key and dispatches the `addTodo` action with the current value of the input field.

### Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include any filtering functionality. The `TodoList` component displays all todos without considering any filters.

### Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include functionality to toggle the completion status of all todos at once.

### Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
- **Pass**: The `TodoList` component includes functionality to toggle (`handleToggle`), edit (`handleEdit`), and delete (`handleDelete`) each todo item.

### Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include functionality to start editing on double click, submit on Enter, or reset on Esc. The `TodoList` component allows editing via an input field but lacks the specified behaviors.

### Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
- **Pass**: The `Footer` component displays the count of active items and includes links for filtering (though the filtering functionality is not implemented). It also includes a button to clear completed items, but the button currently only logs to the console.

### Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
- **Fail**: The `Footer` component includes a button to clear completed items, but it does not dispatch any action. It only logs to the console.
