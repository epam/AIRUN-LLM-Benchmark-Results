- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that any code examples provided are syntactically correct and demonstrate proper component usage
- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that accessibility features are accurately documented with correct ARIA roles and attributes

    While the documentation covers accessibility features thoroughly, including ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility, it only specifically mentions `aria-invalid` and `aria-describedby` attributes. For complete documentation, it might be beneficial to include additional ARIA roles that would typically be used in a signup form, such as `role="form"` or other semantic markup. However, the documented attributes are indeed correct and important for accessibility.
