# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x
  
  The code uses the modern React functional component architecture with hooks which is compatible with React 18.x. The import statement `import React, { useState, useRef, useEffect } from 'react';` and the function component declaration with FC type (`React.FC<SearchableSelectProps>`) confirm this.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
  
  The code is correctly written in TypeScript with proper type definitions. Interface declarations for `Option` and `SearchableSelectProps` are well-defined, and type annotations are used throughout the component (e.g., `React.FC<SearchableSelectProps>`, `useState<Option | null>`, `useRef<HTMLDivElement>`, etc.).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling
  
  The component includes the import statement `import './index.css';` and the CSS file is provided in the answer with appropriate styling for the searchable select component.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments
  
  The code is clean, well-structured, and there are no TODO comments or incomplete sections. All functionality appears to be fully implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility
  
  The component properly uses React's useState hook to manage state for various aspects:
  - `isOpen` for dropdown visibility
  - `searchTerm` for the search input value
  - `selectedOption` for storing the currently selected option
  - `highlightedIndex` for keyboard navigation

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props
  
  The component accepts customizable props via the `SearchableSelectProps` interface:
  - `options`: Array of selectable options
  - `onChange`: Callback function for selection changes
  - `placeholder`: Optional text to display when no option is selected

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection
  
  The component implements a comprehensive `handleKeyDown` function with support for:
  - Enter key for opening dropdown and selecting highlighted option
  - Escape key for closing dropdown
  - Arrow keys (Up/Down) for navigating through options

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions
  
  The component uses React's useRef hook appropriately for:
  - `selectRef` for the main component container
  - `inputRef` for the search input field
  - `listRef` for the options list
  
  These refs are used properly for focus management and detecting clicks outside the component.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques
  
  The component implements focus management using useEffect hooks to:
  - Focus on the input field when dropdown opens
  - Return focus to the select container when dropdown closes
  - Scroll highlighted options into view

  However, I'm deducting 10% confidence because while the component does implement focus management, it could be improved by adding a more robust focus trap within the dropdown to ensure keyboard accessibility in all scenarios.

- **Fail** (95%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
  
  The component lacks essential ARIA attributes that would improve its accessibility:
  - Missing `aria-expanded` to indicate dropdown state
  - Missing `aria-controls` to associate the dropdown with the button
  - Missing `role="combobox"` or `role="listbox"` for proper semantic meaning
  - Missing `aria-activedescendant` to indicate the currently highlighted option
  - Missing `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` for screen reader identification

  I'm 95% confident that this fails the criteria because these are standard accessibility requirements for dropdown components.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  The code doesn't contain any obvious issues that would cause console errors or warnings. The component handles events properly and manages state appropriately. I'm deducting 5% confidence because without actual runtime testing, it's difficult to be 100% certain that all edge cases are handled.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component
  
  The component uses state effectively
