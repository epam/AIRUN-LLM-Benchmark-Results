# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  The component description and code indicate that it is built using React 18.x with functional components and hooks.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  The code is in a TSX file, utilizes interfaces for props and option items, and applies type definitions appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  An `index.css` file is provided with styling rules specific to the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  The code is organized, concise, and free of extraneous comments, making it suitable for production use.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  The component employs the `useState` hook effectively to manage the selected option, dropdown open state, and search term.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  The component accepts customizable props such as `options`, `onChange`, and an optional `placeholder`, ensuring reusability.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  The `handleKeyDown` function handles `Enter`, `Escape`, `ArrowDown`, and `ArrowUp` keys to support keyboard navigation and selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  The usage of `useRef` for managing references to the component container, input, and list items complies with best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  Focus is appropriately handled by shifting focus to the search input when the dropdown is open and back to the container when closed.

- **Fail** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  Although the component supports keyboard navigation and includes a `tabIndex`, it does not include explicit ARIA attributes (such as `role="listbox"`, `role="option"`, or `aria-selected`) to enhance screen reader support. This omission affects full accessibility compliance.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  There are no indications in the code that would produce console errors or warnings.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  The component's state management is solid; however, the filtering of options on every render may be slightly optimized (e.g., via memoization) in a scenario with a very large dataset. In the context of typical usage, this is acceptable, so it passes with a slight reservation.
