# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component conditionally renders a <code>div</code> with the class "dropdown" when <code>isOpen</code> is true, ensuring that a dropdown UI element appears as required.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  When the dropdown is open, the component renders an <code>input</code> of type "search" with the class "search-input", meeting this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The code maintains a <code>selectedOption</code> state and allows selection via <code>onClick</code> and keyboard actions, ensuring that only one item is selected at a time.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The <code>handleKeyDown</code> function handles both "ArrowDown" and "ArrowUp" keys to update the <code>highlightedIndex</code>, allowing for keyboard navigation through the options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  When the dropdown is open and an option is highlighted, pressing "Enter" triggers the <code>handleSelect</code> function to select the highlighted option.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  If the dropdown is closed and the component is focused, pressing "Enter" opens the dropdown (<code>setIsOpen(true)</code>), fulfilling the toggle requirement. When the dropdown is open and an option is highlighted, pressing "Enter" selects the option and closes the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  A useEffect hook is used to set focus back to <code>selectRef</code> when <code>isOpen</code> becomes false, ensuring proper focus management.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  Clicking on an option triggers <code>handleSelect</code>, which updates the selection and sets <code>isOpen</code> to false, thus closing the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  The keyboard selection using the "Enter" key (when an option is highlighted) calls <code>handleSelect</code>, which closes the dropdown as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  The "Escape" key case in <code>handleKeyDown</code> sets <code>isOpen</code> to false, ensuring the dropdown closes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  The event listener attached via <code>useEffect</code> listens for clicks outside of <code>selectRef</code> and calls <code>setIsOpen(false)</code> to close the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  When the component is focused (it is focusable as indicated by <code>tabIndex=0</code>), pressing "Enter" opens the dropdown if it is not already open, as handled in the <code>handleKeyDown</code> function.
