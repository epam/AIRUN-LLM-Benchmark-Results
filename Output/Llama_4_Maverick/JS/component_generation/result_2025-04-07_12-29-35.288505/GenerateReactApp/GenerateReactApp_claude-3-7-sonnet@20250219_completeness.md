# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately

    The code handles error states and loading states properly, but there's no explicit handling for an empty array of characters (if the API returns an empty results array). However, if characters is an empty array, it would simply render an empty `<ul>` element, which is technically correct handling. I'm slightly less confident because an explicit empty state message might have improved user experience.
