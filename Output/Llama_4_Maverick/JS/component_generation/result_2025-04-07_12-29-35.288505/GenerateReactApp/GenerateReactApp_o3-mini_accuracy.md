# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses React 18.x or newer by checking the package.json dependencies  
  The package.json shows "react": "^18.2.0", which meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that TypeScript is properly implemented with appropriate type definitions for all components, props, and states  
  The code uses explicit TypeScript interfaces (e.g., for the Character object) and defines component types via React.FC.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Axios is used for API requests to fetch data from the Star Wars API endpoint  
  Axios is imported and used in the fetchCharacters function to get data from 'https://swapi.dev/api/people'.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles API errors gracefully with appropriate error states or messages  
  The code uses a try-catch block with axios.isAxiosError to set an error message on failure, and conditionally renders an error message in the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the character data is fetched on component mount using useEffect hook  
  The useEffect hook is properly implemented to fetch data when the component mounts.

- **Pass** (85%): Verify that the application properly manages component rendering optimization  
  The code mentions implicit use of React.memo for optimization by avoiding unnecessary re-rendering, although no explicit memoization is applied. Given the simplicity of the application, the approach is sufficient; however, explicit React.memo could add clarity in more complex scenarios.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows React best practices using hooks appropriately  
  The application correctly uses React hooks (useState and useEffect) without violating any standard practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't contain any TODO comments or unnecessary code  
  The code is clean and does not include any TODO comments or extraneous code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the codebase has minimal comments that only clarify complex logic when necessary  
  Comments are minimal and the code is self-explanatory, which aligns with the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the API endpoint 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' is being called correctly  
  The axios.get method is correctly targeting the specified endpoint.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application renders without console errors or warnings  
  Based on the provided code and typical React behavior with Create React App, the code should render without console errors or warnings.
