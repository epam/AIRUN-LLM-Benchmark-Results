# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The CharacterList component fetches data from the SWAPI endpoint and displays the characters in an unordered list.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The component checks the loading state and renders a "Loading..." message while data is being fetched.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  Once the API call succeeds, the component maps over the received data (response.data.results) and displays each character's name.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  The provided code contains no search functionality or input fields, adhering to the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each list item displays the character’s name clearly, ensuring proper presentation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The instructions include bootstrapping the project with Create React App using the TypeScript template.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The implementation uses the useState hook to manage characters, loading, and error states effectively.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  The code assigns each <li> a unique key using character.url, ensuring that React can optimize rendering properly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  While there is no explicit “no data found” message, rendering an empty list in case of no characters is a reasonable handling of the empty data state.
