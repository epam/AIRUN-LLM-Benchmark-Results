# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name
  
  The code includes an input element of type "search" with onChange handler that updates the searchQuery state, and this query is used in the API request to filter characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests
  
  The code includes a loading state that is set to true before making API requests and set to false when the request completes. While loading is true, the component returns a loading indicator: `if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;`

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query
  
  The useEffect hook is set up to call fetchCharacters when the component mounts. The initial value of searchQuery is an empty string, so it will fetch all characters initially.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type
  
  The code implements a debouncing mechanism in the useEffect hook that calls fetchCharacters 500ms after the user stops typing. This ensures that search results update dynamically without overwhelming the API with requests.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found
  
  The code includes a conditional rendering that displays "No characters found." when the characters array is empty: `{characters.length === 0 ? (<div>No characters found.</div>) : ...}`

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design
  
  The solution includes CSS classes for responsive design and provides a CSS snippet that includes media queries and responsive styling techniques like max-width, percentages, etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response
  
  After the API response is received, the characters state is updated with the response data, and these characters are mapped to list items in the render method.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed
  
  While the code handles API errors with try/catch blocks and displays error messages, it explicitly states "We did not implement error boundaries in this example..." Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors in their child component tree. No React.Component with componentDidCatch or static getDerivedStateFromError methods is included.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props
  
  The code defines TypeScript interfaces for Character and ApiResponse, and uses proper typing throughout the component, including for state variables and function parameters.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities
  
  The code preserves the original functionality of displaying a list of characters while adding search capabilities. The component structure remains intact, with additional features layered on top.
