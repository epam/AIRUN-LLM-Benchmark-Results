# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type  
  The search input is connected to an onChange handler (handleSearchChange) that calls setSearchQuery with the current input value.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls  
  The useEffect hook implements debouncing by setting a 500ms timeout before calling fetchCharacters and clearing it on cleanup.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured  
  Axios is imported and used with axios.get, and the API endpoint includes the correct parameters configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses  
  The code defines interfaces for Character and ApiResponse, and the component is properly typed as React.FC. All functions have appropriate type annotations.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters  
  The API call is made to 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' with a query parameter { search: query }, which correctly passes the search term.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate  
  The fetchCharacters function is memoized using useCallback, ensuring that it does not get recreated unnecessarily.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback  
  Error handling is provided via a try-catch block in fetchCharacters, where errors are caught, logged, and an error message is set in the component state to be displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing  
  The debouncing mechanism in useEffect ensures that the API call occurs only after a 500ms pause in the user's typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices  
  The component uses useState for managing search queries, characters, loading, and error states, which adheres to standard React best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code  
  The provided code is clean and free from unused imports and extraneous commented-out code, and there is only a purposeful console.error for logging failed API requests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests  
  The loading state is correctly managed by setting it to true before the API call and false once the request is completed, ensuring proper display of a loading indicator.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns  
  The component uses functional components, React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback), and modern TypeScript, which are consistent with React 18.x patterns.
