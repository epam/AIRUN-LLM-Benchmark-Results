# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The implementation includes a search input field with type="search" and an onChange event handler that updates the search query.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  The code checks the loading state and renders a "Loading..." indicator while fetching data.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  On component mount, the useEffect hook triggers fetchCharacters with the initial empty string, ensuring data loads initially.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  The onChange handler for the input combined with a debouncing mechanism ensures that search results update dynamically as the user types.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  When the characters array is empty, the component renders "No characters found." to inform the user.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The provided CSS styles include responsive design cues (e.g., max-width, auto margins, and flexible input width). While basic, they meet the requirement. The slight uncertainty (5%) is due to responsiveness potentially needing more extensive testing across various devices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  The component maps over the received characters and displays them in a list, ensuring that search results are rendered once received.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  Although the code handles errors by updating an error state and displaying an error message, it does not implement React Error Boundaries. For full robustness, especially in production, explicit error boundaries are recommended.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The implementation defines the necessary TypeScript interfaces (Character and ApiResponse) and uses proper typing for state and props.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The new search functionality has been added without removing any of the existing functionality, and the component continues to load and display characters appropriately.
