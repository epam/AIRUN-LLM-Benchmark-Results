# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass** (100%): The documentation clearly identifies all major components (REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and pageCtrl).

2. **Pass** (100%): The documentation explains the purpose of the REST factory for API communication by describing its use of Angular's $resource and its encapsulation of API interactions.

3. **Pass** (95%): The documentation describes several API endpoints exposed in the REST factory (e.g., content, contentRevisions, contentExtras, and contentTags).  
   (Slight uncertainty stems from the absence of details about every possible endpoint, but the major ones are covered.)

4. **Pass** (100%): The documentation explains the Page factory and indicates its role in storing data about the current page (global page variables).

5. **Pass** (100%): The Users factory is mentioned with its purpose for managing user data.

6. **Pass** (100%): The responsibilities and features of the page controller (pageCtrl) are described, particularly in managing the page creation and editing workflow.

7. **Fail** (100%): The documentation does not describe the local storage mechanism specifically for unsaved changes. It only mentions local storage for caching certain data.

8. **Fail** (100%): There is no explanation of version comparison functionality in the documentation.

9. **Pass** (100%): The page creation workflow is described in detail, including user navigation and form filling.

10. **Pass** (100%): The documentation clearly explains the page editing workflow by detailing the process of modifying page attributes.

11. **Fail** (90%): Although the "duplicate" button is mentioned as part of the UI components, the documentation does not describe the page duplication feature in any detail.  
    (The slight uncertainty arises from whether a mention of the button is sufficient description, but the evaluation criteria require a description of the functionality.)

12. **Fail** (100%): The page deletion process is only mentioned as a button labeled "delete" without any further elaboration on the deletion workflow.

13. **Fail** (100%): There is no mention of an auto-URL generation feature from the title.

14. **Pass** (100%): Tag management and autocompletion are well explained, including the tag autocomplete feature that responds to user input.

15. **Pass** (100%): The documentation describes the publication status options (publish, draft, schedule) in both the feature list and the user workflows.

16. **Pass** (100%): Scheduled content publishing is explicitly explained as one of the options available to the user.

17. **Pass** (100%): The documentation describes page revision management, noting that the application maintains a record of changes.

18. **Pass** (100%): The handling of page extras and additional data is mentioned, indicating that additional data (such as metadata) is managed by the system.

19. **Pass** (100%): Form validation mechanisms are described; for example, validation for a valid URL and mandatory page type selection is noted.

20. **Fail** (100%): There is no explanation of error handling during API operations in the documentation.

21. **Fail** (100%): Notification messaging for user feedback is not described anywhere in the documentation.

22. **Fail** (100%): The documentation does not cover the theme-specific page types feature.

23. **Fail** (100%): The documentation does not describe any handling for a featured image, even though such functionality is suggested by the evaluation step.

24. **Pass** (95%): URL validation is mentioned as part of the form validation process.  
    (Some uncertainty exists regarding detailed error handling for URL validation; however, the basic check is covered.)

25. **Pass** (100%): The tag suggestion system based on user input is explained via the autocomplete functionality for tags.
