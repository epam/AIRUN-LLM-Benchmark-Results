# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization
  
  The provided code does not include implementation of code splitting using React.lazy() and Suspense, which is an important technique for optimizing initial load times. There is no evidence of any dynamic imports or code splitting strategy in the migration plan.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks
  
  While there are examples of dependency arrays in useEffect hooks, there's one instance where a dependency array is shown with just a placeholder `[dependency]` without specifying actual dependencies. This is not a complete implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks
