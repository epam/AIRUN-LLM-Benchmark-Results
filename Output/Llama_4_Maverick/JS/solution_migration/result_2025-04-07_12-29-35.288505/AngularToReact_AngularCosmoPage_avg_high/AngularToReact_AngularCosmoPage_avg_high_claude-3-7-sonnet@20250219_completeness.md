# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented

    The provided migration code only implements the update functionality through the `updatePage` reducer and `savePage` API function. There's no implementation for create, delete, or duplicate functionality. These essential operations are missing from the Redux slice and API service.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present

    The page type selection is implemented in the PageEditor component with a select element that maps through `page.themePages`. However, it's incomplete as it only provides the UI element without handling the business logic behind page type selection or loading available types from an API.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists

    There is no implementation of URL auto-generation from title functionality. The code shows input fields for both title and URL, but there's no logic to automatically generate the URL based on the title input.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented

    The code doesn't include any tag management functionality or autocomplete suggestions. While tags are included in the PageState interface, there's no UI component or logic to manage them.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available

    Although "publish" is included in the PageState interface, there's no UI implementation or logic for selecting between publish, draft, or schedule options in the PageEditor component.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented

    The PageState interface includes a scheduleDate field, but there's no UI component or functionality in the PageEditor to set or manage this scheduled date.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present

    While a useLocalStorage hook is defined, it's not implemented for version comparison or restoration of previous versions. The hook only provides basic storage and retrieval of values.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented

    There is no implementation of a notification system for success or error messages in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present

    The code doesn't include any form validation logic for required fields like URL or page type.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled

    The code only includes two basic API functions (getPage and savePage) without covering all the endpoints that would be required for a complete migration. There's no evidence that all original endpoints are properly handled.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented

    There is no implementation of extras management functionality in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained

    The code doesn't include any implementation for revision history functionality.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components

    The code demonstrates a good organization with feature folders, separating Redux slices (business logic) from React components (UI). The file structure shows proper organization with features/page, services, and hooks folders.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved

    The code includes the setup of react-i18next, which is appropriate for handling translations. However, it doesn't show actual implementation of translations within components or loading of translation files that would match the original application.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters

    While there is a route defined for "/pages/:id", there's no evidence that the full URL structure from the original application is maintained, especially considering that the original URL structure and parameters aren't provided in the migration code.
