# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props  
  Although TypeScript is used throughout (in pageSlice, PageEditor, api.ts, etc.), some components (like PageEditor) do not explicitly define prop types since they accept no props, and strict typing for function parameters is applied only where needed. This is acceptable under many configurations, but it could be improved with more explicit interfaces in some cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management  
  The answer correctly uses Redux Toolkitâ€™s createSlice in the pageSlice.ts file.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components  
  All components, including PageEditor and App, are implemented as functional components.

- **Pass** (80%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately  
  The answer makes proper use of useState and useEffect. While useCallback and useMemo are not explicitly shown, their absence is acceptable if they are not needed; however, this lack makes the evaluation slightly lower in confidence regarding their appropriateness.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource  
  The code for API communication uses fetch in the api.ts file, which meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components  
  The PageEditor component employs controlled components for handling input fields.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation  
  The App.tsx file sets up routing properly using react-router-dom.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization  
  The answer integrates react-i18next and includes a basic i18n configuration.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization  
  The provided answer does not demonstrate any code splitting techniques (e.g., using React.lazy or Suspense) for performance optimization.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations  
  The answer suggests wrapping the PageEditor component in React.memo as part of optimization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks  
  The useEffect in the PageEditor component includes a dependency array ([page]), which is correctly implemented.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models  
  The PageState interface is defined in pageSlice.ts. Although interfaces for props in some components (which might be unnecessary if no props are passed) are not explicitly shown, data models are properly typed.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state  
  The useSelector hook is used in PageEditor to correctly access the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations  
  The updatePage action is correctly defined in the slice and used for state updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks  
  The custom hook useLocalStorage is implemented properly for handling local storage access.
