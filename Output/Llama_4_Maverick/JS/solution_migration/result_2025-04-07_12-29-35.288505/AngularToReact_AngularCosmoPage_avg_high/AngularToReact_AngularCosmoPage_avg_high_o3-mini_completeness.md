# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
  The provided migration only implements an update action via the Redux slice (updatePage). There are no create, delete, or duplicate functionalities.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
  The PageEditor component renders a select element for page types using the page.themePages array.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
  There is no logic that automatically generates a URL based on the page title.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
  Although the state has a tags array, there is no UI or logic provided for autocomplete or managing tags with suggestions.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
  The state includes a publish field, but no UI elements or options (like publish, draft, schedule) are rendered for the user to choose from.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
  The state contains a scheduleDate property; however, there is no corresponding UI or logic to manage scheduled publishing dates.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
  While a custom hook for local storage (useLocalStorage) is provided, there is no implementation for comparing versions or restoring data from local storage.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
  There is no implementation of a notification system to handle success or error messages in the migration code.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
  The code does not implement any form validation to enforce that required fields such as URL or page type are filled in.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
  The API service only provides getPage and savePage endpoints. There is no comprehensive handling of all endpoints that might have existed in the original AngularJS code.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
  There is no evidence of any extras management functionality in the provided migration code.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
  There is no implementation or handling of any revision history feature in the migration.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
  The migration code is structured into feature folders (e.g., features/page, services, hooks) which separates business logic from UI components effectively.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
  An i18next configuration is included to support internationalization. However, the configuration appears minimal and does not show full translation resource usage, so while basic translation is preserved, the implementation might not cover all aspects of the original code's translation functionality. (Confidence reduced due to limited details provided.)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
  The React Router configuration includes a Route for "/pages/:id", which aligns with maintaining a similar URL structure and parameterization.
