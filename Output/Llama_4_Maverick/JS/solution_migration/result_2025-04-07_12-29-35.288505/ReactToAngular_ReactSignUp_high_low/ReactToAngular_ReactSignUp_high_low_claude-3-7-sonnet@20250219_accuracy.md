# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling
  
  The component clearly uses Angular's Reactive Forms by importing FormBuilder, FormGroup, and Validators from '@angular/forms', creating a FormGroup with FormBuilder, and binding it to the HTML template using the [formGroup] directive.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)

  The form validation includes all required validations:
  - Name: `[Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3), Validators.maxLength(60)]`
  - Email: `[Validators.required, Validators.email]`
  - Password: `[Validators.required, Validators.minLength(6)]`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use

  The component uses AsyncValidatorService which creates async validators for name and email, checking if they're already in use through the API service's isName and isEmail methods, with appropriate error messages for "nameTaken" and "emailTaken".

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched

  The form fields apply the "has-error" class conditionally when validation fails and the field is touched:
  `[ngClass]="{ 'has-error': signupForm.get('name')?.invalid && signupForm.get('name')?.touched }"`

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions

  The onSubmit method checks form validity, extracts form values, calls the API service's signup method, and dispatches the AuthActions.signupComplete action upon successful response.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails

  Each form field has error messages displayed when validation fails, with specific messages for each validation rule using *ngIf directives to show appropriate error messages conditionally.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service

  There is no evidence in the provided code that Angular's Title service is being used to set the page title. The Title service is not imported, injected, or used in the component.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management

  The component uses @ngrx/store by importing Store and dispatching actions. It also selects state using store.select(). However, there's no direct evidence of @ngrx/effects usage in the provided code, though it may be implemented elsewhere in the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress

  The submit button is disabled when the form is invalid or when submission is in progress:
  `[disabled]="signupForm.invalid || (submitting$ | async)"`

- **Fail** (80%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses

  While the success case is handled by dispatching AuthActions.signupComplete, the error case handler is empty:
  ```typescript
  error: (error) => {
    // Handle error
  }
  ```
  This suggests incomplete error handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management

  The component correctly implements OnInit and OnDestroy interfaces, properly initializes in ngOnInit(), and cleans up subscriptions in ngOnDestroy() using a Subject and takeUntil pattern.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises

  The ApiService uses Angular's HttpClient for making HTTP calls, which returns Observables rather than Promises, following Angular best practices.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements

  While error messages are displayed for validation failures, we cannot confirm they match specified requirements as the requirements document was not provided. The messages seem reasonable but without requirements for comparison, we cannot verify complete conformance.
