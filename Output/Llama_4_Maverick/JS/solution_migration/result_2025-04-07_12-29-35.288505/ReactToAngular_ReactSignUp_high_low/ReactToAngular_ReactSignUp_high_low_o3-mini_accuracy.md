# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The component imports FormBuilder, FormGroup, and Validators from @angular/forms, and uses formBuilder.group(...) to create the form.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The form is defined with Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3), and Validators.maxLength(60) for the name; Validators.required and Validators.email for the email; and Validators.required and Validators.minLength(6) for the password.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  The async-validator.service.ts creates an async validator using forkJoin on observables that call apiService.isName and apiService.isEmail. There is some ambiguity in the logic (for example, the way the field is determined via parent controls is a bit nonstandard) but overall the intent of checking name and email uniqueness asynchronously is implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The HTML template applies ngClass based on the control’s validity and touched status, and displays corresponding error messages.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  In the onSubmit method, when the form is valid, it calls apiService.signup(...) and on success dispatches AuthActions.signupComplete with the returned user data.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The HTML template includes *ngIf blocks beneath each form field to display descriptive error messages when validation fails.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  There is no use of Angular’s Title service or any code that explicitly sets the page title in the provided components.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  Although the component uses @ngrx/store (dispatching actions and selecting state), there is no indication of the use of @ngrx/effects. The evaluation step requires evidence of both; without a reference to effects, this step fails.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button’s disabled property is bound to a combination of form invalidity and the async observable (submitting$), ensuring it is disabled as required.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  While the API call correctly handles the success callback (dispatching an action), the error callback only contains a comment (“// Handle error”) with no actual error handling implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component correctly implements OnInit and OnDestroy, and properly unsubscribes from observables via the destroy$ subject.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  In api.service.ts, Angular’s HttpClient is used for making HTTP requests.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The error messages in the template (e.g., “Name is required”, “Name must be between 3 and 60 characters in length”, “Invalid email address”, etc.) align with what is expected.
