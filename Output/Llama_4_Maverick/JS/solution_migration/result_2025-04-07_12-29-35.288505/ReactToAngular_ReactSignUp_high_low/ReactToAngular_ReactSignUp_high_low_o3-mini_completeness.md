# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component includes all three required form fields: name, email, and password  
  The component and its HTML template clearly declare input fields for name, email, and password.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page includes a heading 'Join PodBaby today.'  
  The HTML template includes an <code>&lt;h2&gt;Join PodBaby today.&lt;/h2&gt;</code> element, matching the requirement exactly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a lead paragraph about membership benefits  
  The template contains a <code>&lt;p class="lead"&gt;</code> element with text describing the membership benefits.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form includes a submit button with appropriate styling and icon  
  The form includes a submit button featuring Bootstrap classes (<code>btn btn-primary form-control</code>) and an icon element (<code>&lt;i class="fa fa-sign-in"&gt;</code>).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a link to the login page with appropriate text  
  A link is provided in the template: <code>&lt;a routerLink="/login"&gt;Already a member? Log in here.&lt;/a&gt;</code>.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the FormGroup component or equivalent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display  
  The component initializes a FormGroup using Angular’s Reactive Forms, and the template uses conditional classes (like <code>has-error</code>) to display errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Icon component or equivalent is implemented for the signup button  
  Although a custom Icon component is not used, the inclusion of the <code>&lt;i class="fa fa-sign-in"&gt;</code> element serves the purpose, acting as an equivalent for displaying an icon.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all validation rules are implemented (name length, email format, password length)  
  The code applies Validators for required, minlength, maxlength (for name), email, and minlength (for password), fulfilling the validation rules.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure asynchronous validation for both name and email uniqueness is implemented  
  The <code>AsyncValidatorService</code> defines an asynchronous validator (using <code>forkJoin</code>) which calls <code>apiService.isName</code> and <code>apiService.isEmail</code>. However, note that the code snippet does not show the <code>forkJoin</code> import from <code>rxjs</code> and contains an unconventional selection mechanism for email vs. name. Despite these quirks, the intended asynchronous uniqueness validation is present.  
  Explanation: The approach shows intent but minor issues (e.g. missing import and ambiguous logic) reduce complete confidence.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the signup API integration is complete with proper error handling  
  The <code>onSubmit</code> method calls <code>apiService.signup</code> and subscribes to the result. However, the error handler simply contains a comment (<code>// Handle error</code>) without a concrete error-handling implementation.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the form layout matches the horizontal form structure specified  
  There is no evidence or CSS class (such as <code>form-horizontal</code> or equivalent layout directives) to indicate that a horizontal form layout is implemented. The structure appears vertical by default.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page has proper document title setting functionality  
  The provided code does not include any mechanism (e.g. using Angular’s <code>Title</code> service) to set or change the document title.
