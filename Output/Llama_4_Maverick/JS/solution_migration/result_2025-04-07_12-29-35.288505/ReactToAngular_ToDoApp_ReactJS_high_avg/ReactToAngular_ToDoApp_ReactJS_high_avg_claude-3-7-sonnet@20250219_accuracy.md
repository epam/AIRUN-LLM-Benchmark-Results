# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The code clearly shows the use of Angular framework with appropriate imports and Angular-specific syntax like `@Component`, `@Input`, `@Output`, and Angular templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
  
  The solution implements NgRx store with proper installation (`npm install @ngrx/store @ngrx/effects @ngrx/store-devtools`) and usage through store selectors, actions, and reducers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
  
  The solution includes a proper implementation of `@ngrx/effects` with a `TodoEffects` class that handles side effects for saving todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
  
  The solution contains proper implementation of actions (`todo.actions.ts`), reducers (`todo.reducer.ts`), and selectors (`todo.selectors.ts`).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
  
  Components properly use `@Component`, `@Input`, and `@Output` decorators as required by Angular.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators
  
  The solution doesn't include any implementation of `@ViewChild` where it would be needed to replace React refs, particularly for the new todo input element.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
  
  Components like `TodoItemComponent` properly use `@Input()` for receiving data and `@Output() EventEmitter` for sending events to parent components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
  
  The solution implements `UtilsService` for handling business logic like pluralization and todo storage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
  
  Dependency injection is correctly implemented through constructor injection in components and services.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
  
  The solution doesn't specify any change detection strategies (like OnPush) where they would be appropriate for performance optimization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
  
  The solution includes Angular Router configuration in `app.module.ts` and uses it in the footer component for navigation between different filtered views.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The solution generally follows Angular style guide conventions with proper naming and organization, though some minor refinements could be made.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
  
  TypeScript interfaces like `Todo` and `TodoState` are properly maintained and used throughout the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
  
  JSX templates are properly converted to Angular HTML templates with appropriate Angular syntax like `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, and event bindings.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
  
  React event handlers are properly replaced with Angular event bindings like `(click)`, `(change)`, and `(keydown)`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs
  
  The solution doesn't contain any TODOs or unfinished code.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules
  
  The solution doesn't implement lazy loading for feature modules. All components are eagerly loaded in the main module.
