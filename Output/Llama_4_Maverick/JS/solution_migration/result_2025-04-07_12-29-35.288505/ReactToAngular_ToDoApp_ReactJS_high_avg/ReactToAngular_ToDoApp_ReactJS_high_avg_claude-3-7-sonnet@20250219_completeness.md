# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented
- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works

    The toggle functionality has a critical issue in the app.component.html file:
    ```html
    <input id="toggle-all" class="toggle-all" type="checkbox" [checked]="(activeTodos$ | async)?.length === 0" (change)="handleToggleAll($event.target.checked)">
    ```
    
    This code attempts to access `$event.target.checked` which is incorrect in Angular. In Angular 14, the correct syntax would be `$event.target['checked']` or defining a specific type. Additionally, the TodoItemComponent doesn't correctly implement the toggle functionality - it only emits the event but doesn't dispatch any action to the store.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented

    The implementation is incomplete. While the TodoItemComponent has the properties and methods for editing, the app.component.html doesn't include the editing state management. There's no mechanism to track which todo is being edited, and the edit/save/cancel events in the TodoItemComponent aren't connected to store actions in the parent component.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented

    The deletion functionality is implemented through the destroyTodo action, but it's not fully integrated in the parent component where the dispatch action should occur when the destroy event is emitted from the TodoItemComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented
- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works

    The filtering mechanism has issues. In app.component.html, there's an undefined 'filter' variable being used without being properly connected to the store:
    ```html
    <app-todo-item *ngFor="let todo of (filter === 'all' ? todos$ : filter === 'active' ? activeTodos$ : completedTodos$ | async)" [todo]="todo"></app-todo-item>
    ```
    
    Additionally, the setFilter action isn't being dispatched in response to route changes, which is necessary for the filter to work correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items
- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage

    The implementation for saving todos to localStorage exists, but there's an issue in the TodoEffects class where it's attempting to pass an Observable directly to the saveTodos method instead of subscribing to it first:
    ```typescript
    tap(() => this.utilsService.saveTodos(this.store.select(selectAllTodos)))
    ```
    
    This won't work as expected since selectAllTodos returns an Observable, but the saveTodos method expects an array.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states
- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly

    The form submission handling for new todos has an issue. In the app.component.html:
    ```html
    <input class="new-todo" placeholder="What needs to be done?" (keydown)="handleNewTodoKeyDown($event, newTodo.value)" #newTodo>
    ```
    
    After adding a new todo, the input field isn't cleared. In a proper implementation, the input value should be reset after a todo is added.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships

    The component relationships aren't properly established. The TodoItemComponent isn't properly connected to the store actions in the parent component. Events from child components need to be handled in the parent component where the appropriate store actions should be dispatched.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved

    Several pieces of business logic are missing or incomplete:
    1. The filter state management is incomplete
    2. The editing functionality is not fully implemented
    3. The handling of local storage persistence
