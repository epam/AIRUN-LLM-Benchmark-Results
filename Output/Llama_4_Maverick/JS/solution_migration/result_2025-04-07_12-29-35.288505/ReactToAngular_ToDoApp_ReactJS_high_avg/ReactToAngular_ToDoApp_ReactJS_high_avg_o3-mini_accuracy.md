# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The migration instructions and Angular CLI command (“ng new …”) imply an Angular 14.x setup. However, there is no explicit version marker in the code. This creates a slight uncertainty.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The code uses StoreModule.forRoot with a reducer, and selectors are defined. This confirms the proper use of @ngrx/store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  @ngrx/effects is present and configured via EffectsModule.forRoot with a TodoEffects class handling side effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  The provided solution contains clear definitions for actions, a reducer with multiple “on” cases, and selector functions. The implementation appears proper.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  All components (e.g., TodoItemComponent, TodoFooterComponent, AppComponent) correctly use the @Component, @Input, and @Output decorators.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  There is no residual use of React refs. Instead, Angular’s template reference variable (e.g., "#newTodo") is used where needed. Although no explicit @ViewChild is present, template variables adequately replace React refs in this context.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  The components communicate via @Input() bindings and @Output() EventEmitter events, ensuring proper Angular inter-component communication.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  The UtilsService is implemented for functions like pluralizing words and managing localStorage (saving/loading todos), demonstrating proper service usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  Constructors in components, effects, and services use dependency injection to obtain dependencies (e.g., Store, UtilsService, Actions), confirming correct DI usage.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  The application relies on Angular’s default change detection. While explicit strategies (like OnPush) are not set, the default behavior is acceptable for this use case. A more performance-focused app might consider explicit strategies.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  The app is configured with RouterModule.forRoot and defines routes for '/', '/active', and '/completed', confirming proper router usage.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The file structure, naming conventions, and component organization largely adhere to Angular’s style guidelines. Minor improvements could be made, but overall the conventions are followed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  The code defines type annotations where needed (e.g., in actions and component inputs), and interfaces like Todo (assumed from import) are used to maintain type integrity.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  The provided UI markup uses Angular HTML syntax (with directives like *ngIf, *ngFor, and property/event bindings) rather than JSX.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  Event handlers in React (e.g., onClick, onKeyDown) have been converted to Angular’s (click), (keydown), etc., confirming the replacement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  There are no TODO comments or leftover code remarks indicating pending tasks.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  The solution does not show any implementation of lazy loading for feature modules. All modules (including the routing) are eagerly loaded in this setup.
