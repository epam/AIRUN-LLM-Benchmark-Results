# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The AppComponent’s template uses an *ngFor directive (even though the expression involving filter could be refined) to loop through and display todo items. This shows the intention to display all todo items.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The AppComponent handles keydown events on the new todo input field. When the Enter key is pressed, it dispatches an action to add a new todo item.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  The code implements a toggle functionality in both the TodoItemComponent and in the reducer (toggleTodo and toggleAll actions). This indicates that the toggling feature is supported.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  Although the TodoItemComponent defines methods (handleEdit, handleSubmit, handleCancel) and emits events for editing, there is no evidence in the parent component (AppComponent) that these emitted events are handled or dispatched. This results in a missing integration of the editing feature.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent emits a destroy event and the destroyTodo action is defined in the reducer; however, there is no binding or dispatching of the destroy event in the parent component. As a result, the deleting functionality is not fully integrated.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  The AppComponent template includes a checkbox (with id "toggle-all") that calls handleToggleAll. This method dispatches the toggleAll action, thereby implementing the “Mark all as complete” feature.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  While routes are defined for '', '/active', and '/completed' and selector functions for different filters exist, the filtering logic in the template relies on an expression that appears not to be effectively wired (mixing async pipes and local variable comparisons). In addition, the state slice for filter is not fully integrated in the logic. Therefore, the filtering functionality is not reliably implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooterComponent receives the count of active todos (via the value from the store) and uses it (along with a pluralization helper) to display the active todo count.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The TodoFooterComponent includes a clear completed button that emits an event, and the AppComponent dispatches the clearCompleted action. This ensures that completed todos are removed when the button is clicked.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  The UtilsService implements saveTodos (storing the todos in localStorage) and loadTodos (retrieving them), while the TodoEffects use these to persist changes. There is a small uncertainty on whether passing the store’s observable directly to saveTodos captures the snapshot correctly, but the overall intent for local storage persistence is implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The RouterModule configuration defines routes for '', 'active', and 'completed', preserving the URL structure required for navigation.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  The template conditionally displays the main section only when there are todo items. However, no explicit UI or message is provided for the case when there are no todo items. This results in a lack of a proper empty state presentation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  The new todo input field listens for the Enter key event to trigger a form submission process, which dispatches an action to add a new todo. This indicates the form submission is handled appropriately.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  While the overall component structure (AppComponent, TodoItemComponent, TodoFooterComponent) is set up, the communication between components is incomplete. Specifically, emitted events for editing and deleting in TodoItemComponent lack corresponding handlers in AppComponent, leading to broken relationships between components.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  Although most business logic (adding, toggling, clearing, marking all as complete, and persistence) is migrated, the missing integration of editing, deletion, and filtering indicates that not all original business logic has been preserved.
