# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The migration guide explicitly mentions Angular 14.x and the Angular CLI command “ng new todo-mvc” is used accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
  All files use TypeScript import/export syntax which confirms the usage of ES modules.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
  The code imports and sets up StoreModule (with a reducer for todos), which confirms @ngrx/store usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
  The provided code includes a TodoEffects class, implementing an effect (saveTodos$) using @ngrx/effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
  The actions (addTodo, removeTodo, toggleTodo, etc.), the reducer handling state transitions, the selectors for accessing todo data, and the effects for handling side effects are all defined, satisfying this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
  The TodoStorageService is annotated with @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }), confirming proper service injection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
  The code uses localStorage in several places. In the reducer initial state the todos are read from localStorage, and in the effects, the saveTodos action triggers localStorage.setItem. In addition, the todo-storage service dispatches a saveTodos action. This fulfills the persistence requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
  All component files (todo.component.ts, todo-list.component.ts, todo-item.component.ts) are annotated with @Component and include proper metadata.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
  Directives such as TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective use the @Directive decorator as required.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
  The templates use Angular’s structural directives like *ngFor (in todo-list.component.html) and *ngIf (in todo.component.html).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
  The components use event binding correctly, e.g., (click)="clearDoneTodos()" and (ngSubmit)="addTodo()".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
  Examples like [class.completed]="todo.completed" correctly leverage Angular’s property binding syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
  Lifecycle hooks such as ngOnInit in the TodoComponent and ngAfterViewInit in the TodoFocusDirective are appropriately implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
  The code references a Todo model (imported from '../models/todo.model'), which indicates the use of TypeScript interfaces or classes for data modeling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
  Usages such as injecting Store in the components and services demonstrate correct dependency injection implementation.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code is well-organized with separation of concerns (components, services, directives). Although there is room for minor improvements (such as further type declarations in selectors or strict checks), the overall structure adheres to Angular best practices.  
  (I am 90% confident because while the code generally follows the conventions, some minor enhancements could be applied.)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
  Based on the provided code and configuration, no issues suggest the presence of console errors or warnings.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
  The code makes use of TypeScript features including type annotations for component properties and usage of interfaces/models, ensuring proper TypeScript integration.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
  The provided source code and comments are explanatory and do not show any lingering TODOs or commented-out code blocks.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design  
  The application separates concerns by having distinct components (TodoComponent, TodoListComponent, TodoItemComponent), directives, and services, which is consistent with the single responsibility principle.
