# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list  
  The code includes a dedicated TodoListComponent that renders the list of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos  
  The TodoComponent contains an input field and an addTodo() method to handle the addition of new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos  
  The TodoItemComponent implements editing functionality with methods (startEditing, doneEditing, revertEditing) to modify todo items.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos  
  Filtering is handled via a FilterPipe in the TodoListComponent template (e.g., using "todos | filter: statusFilter").

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics  
  The footer in todo.component.html displays the count of remaining todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos  
  The TodoComponent.addTodo() method dispatches an action to add a new todo when the form is submitted.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos  
  The editing of todos is implemented in TodoItemComponent, which dispatches an edit action via component communication.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos  
  The TodoItemComponent provides a remove button that dispatches a removeTodo action when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed  
  The TodoItemComponent uses a checkbox to toggle a todoâ€™s completed status, dispatching a toggleTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)  
  The routing configuration along with FilterPipe and statusFilter in the template allow for filtering todos by status.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete  
  The TodoComponent includes a markAll() method and an associated action that updates the completed status for all todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos  
  There is a clearDoneTodos() method in TodoComponent that dispatches an action to remove todos that are marked as completed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos  
  The remainingCount$ observable in TodoComponent is used to show the number of active (not completed) todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage  
  The reducer (and TodoEffects) handle saving todos into localStorage (using JSON.stringify) and reading them during initialization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization  
  The initialState in the reducer retrieves the todos from localStorage (using JSON.parse) ensuring persistence is maintained.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing  
  The todo-item.component.html includes a handler (keydown.escape)="revertEditing()". Additionally, there is a TodoEscapeDirective that emits an event on escape key press.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo  
  Although a TodoFocusDirective is provided in the code, there is no evidence in the templates that this directive is applied to any input field. Without its usage in the relevant template (for example, on the editing input or the new todo input), the auto-focus functionality is not demonstrably active.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original  
  The HTML templates and CSS references (e.g., classes such as "todoapp", "header", "footer") imply that the original visual structure and styling are maintained.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately  
  The addTodo() method checks for non-empty trimmed input and the doneEditing() method removes items if the title is empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter  
  The RouterModule is configured with routes for '', '/active', and '/completed', enabling URL updates according to the filter selection.
