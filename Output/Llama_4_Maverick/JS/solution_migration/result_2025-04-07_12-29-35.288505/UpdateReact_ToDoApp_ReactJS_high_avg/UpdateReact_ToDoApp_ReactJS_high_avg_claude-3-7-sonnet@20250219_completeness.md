# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed
  
  The code includes a `handleNewTodoKeyDown` function in the TodoApp component that checks for the Enter key press and dispatches the `addTodo` action with the trimmed input value.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter
  
  The TodoList component filters todos based on the `nowShowing` value, showing all, active, or completed todos appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos
  
  The TodoList component includes a toggle-all checkbox with a `handleToggleAll` function that calls the `toggleAll` action creator.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted
  
  The TodoItem component provides functions for toggling (`onToggle`), editing (`onEdit`), and deleting (`onDestroy`) individual todo items.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode
  
  The TodoItem component has a label with an `onDoubleClick` handler that triggers the `handleEdit` function to enter editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo
  
  The TodoItem component's `handleKeyDown` function checks for the Enter key and calls `handleSubmit` to save the edited todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value
  
  The TodoItem component's `handleKeyDown` function checks for the Escape key, resets the edit text to the original todo title, and calls `onCancel`.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The TodoFooter component is provided with a count prop, but we don't see the explicit rendering of this count in the provided code, though it is referenced.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The `setNowShowing` action in the Redux slice and its usage in the application components confirm filter functionality for All, Active, and Completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos
  
  The TodoFooter component includes an `onClearCompleted` prop that is presumably connected to a button in the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence
  
  The todoSlice initializes todos from localStorage and updates localStorage after each action that modifies the todos array.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state
  
  While there is conditional class assignment based on todo state (completed/editing), not all conditional UI elements are explicitly shown in the code.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count
  
  There is no explicit code for pluralizing 'item' text based on count in the provided snippets.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components
  
  The application is split into logical components: TodoApp, TodoList, TodoItem, and TodoFooter, each with specific responsibilities.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality
  
  The code is organized with a clear structure: store.ts, features/todo/todoSlice.ts, components/TodoApp.tsx, etc.
