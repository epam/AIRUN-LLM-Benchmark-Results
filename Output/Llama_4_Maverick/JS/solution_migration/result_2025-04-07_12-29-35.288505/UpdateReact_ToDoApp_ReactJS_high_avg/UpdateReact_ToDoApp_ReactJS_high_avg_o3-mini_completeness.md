# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The TodoApp component’s handleNewTodoKeyDown checks for the Enter key and dispatches addTodo, ensuring that new todos are created as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The TodoList component filters todos based on the nowShowing prop using a switch-case structure before rendering the list.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  The TodoList includes an input checkbox that, on change, dispatches the toggleAll action to mark all todos as completed or not completed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  Each TodoItem is rendered with handlers for toggling, editing (via double-click), and deletion. The presence of dispatch calls in TodoList for toggle, destroy, setEditing, and save confirms this functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  The TodoItem component registers an onDoubleClick event on the label which triggers the editing mode via the onEdit handler.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  In the TodoItem component, the onKeyDown event handler detects the Enter key and calls handleSubmit, which submits the edited todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  The TodoItem component’s onKeyDown event handler checks for the Escape key, resetting the editText value to the original todo title and calling onCancel.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  Although the internal code of the TodoFooter component is not shown in detail, its props include a count value, implying that it is responsible for displaying the number of active items.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The TodoFooter component receives the nowShowing prop, which suggests that it is designed to enable filter functionality across All, Active, and Completed views.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  The Redux slice includes the clearCompleted action, and it is passed to the TodoFooter component, indicating that there is a button to clear completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  The todoSlice updates localStorage in each reducer (addTodo, toggleAll, toggle, destroy, save, clearCompleted), ensuring persistence across sessions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  Conditional rendering is implemented in components like TodoItem (for editing states and completed status) and TodoList, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  There is no explicit implementation shown for pluralizing the “item” text based on the active count in the provided code. The TodoFooterProps interface includes a count property, but without concrete code handling singular versus plural text, this requirement is not met.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The application has been refactored into several components (TodoApp, TodoList, TodoItem, TodoFooter) which clearly indicates a well thought out component composition.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The code structure demonstrates organization into separate folders/files for store configuration, features (todoSlice), components, types, and configuration, fulfilling this requirement.
