# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration
  
  The solution correctly shows the use of Create React App with TypeScript template (`npx create-react-app virtual-piano --template typescript`). The code imports React components with TypeScript typing, uses TypeScript interfaces, and includes proper type annotations. The setup also references React 18 features with `ReactDOM.createRoot()` in the index.tsx file.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure

  The solution includes a properly defined TypeScript interface for the sound mapper:
  ```typescript
  interface SoundMapper {
    [key: string]: HTMLAudioElement;
  }
  ```
  This interface is used to type the `soundMapper` object that maps notes to their corresponding audio elements.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks

  All components (`Header`, `Footer`, `Piano`, `PianoKey`, `FullscreenButton`, and `App`) are implemented as functional components using the React.FC type. The components use hooks like useState and useEffect where appropriate for state management and side effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)

  The solution correctly uses:
  - `useState` to manage active keys, button selection state, and UI state
  - `useEffect` to set up and clean up event listeners
  - State updates are handled properly with functional updates where appropriate

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels

  Keyboard event handlers are properly implemented in the Piano component using:
  - `handleKeyDown` and `handleKeyUp` functions
  - Event listeners added and removed with useEffect to prevent memory leaks
  - Proper event typing with KeyboardEvent

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events

  The solution implements all required mouse events using React's synthetic event system:
  - `onMouseDown`, `onMouseUp`, and `onMouseOut` are properly implemented in the PianoKey component
  - Events are correctly typed with React.MouseEvent<HTMLDivElement>
  - A `handleMouseMove` function is defined, though it appears to be defined but not attached to any element

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment

  Audio is handled correctly using the Audio API:
  - Audio objects are initialized in the soundMapper
  - Sound playback is managed with proper methods (.play(), .currentTime)
  - Audio state is managed within the React component lifecycle

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility

  The FullscreenButton component correctly implements fullscreen functionality:
  - Uses document.fullscreenElement to check current state
  - Implements both requestFullscreen() and exitFullscreen()
  - Handles the toggle within a React event handler

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns

  The solution properly uses conditional class application in React style:
  - Uses template literals with ternary operators: `className={`piano ${isLetters ? 'letters' : ''}`}`
  - Uses string concatenation with conditionals for className in PianoKey
  - Button active states are properly toggled with conditional classes

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate

  The solution implements React.memo for the PianoKey component, which is appropriate since this component will be rendered multiple times and benefits from memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations

  The solution handles audio playback with React lifecycle considerations by:
  - Managing sound state within the component
  - Correctly handling play/stop based on user interactions
  - Implementing proper state updates for active keys

  I'm 90% confident because while the implementation is generally correct, there might be edge cases where audio resources could be better managed (e.g., preloading audio, handling errors, or dealing with multiple simultaneous key presses).

- **Pass** (95%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application

  The code generally follows TypeScript strict typing throughout:
  - Components are properly typed with
