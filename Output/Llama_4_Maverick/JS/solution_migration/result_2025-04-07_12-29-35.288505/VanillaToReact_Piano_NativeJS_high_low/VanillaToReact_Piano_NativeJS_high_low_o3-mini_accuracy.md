# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration  
  The code uses Create React App with the TypeScript template (evidenced by the command line instruction) and employs React 18 patterns (e.g., ReactDOM.createRoot).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure  
  The application defines an interface (SoundMapper) to map string keys to HTMLAudioElement objects in the Piano component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks  
  All components (Header, Footer, PianoKey, Piano, FullscreenButton, App) are implemented as functional components using React.FC, and hooks like useState and useEffect are employed appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)  
  The code uses useState for tracking active keys and button selections and useEffect for handling event listeners (e.g., keyboard events) in the Piano component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels  
  Keyboard event listeners (keydown and keyup) are registered in the Piano component via useEffect and removed on cleanup, appropriately handling keyboard interactions for playing sounds.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events  
  The PianoKey component and the Piano component’s event handlers (onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseOut, and onMouseMove) are implemented using React’s synthetic event system.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment  
  Audio resources are instantiated using the Audio constructor, and the code resets the playback (currentTime = 0) before playing each sound, ensuring that sounds are managed appropriately within the React lifecycle.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility  
  The FullscreenButton component employs a straightforward approach to toggle fullscreen mode using document.documentElement.requestFullscreen() and document.exitFullscreen(), which follows common React patterns while considering browser support.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns  
  The code applies conditional class names both in the PianoKey component (for sharp keys and active state) and in the App component (for toggling between Notes and Letters), demonstrating proper usage of React for dynamic styling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate  
  The PianoKey component is wrapped in React.memo to optimize rendering by memoizing the component, preventing unnecessary re-renders when props have not changed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations  
  The Piano component sets up and cleans up keyboard event listeners via useEffect, and the audio playback functions properly manage active keys and playback state, indicating sound integration is handled with lifecycle care.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application  
  The code uses TypeScript interfaces (for audio mapping and component props) and appropriate type annotations in event handlers and state management, ensuring type safety across the application.
