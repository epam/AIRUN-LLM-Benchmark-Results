# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos
  
  The code shows a clear component structure with a `TodoHeader` component included in the `TodoApp`. While the specific implementation of `TodoHeader` is not fully shown, the component structure indicates that it contains the title and input field for creating new todos.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos
  
  The application has a `TodoList` component included in the `TodoApp`, and the Redux state includes a `toggleAll` action that would handle toggling all todos. However, I can't see the complete implementation of the `TodoList` component to confirm the toggle-all checkbox is present.

- **Pass** (80%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button
  
  The code shows a `TodoItem` component mentioned in the component structure, and the Redux actions include `toggleTodo` and `removeTodo` which would handle the checkbox toggle and delete functionality. However, without seeing the full implementation of the `TodoItem` component, I cannot verify with complete certainty.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode
  
  The Redux slice includes an `editTodo` action which would handle updating a todo after editing. The component structure mentions a `TodoItem` component which would likely implement the double-click to edit functionality, but without seeing the full implementation, I cannot verify with complete certainty.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The code clearly shows filtering functionality. The Redux state includes a `filter` property with possible values of 'all', 'active', or 'completed', and there's a `setFilter` action. The `TodoFooter` component includes a `Filters` component with NavLinks for 'All', 'Active', and 'Completed'.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization
  
  The `TodoFooter` component calculates the `activeCount` of remaining todos and displays it with proper pluralization: `<strong>{activeCount}</strong> {activeCount === 1 ? 'item' : 'items'} left`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter
  
  The `Filters` component in the `TodoFooter` uses `NavLink` from `react-router-dom` with a dynamic className that applies 'selected' when the link is active, which would highlight the current selected filter.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist
  
  The `TodoFooter` component includes conditional rendering for the 'Clear completed' button: `{todos.length > activeCount && (...)}`, which means it will only show when there are completed todos.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter
  
  The Redux slice includes an `addTodo` action which would handle creating new todos. The component structure mentions a `TodoHeader` component which would likely implement the input field and handling Enter key press, but without seeing the full implementation, I cannot verify with complete certainty.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos
  
  The Redux slice includes a `toggleTodo` action that finds a specific todo by ID and toggles its completed status, which confirms this functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once
  
  The Redux slice includes a `toggleAll` action that sets all todos' completed status to the provided value, confirming this functionality.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management
  
  The Redux slice includes an `editTodo` action which would handle updating a todo after editing. However, without seeing the full implementation of the component that handles editing, I cannot verify the focus management with complete certainty.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos
  
  The Redux slice includes a `removeTodo` action that filters out the todo with the specified ID from the state, confirming this functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos
  
  The Redux slice includes a `clear
