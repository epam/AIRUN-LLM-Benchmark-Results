# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (90%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos  
  The provided answer references a file named “TodoHeader.tsx” and mentions its inclusion in the component hierarchy, but no code details are shown to confirm that the header actually contains a title and an input field for creating todos. This omission makes it unclear if the required elements are implemented.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos  
  While the solution shows a component named “TodoList” and a “toggleAll” reducer in the slice, there is no visible code snippet demonstrating a UI element such as a toggle-all checkbox. Thus, the implementation of this feature is not clearly evidenced.

- **Fail** (85%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button  
  There is a dedicated “TodoItem.tsx” in the proposed project structure, but no actual code snippet is provided to verify that each todo’s UI includes a toggle checkbox, title display, and a delete button.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode  
  The answer does not include any code or description showing that a double-click on a todo label triggers an edit mode. No implementation details are provided for this behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The solution clearly provides a “Filters” component and uses NavLink from react-router-dom to render links for “All”, “Active”, and “Completed”. This meets the filtering requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization  
  The “TodoFooter” component includes a section for displaying the count of active items with a ternary operator to choose between “item” and “items”, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter  
  The Filters component utilizes NavLink with logic checking the active state to apply a “selected” class. This provides visual feedback for the selected filter.  
  (Slight uncertainty arises from not seeing the full CSS details, but the logic is sound.)

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist  
  The “TodoFooter” component conditionally renders a “Clear completed” button when the number of todos is greater than the count of active todos. Although the button’s import for clearCompleted is assumed, the intended functionality is present.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter  
  The solution mentions and includes a “TodoHeader” component in the project structure, but no code snippet is provided that demonstrates handling user input (e.g., listening for the Enter key). The exact implementation of creating todos is therefore unclear.

- **Fail** (85%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos  
  Although a “toggleTodo” reducer is defined in the todos slice, the UI code (likely in “TodoItem.tsx”) to invoke this action is not shown. This makes it uncertain if individual toggling is fully implemented.

- **Fail** (85%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once  
  The todos slice includes a “toggleAll” reducer, indicating the logic exists. However, no associated UI element (such as a master toggle checkbox) is demonstrated in the provided code snippets.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management  
  There is no code or discussion regarding the UI behavior for editing todos (e.g., switching to an input field and managing focus) even though an “editTodo” reducer exists. This functionality is therefore not verified.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos  
  While a “removeTodo” reducer is part of the todos slice, there is no accompanying UI code (likely in “TodoItem.tsx”) shown that confirms a delete button is present and functioning for individual todos.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos  
  The “clearCompleted” reducer and its use in the “TodoFooter” (i.e., the “Clear completed” button) indicate the functionality is implemented. Minor uncertainty remains due to lack of additional testing details, but the main components are present.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status  
  The solution describes a filtering mechanism through the Filters component, use of the “setFilter” reducer, and routing logic via react-router-dom. Although the complete integration (e.g., the selector logic in “TodoList”) isn’t shown, the explanation suggests filtering is implemented.
