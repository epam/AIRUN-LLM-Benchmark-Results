- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior
  
  The answer includes a specific test for controlled component behavior: `updates value when controlled` which demonstrates using state to control the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values
  
  The answer includes tests for selecting values in multiple test cases, including `selects an option on Enter` and the controlled component test.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested
  
  The answer does not include explicit tests for focus management behaviors during different interactions.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering
  
  The answer indirectly tests placeholder rendering with the test that expects "Select..." text to be present, but doesn't explicitly test custom placeholders or different value rendering scenarios.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations
  
  The answer does not include any tests for custom formatOptionLabel implementations.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)
