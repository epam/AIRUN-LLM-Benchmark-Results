# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist  
   The provided answer includes a test ("renders with default props") that renders the component with default options and checks for the placeholder text "Select...".

2. **Fail** (95%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present  
   The tests cover arrow key navigation, Enter, and Escape behavior. However, there is no explicit test for the Tab key navigation.

3. **Fail** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)  
   While a click event is tested in the "renders with provided options" test, there is no explicit test covering hover interactions.

4. **Fail** (90%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior  
   The answer provides a test for a controlled component ("updates value when controlled"), but it does not explicitly cover the uncontrolled component behavior.

5. **Fail** (95%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values  
   The tests verify that state changes occur when an option is selected. However, there are no tests for removing or clearing selected values.

6. **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented  
   A dedicated test ("opens and closes menu") verifies that the menu opens with the ArrowDown key and closes with the Escape key.

7. **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality  
   A test ("filters options based on input value") is included, which verifies that filtering works correctly.

8. **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist  
   The tests use the isMulti prop in some cases and verify proper ARIA attributes when multiple selections are allowed.

9. **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility  
   Several tests check for proper accessibility attributes (e.g., aria-autocomplete, aria-haspopup, aria-selected), ensuring screen reader compatibility.

10. **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested  
    The test ("displays no options message when there are no options") confirms the componentâ€™s behavior with an empty options array.

11. **Fail** (90%): Validate tests for loading and error states  
    There is a test for the loading state ("displays loading message when isLoading is true"), but there is no test covering error states.

12. **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states  
    The suite does not include any tests for disabled options or disabled component states.

13. **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance  
    A performance test ("renders large number of options quickly") is provided, ensuring the component handles a large number of options.

14. **Fail** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested  
    There are no explicit tests verifying focus management (e.g., focus shifting when interacting with the component).

15. **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering  
    The placeholder ("Select...") is checked in the default rendering test, and the controlled component test confirms that a selected value ("Option 1") is rendered.

16. **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations  
    There are no tests covering custom implementations for formatting option labels, which is an expected advanced feature in some Select components.

17. **Fail** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)  
    The onChange callback is tested ("selects an option on Enter"), but there are no explicit tests for onInputChange, onMenuOpen, or onMenuClose.

18. **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)  
    Although the loading indicator is indirectly tested via the loading state, tests for other indicator components like the dropdown icon or clear indicator are missing.
