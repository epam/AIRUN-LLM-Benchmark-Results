# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)
  
  The provided solution explicitly uses Jasmine as the testing framework along with Karma as the test runner, which are both appropriate modern testing frameworks for AngularJS applications.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints
  
  The solution correctly mocks the $resource service by using $httpBackend to intercept HTTP requests. This is demonstrated in the REST factory test where it uses `$httpBackend.expectGET('/api/content')` to mock API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation
  
  The solution properly uses beforeEach hooks to set up the test environment for each test case, including module loading and dependency injection. It also uses afterEach in the REST factory test to verify no outstanding requests remain.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls
  
  The solution correctly uses $httpBackend to mock HTTP requests, as shown in the REST.spec.js test with `$httpBackend.expectGET('/api/content').respond(200, [])` and then calls `$httpBackend.flush()` to simulate responses.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection
  
  The solution correctly uses AngularJS's dependency injection pattern in the beforeEach blocks, using the inject function to get references to services like _Page_, _REST_, _$controller_, etc.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations
  
  The solution includes $httpBackend.flush() to handle asynchronous HTTP operations, but doesn't explicitly demonstrate more complex promise handling scenarios, such as testing promise chains or error handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies
  
  The solution correctly uses Jasmine's spyOn to mock the behavior of the REST.content.save method in the pageCtrl test, demonstrating proper use of spies.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization
  
  The solution properly organizes tests using describe blocks for test suites and it blocks for individual test cases, following best practices for Jasmine test organization.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls
  
  While the solution shows testing for successful API calls, it doesn't explicitly include tests for error scenarios, such as testing what happens when an API call returns an error status code. The provided tests only show the happy path.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate
  
  The solution does not include any tests that simulate user interactions, such as button clicks, form submissions, or other UI events. It focuses only on service and controller methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage
  
  The solution includes proper cleanup in the REST factory test using `$httpBackend.verifyNoOutstandingExpectation()` and `$httpBackend.verifyNoOutstandingRequest()` in an afterEach block.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested
  
  The test descriptions are clear and descriptive, such as "should have default properties" and "should make a GET request to /api/content", which clearly explain what aspect is being tested.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible
  
  The solution includes some output validation, such as checking that Page factory has expected properties and that controller initializes with correct values. However, some tests focus on implementation details (like verifying that a specific method was called) rather than validating the end results or state changes.
