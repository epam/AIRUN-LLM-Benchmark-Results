# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources

    The provided test for the REST factory only includes very basic tests checking if the REST.blocks and REST.content resources exist, and a single test for a GET request to /api/content. It doesn't test all defined resources comprehensively. Missing tests for other resources and methods that would likely exist in the actual application.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly

    The test for the Page factory only checks three properties (id, title, and description) with a comment "Add more property checks" indicating incomplete testing. Without seeing the actual Page factory code, we can't be sure all properties are being tested.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly

    There are no tests provided specifically for the Users factory, despite it being mentioned as one of the components to test.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods

    The tests for pageCtrl are minimal, only checking initialization of a couple properties and the savePage method. The comment "Add more tests for other controller methods" indicates incomplete testing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller

    The test includes verification of page initialization with `expect($scope.page.id).toBe(Page.id)` and `expect($scope.page.title).toBe(Page.title)`.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation

    There are no tests for the titleChange function or URL auto-generation included in the answer.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction

    No tests are provided for the saveLocal function or localStorage interactions.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality

    No tests are provided for the autocompleteTags function.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)

    The test for savePage only verifies that REST.content.save is called, but doesn't test any conditional branches such as new page creation, duplicate handling, or updates.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types

    No tests for edge cases are included in the provided answer.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly

    No tests for page deletion functionality are provided.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions

    No tests for page version handling or localStorage interactions are provided.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components

    While the answer mentions setting up coverage reporting, it doesn't include actual tests that would achieve 80% code coverage. The provided tests are too limited to reach this threshold.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling

    No tests for event broadcasting or handling are included.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality

    No tests for date handling or scheduling functionality are provided.
