# Evaluation Report

1. **Fail** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources  
   The provided tests check for the existence of resource methods (e.g., REST.blocks and REST.content) and a GET request for REST.content, but they do not guarantee that all defined resources within the REST factory are covered.

2. **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly  
   The test for the Page factory verifies a few properties (id, title, description) but includes a comment to “Add more property checks.” This indicates that not all properties are tested.

3. **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly  
   There are no tests provided for the Users factory at all in the answer.

4. **Fail** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods  
   Although the controller test initializes the controller and checks page initialization and a call to REST.content.save, it does not cover all public methods that may exist within the pageCtrl controller.

5. **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller  
   The test “should initialize page properties” confirms that the controller’s initialization logic works by comparing $scope.page properties to the Page factory values.

6. **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation  
   There is no test provided for a titleChange function, which is expected to handle URL auto-generation.

7. **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction  
   The answer does not include any tests for a saveLocal function or its interactions with localStorage.

8. **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality  
   No test for an autocompleteTags function is present in the answer.

9. **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)  
   The test for savePage only checks that REST.content.save is called, without covering the various conditional branches such as new page handling, duplicate check, or update scenarios.

10. **Fail** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types  
    There are no tests addressing any edge cases such as empty URLs or page types.

11. **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly  
    The answer does not provide any tests for page deletion functionality.

12. **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions  
    There are no tests verifying the handling of page versions or detailed localStorage interactions beyond the minimal controller tests.

13. **Fail** (100%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components  
    Although the answer mentions using karma-coverage and configuring it, no evidence is provided that the tests reach the required 80% code coverage.

14. **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling  
    The answer does not include any tests that check for event broadcasting and handling.

15. **Fail** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality  
    There are no tests addressing date handling or scheduling functionality in the provided test suite.
