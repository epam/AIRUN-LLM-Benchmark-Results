# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (90%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering

    The answer does not explicitly include test files for app.tsx. While there is mention that "we can write tests for `TodoApp`, and other components" similar to the TodoFooter example, no actual test code for app.tsx is provided. I'm 90% confident because there's a chance the app.tsx tests were implied to follow the same pattern as footer.test.tsx.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos

    The answer does not include any tests for adding new todos in the app.tsx component. Only the model tests for adding todos are provided.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos

    No tests for toggling all todos functionality in the app.tsx component are included in the answer.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos

    The answer does not include tests for filtering todos in the app.tsx component.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos

    No tests for clearing completed todos in the app.tsx component are included in the answer.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering

    While the answer mentions that tests for TodoItem can be written similarly to TodoFooter, it does not actually provide any tests for todoItem.tsx rendering.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos

    The answer does not include any tests for toggling, destroying, or editing todos in the TodoItem component.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events

    No tests for handling keyboard events in the TodoItem component are included in the answer.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts

    The answer includes tests for rendering the TodoFooter component with different counts:
    ```typescript
    it('renders correctly with count and completedCount', () => {
      const { getByText } = render(
        <TodoFooter count={2} completedCount={1} nowShowing={ALL_TODOS} onClearCompleted={() => {}} />
      );
      expect(getByText('2 items left')).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation

    The answer includes tests for filter navigation in the TodoFooter component:
    ```typescript
    it('highlights the correct filter link based on nowShowing prop', () => {
      const { getByText } = render(
        <TodoFooter count={2} completedCount={1} nowShowing={ACTIVE_TODOS} onClearCompleted={() => {}} />
      );
      expect(getByText('Active')).toHaveClass('selected');
    });
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos

    The answer includes tests for clearing completed todos in the TodoFooter component:
    ```typescript
    it('calls onClearCompleted when clear completed button is clicked', () => {
      const onClearCompleted = jest.fn();
      const { getByText } = render(
        <TodoFooter count={2} completedCount={1} nowShowing={ALL_TODOS} onClearCompleted={onClearCompleted} />
      );
      fireEvent.click(getByText('Clear completed'));
      expect(onClearCompleted).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
    });
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos

    The answer includes tests for adding, toggling, saving, and destroying todos in the TodoModel:
    ```typescript
    it('adds a new todo', () => {
      const model = new TodoModel('test');
      model.addTodo('New Todo');
      expect(model.todos.length).toBe(1);
      expect(model.todos[0].title).toBe('New Todo');
    });

    it('toggles a todo', () => {
      const model = new
