# Evaluation Report

## Readability

### 1. Deprecated Usage of `PropTypes` from 'react'
**Pass:** The issue of deprecated usage of `PropTypes` from 'react' is correctly identified and fixed by importing `PropTypes` from 'prop-types'.

### 2. Unnecessary Binding of `this` in `handleSubmit`
**Pass:** The issue of unnecessary binding of `this` in `handleSubmit` is correctly identified and fixed by defining `handleSubmit` as an arrow function.

### 3. Wrapping Promises Unnecessarily
**Pass:** The issue of wrapping promises unnecessarily is correctly identified and fixed by returning the promise directly.

### 4. Ambiguous Variable Names in `asyncValidate`
**Pass:** The issue of ambiguous variable names in `asyncValidate` is correctly identified and fixed by renaming variables to more descriptive names.

### 5. Consistent Use of ES6 Syntax
**Pass:** The issue of inconsistent use of ES6 syntax is correctly identified and fixed by using arrow functions consistently.

## Maintainability

### 1. Extracting Validation Logic into Separate Module
**Pass:** The issue of embedding validation logic directly in the `signup.js` file is correctly identified and fixed by extracting validation functions into a separate module.

### 2. Updating Deprecated React-Bootstrap Components
**Pass:** The issue of using deprecated `Input` component from React-Bootstrap is correctly identified and fixed by updating to use `FormGroup`, `FormControl`, and `HelpBlock`.

### 3. Centralizing Error Messages
**Pass:** The issue of hard-coded error messages is correctly identified and fixed by storing error messages in a constants file.

## Performance

### 1. Ensuring Promises Resolve Correctly in `asyncValidate`
**Pass:** The issue of returning `false` instead of a Promise in `asyncValidate` is correctly identified and fixed by always returning a Promise.

### 2. Avoiding Unnecessary API Calls
**Pass:** The issue of performing unnecessary API calls is correctly identified and fixed by checking if values have changed before making API calls.

## Accessibility

### 1. Missing Labels for Form Inputs
**Pass:** The issue of missing labels for form inputs is correctly identified and fixed by using `<label>` elements or `FormLabel` component.

### 2. Adding ARIA Attributes for Error Messages
**Pass:** The issue of error messages not being properly associated with form inputs is correctly identified and fixed by using `aria-describedby`.

### 3. Ensuring Keyboard Accessibility
**Pass:** The issue of ensuring keyboard accessibility is correctly identified and fixed by ensuring all interactive elements can be accessed via keyboard.

## Best Practices

### 1. Avoid Mutating Props
**Pass:** The issue of directly spreading the `field` object into inputs is correctly identified and fixed by only spreading the input props.

### 2. Using Proper PropTypes Definitions
**Pass:** The issue of using `PropTypes.object` is correctly identified and fixed by defining the shape of the `field` prop more precisely.

### 3. Updating to Use Modern React Features
**Pass:** The issue of not utilizing modern React features like hooks is correctly identified and fixed by refactoring to use hooks.

## Testing

### 1. Lack of Unit Tests for Validation Functions
**Pass:** The issue of lacking unit tests for validation functions is correctly identified and fixed by implementing unit tests using Jest.

### 2. Testing `asyncValidate` with Mocked API Calls
**Pass:** The issue of testing asynchronous validation logic is correctly identified and fixed by using mocking to simulate API responses in tests.

## Documentation

### 1. Adding JSDoc Comments to Functions
**Pass:** The issue of lacking descriptive comments is correctly identified and fixed by adding JSDoc comments.

### 2. Documenting Component Usage
**Pass:** The issue of lacking documentation on how to use custom components is correctly identified and fixed by including comments or external documentation.

### 3. Clarifying Error Handling Logic
**Pass:** The issue of unclear error handling logic is correctly identified and fixed by adding inline comments explaining the flow of error handling.
