# Evaluation Report

## Readability

### 1. Deprecated Usage of `PropTypes` from 'react'
**Pass**: The `PropTypes` import is updated to import from the `prop-types` package.

### 2. Unnecessary Binding of `this` in `handleSubmit`
**Pass**: The `handleSubmit` method is defined as an arrow function to avoid unnecessary binding.

### 3. Wrapping Promises Unnecessarily
**Pass**: The code returns the promise directly without unnecessary wrapping.

### 4. Ambiguous Variable Names in `asyncValidate`
**Pass**: Variable names are renamed to more descriptive names for better clarity.

### 5. Consistent Use of ES6 Syntax
**Pass**: Arrow functions are used consistently for better readability.

## Maintainability

### 1. Extracting Validation Logic into Separate Module
**Pass**: Validation logic is moved to a separate module for better maintainability.

### 2. Updating Deprecated React-Bootstrap Components
**Pass**: Deprecated `Input` component is updated to use `FormGroup`, `FormControl`, and `HelpBlock`.

### 3. Centralizing Error Messages
**Pass**: Error messages are centralized in a constants file for easier updates.

## Performance

### 1. Ensuring Promises Resolve Correctly in `asyncValidate`
**Pass**: Promises are always returned, even if the value is not present, to maintain consistency.

### 2. Avoiding Unnecessary API Calls
**Pass**: Logic is implemented to check if values have changed before making API calls to avoid unnecessary network requests.

## Accessibility

### 1. Missing Labels for Form Inputs
**Pass**: Labels are added to form inputs for better accessibility.

### 2. Adding ARIA Attributes for Error Messages
**Pass**: `aria-describedby` is used to link inputs with their error messages.

### 3. Ensuring Keyboard Accessibility
**Pass**: Interactive elements are made accessible via keyboard with a logical tab order.

## Best Practices

### 1. Avoid Mutating Props
**Pass**: Only input props are spread to avoid mutating the entire field object.

### 2. Using Proper PropTypes Definitions
**Pass**: PropTypes are defined more precisely for better type checking.

### 3. Updating to Use Modern React Features
**Pass**: Modern React features like hooks are used where appropriate.

## Testing

### 1. Lack of Unit Tests for Validation Functions
**Pass**: Unit tests are implemented for validation functions using Jest.

### 2. Testing `asyncValidate` with Mocked API Calls
**Pass**: Mocking is used to simulate API responses in tests.

## Documentation

### 1. Adding JSDoc Comments to Functions
**Pass**: JSDoc comments are added to functions for better understanding and maintainability.

### 2. Documenting Component Usage
**Pass**: Comments or external documentation are included to explain how to use custom components.

### 3. Clarifying Error Handling Logic
