# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that a loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass** - The code sets `loading` to `true` before fetching data and displays a loading indicator when `loading` is `true`.

### Step 2: Verify that the loader does not hide the search input when data is loading.
**Pass** - The search input is always displayed regardless of the loading state.

### Step 3: Validate that a request with an empty search term is sent on the initial render.
**Pass** - On initial render, `searchTerm` is an empty string, and the API request is sent without a search parameter.

### Step 4: Verify that the search input field is present.
**Pass** - The search input field is present in the JSX.

### Step 5: Ensure that the character search functionality is implemented.
**Pass** - The search functionality is implemented by updating `searchTerm` state and triggering a new API request.

### Step 6: Ensure that the API request includes the search term as a query parameter.
**Pass** - The API request includes the search term as a query parameter if `searchTerm` is not empty.

### Step 7: Validate that the data is loading on initial app load with empty query and then when the search term changes.
**Pass** - Data is fetched on initial load and whenever `searchTerm` changes.

### Step 8: Ensure that the debounced fetch function prevents unnecessary API requests.
**Pass** - The `setTimeout` with a delay of 500ms ensures debouncing of the API requests.

### Step 9: Confirm that the character list is updated based on the search results.
**Pass** - The character list is updated based on the search results and displayed in the UI.

### Step 10: Validate that the application handles API request errors.
**Pass** - The application catches errors during the API request and logs them, setting `characters` to an empty array.

### Step 11: Ensure that the user experience remains smooth without backend overloads.
**Pass** - The debouncing mechanism helps in preventing backend overloads, ensuring a smooth user experience.
