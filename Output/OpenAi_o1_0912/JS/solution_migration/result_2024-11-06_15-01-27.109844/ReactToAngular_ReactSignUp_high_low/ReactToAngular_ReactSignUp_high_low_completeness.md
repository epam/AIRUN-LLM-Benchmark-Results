# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Verify that all React components and their functionalities are correctly translated into Angular components.
**Pass**: The provided code includes Angular components (`app-form-group.component.ts`, `signup.component.ts`) that correctly translate the functionalities of the React components.

### Step 2: Ensure that the form validation logic is implemented using Angular reactive forms.
**Pass**: The form validation logic is implemented using Angular reactive forms in `signup.component.ts` with validators for required fields, minimum length, maximum length, and email format.

### Step 3: Check that the application includes the necessary form controls and validation rules.
**Pass**: The application includes the necessary form controls (`name`, `email`, `password`) and validation rules in `signup.component.ts`.

### Step 4: Confirm that the application correctly binds the form controls and handles form submission.
**Pass**: The form controls are correctly bound using `formControlName` in `signup.component.html`, and form submission is handled by the `onSubmit` method in `signup.component.ts`.

### Step 5: Ensure the application correctly displays form validation errors.
**Pass**: The application displays form validation errors using the `getErrorMessage` method in `app-form-group.component.ts` and the corresponding HTML template in `app-form-group.component.html`.

### Step 6: Verify that the application contains actions for signup, signup success, and signup failure.
**Pass**: The application dispatches the `signupComplete` action on successful signup in `signup.component.ts`. However, the provided code does not show the actions for signup failure explicitly.

### Step 7: Ensure that the auth.effects.ts file correctly handles side effects using @ngrx/effects, including calling the API and dispatching success or failure actions.
**Fail**: The provided code does not include the `auth.effects.ts` file, so it cannot be verified if side effects are correctly handled using `@ngrx/effects`.

### Step 8: Validate that the API call to signup is correctly integrated and that the response is handled properly.
**Pass**: The API call to signup is correctly integrated in the `onSubmit` method of `signup.component.ts`, and the response is handled by dispatching the `signupComplete` action and managing the `submitting` state.

### Step 9: Confirm that the application navigates to the login page correctly when the link is clicked.
**Pass**: The application includes a link to navigate to the login page using `routerLink` in `signup.component.html`.
