# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
- **Pass**: The `Header` component contains an input field with the class `new-todo`. The `handleAddTodo` function listens for the Enter key press and dispatches the `addTodo` action with the trimmed title from the state.

### Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
- **Pass**: The `TodoList` component uses the `filter` prop to determine which todos to display. The `getFilteredTodos` function filters the todos based on the `filter` value, and the filtered todos are rendered in a list.

### Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
- **Pass**: The `TodoList` component includes a checkbox with the class `toggle-all` that, when changed, dispatches the `toggleAllTodos` action with the checked status.

### Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItem` component includes functionality to toggle the completion status (`handleToggle`), edit the title (`handleEdit`, `handleSubmit`, `handleKeyDown`, `handleBlur`), and delete the todo (`handleDestroy`).

### Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItem` component starts editing on double-click (`handleEdit`), submits the edited title on Enter key press (`handleKeyDown` with Enter key), and resets the title on Esc key press (`handleKeyDown` with Escape key).

### Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
- **Pass**: The `Footer` component displays the count of active items (`activeCount`), includes filter links (`NavLink` components), and has a button to clear completed items (`handleClearCompleted`).

### Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
- **Pass**: The `Footer` component includes a button with the class `clear-completed` that, when clicked, dispatches the `clearCompleted` action.
