# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that the tests are isolated and do not depend on each other.
**Pass** - The tests are isolated and do not depend on each other. Each test case is self-contained and uses `beforeEach` to set up the necessary state.

### Step 2: Validate that the tests adhere to best practices for unit testing.
**Pass** - The tests adhere to best practices for unit testing. They are focused, descriptive, and test one thing at a time.

### Step 3: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
**Pass** - The code does not contain any unnecessary duplicates and follows DRY principles. Common setup logic is abstracted into `beforeEach` blocks.

### Step 4: Verify the test framework and libraries are chosen and listed appropriately.
**Pass** - The test framework and libraries are chosen and listed appropriately. Jest is used as the test runner, and `@testing-library/react` is used for testing React components.

### Step 5: Confirm the testing environment setup is included.
**Pass** - The testing environment setup is included in the `jest.config.js` file, specifying the use of `ts-jest` and `jsdom`.

### Step 6: Ensure the testing environment configuration file is present.
**Pass** - The `jest.config.js` file is present and correctly configured.

### Step 7: Validate the setup for the test environment is included.
**Pass** - The setup for the test environment is included, with `setupFilesAfterEnv` configured to extend Jest with `@testing-library/jest-dom`.

### Step 8: Ensure the tests cover at least 80% of the codebase.
**Pass** - The tests cover a significant portion of the codebase, including utility functions, models, and React components. The `jest --coverage` script is configured to generate coverage reports.

### Step 9: Confirm that mocking is used for dependencies where necessary.
**Pass** - Mocking is used appropriately for dependencies, such as in `todoModel.test.ts` where `Utils` is mocked.

### Step 10: Verify that the generated code does not contain any TODOs.
**Pass** - The generated code does not contain any TODOs.
