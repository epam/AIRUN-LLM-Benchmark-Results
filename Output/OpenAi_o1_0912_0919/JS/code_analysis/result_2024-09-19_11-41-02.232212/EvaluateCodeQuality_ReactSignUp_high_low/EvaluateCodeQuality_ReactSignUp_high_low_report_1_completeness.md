## Readability

### 1. Use of Deprecated `PropTypes` Import
**Pass:** The `PropTypes` import is updated to import from the `prop-types` package.

### 2. Destructuring Props in Functional Components

### 2. Reusing Form Components
**Pass:** The `FormGroup` component is made more generic to improve reusability.

### 3. Simplifying Asynchronous Validation Logic
**Pass:** The `asyncValidate` function is refactored to use `async/await` for cleaner asynchronous code.

## Performance

### 1. Avoid Binding Functions Inside Render
**Pass:** Functions are bound in the constructor or use class property syntax to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

### 2. Removing Unnecessary `onClick` Handler on Submit Button
**Pass:** The redundant `onClick` handler on the submit button is removed.

### 3. Optimizing Async Validation Promises
**Pass:** The `asyncValidate` function is refactored to always return a Promise.

## Accessibility

### 1. Missing Labels for Inputs
**Pass:** Labels are added to inputs and associated using `id` and `htmlFor`.

### 2. Adding ARIA Attributes for Error Messages
**Pass:** ARIA attributes are included for error messages to improve accessibility.

### 3. Using Semantic HTML Elements
**Pass:** Appropriate semantic elements are used instead of generic `<div>` tags.

## Best Practices

### 1. Updating to Latest React and Library Versions
**Pass:** The code is updated to use the latest practices compatible with newer versions of React and related libraries.

### 2. Avoiding Use of `bindActionCreators` in Components
**Pass:** Action creators are bound using `connect` instead of `bindActionCreators` inside components.

### 3. Using `async/await` in Asynchronous Functions
**Pass:** `async/await` is used in asynchronous functions for better readability and maintainability.

### 4. Using Latest Redux Form Practices
**Pass:** The code is updated to use the latest `redux-form` practices, including `Field` components.

### 5. Avoiding Inline Styles and Classes
**Pass:** `react-bootstrap` components are used for styling instead of inline styles and classes.

## Testing

### 1. Adding Unit Tests for Validation Functions
**Pass:** Unit tests are added for the `validate` function.

### 2. Testing Components with Mocked Props
**Pass:** Tests are added to ensure the `Signup` component renders correctly and handles interactions.

## Documentation

### 1. Adding JSDoc Comments to Functions
**Pass:** JSDoc comments are added to functions to explain their purpose and usage.

### 2. Describing Components with Comments
**Pass:** Components are documented with comments to explain their purpose.

### 3. Documenting PropTypes and DefaultProps
