### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Confirm the component includes a search feature in the dropdown.**
   - **Pass**: The component filters options based on the `searchTerm` state, which is updated as the user types in the input field.

2. **Check that the component is navigable via keyboard.**
   - **Pass**: The component handles `ArrowDown`, `ArrowUp`, `Enter`, and `Escape` keys in the `handleInputKeyDown` function, allowing keyboard navigation.

3. **Verify items in the dropdown can be selected by pressing the Enter key.**
   - **Pass**: The `handleInputKeyDown` function includes logic to select the focused option when the `Enter` key is pressed.

4. **Confirm the dropdown list opens when Enter is pressed.**
   - **Pass**: The `handleInputKeyDown` function sets `isOpen` to `true` when the `Enter` key is pressed and the dropdown is not already open.

5. **Ensure the focus returns to the select component after the dropdown is closed.**
   - **Pass**: The `selectOption` function and the `Escape` key handler both call `inputRef.current?.focus()` to return focus to the input field.

6. **Verify the dropdown closes upon selecting an item via keyboard.**
   - **Pass**: The `selectOption` function sets `isOpen` to `false`, closing the dropdown when an item is selected via keyboard.

7. **Verify the dropdown closes upon selecting an item via mouse.**
   - **Pass**: The `selectOption` function is called in the `onClick` handler of each option, closing the dropdown when an item is selected via mouse.

8. **Confirm the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed.**
   - **Pass**: The `handleInputKeyDown` function sets `isOpen` to `false` when the `Escape` key is pressed.

9. **Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component.**
   - **Pass**: The `handleClickOutside` function, added as an event listener in the `useEffect` hook, sets `isOpen` to `false` when clicking outside the component.
