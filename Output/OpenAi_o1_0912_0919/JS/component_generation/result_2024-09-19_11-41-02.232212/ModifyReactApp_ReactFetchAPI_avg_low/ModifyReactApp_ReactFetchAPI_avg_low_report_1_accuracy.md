# Evaluation Report

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.**
   - **Pass**: All imports (`React`, `useEffect`, `useState`, `axios`) are used in the code.

2. **Ensure the codebase is structured and follows React best practices (state, hooks, effects).**
   - **Pass**: The code uses `useState` for state management and `useEffect` for side effects, following React best practices.

3. **Check that a debounced function is used to optimize the search requests.**
   - **Pass**: The code uses `setTimeout` to debounce the search requests, which is a valid approach.

4. **Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.**
   - **Pass**: The `useEffect` cleanup function cancels the axios request and clears the timeout, preventing memory leaks.

5. **Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.**
   - **Pass**: The code uses modern React hooks and TypeScript, ensuring compatibility with the latest versions.

6. **Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.**
   - **Pass**: The code includes error handling for axios requests, preventing unhandled promise rejections.

7. **Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.**
   - **Pass**: The code uses React's state (`query`) to manage the input value.

8. **Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React’s virtual DOM.**
   - **Pass**: The code does not directly manipulate the DOM.

9. **Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React’s state and props.**
   - **Pass**: The code does not use refs for DOM access.

10. **Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.**
    - **Pass**: The code is concise and does not contain any duplicate logic.

11. **Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.**
    - **Pass**: The `useEffect` dependency array is correctly set to `[query]`, preventing unnecessary re-renders.

12. **Confirm that the useState is used to capture the search input value.**
    - **Pass**: The `useState` hook is used to capture and manage the search input value (`query`).

13. **Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs.**
    - **Pass**: The code does not contain any TODO comments.

14. **Verify the inclusion of TypeScript in the React application.**
    - **Pass**: The code uses TypeScript interfaces and types.

15. **Ensure that `axios` is used for making API requests.**
    - **Pass**: The code uses `axios` for making API requests.

16. **Validate that the `useEffect` hooks are used correctly for data loading.**
    - **Pass**: The `useEffect` hook is correctly used for data loading and cleanup.
