# Evaluation Report

## Steps

### Step 1: Check that the main component displays the header with input for new todos.
- **Pass**: The `app.component.html` contains a header with an input field for new todos.

### Step 2: Ensure that adding a new todo item works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `handleNewTodoKeyDown` method in `app.component.ts` dispatches the `addTodo` action when the Enter key is pressed, and the reducer handles this action to add a new todo.

### Step 3: Verify that the todo list displays all added todo items.
- **Pass**: The `app.component.html` uses `*ngFor` to iterate over `todos$` and display each todo item using the `app-todo-item` component.

### Step 4: Confirm that toggle functionality works for marking todos as completed.
- **Pass**: The `handleToggle` method in `todo-item.component.ts` dispatches the `toggleTodo` action, and the reducer updates the todo's completed status.

### Step 5: Check that editing a todo item works and updates the todo item correctly.
- **Pass**: The `handleSubmit` method in `todo-item.component.ts` dispatches the `editTodo` action, and the reducer updates the todo's title.

### Step 6: Ensure that deleting a todo item removes it from the list.
- **Pass**: The `handleDestroy` method in `todo-item.component.ts` dispatches the `deleteTodo` action, and the reducer removes the todo from the list.

### Step 7: Verify that the footer correctly displays the count of active items.
- **Pass**: The `todo-footer.component.html` displays the count of active items using the `activeTodoCount` getter in `todo-footer.component.ts`.

### Step 8: Confirm that the footer's clear completed button works and removes completed items.
- **Pass**: The `handleClearCompleted` method in `todo-footer.component.ts` emits the `clearCompleted` event, which is handled in `app.component.ts` to dispatch the `clearCompleted` action, and the reducer removes completed todos.

### Step 9: Check that filtering todos by "all", "active", and "completed" works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `ngOnInit` method in `app.component.ts` subscribes to route changes and updates the `todos$` observable to filter todos based on the current route.

### Step 10: Ensure that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `toggleAll` method in `app.component.ts` dispatches the `toggleAllTodos` action, and the reducer updates the completed status of all todos.

### Step 11: Check that the application persists todos to local storage and reloads them correctly.
- **Pass**: The `Utils.store` method handles storing and retrieving todos from local storage, and the initial state in `todo.reducer.ts` loads todos from local storage.
