### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.**
   - **Pass**: All imports in the provided code are used appropriately.

2. **Ensure the codebase is structured and follows React best practices (state, hooks, effects).**
   - **Pass**: The codebase is well-structured, using functional components, hooks (useState, useEffect), and follows React best practices.

3. **Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.**
   - **Pass**: The useEffect cleanup functions are correctly implemented to remove event listeners, preventing memory leaks.

4. **Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.**
   - **Pass**: The code uses modern React (functional components, hooks) and TypeScript features, ensuring compatibility with the latest versions.

5. **Verify the application works correctly across modern browsers.**
   - **Pass**: The code does not contain any browser-specific features that would limit compatibility with modern browsers.

6. **Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.**
   - **Pass**: The provided code does not contain any obvious issues that would result in console errors or warnings.

7. **Verify that the new React app initializes successfully without errors.**
   - **Pass**: The initialization code in `src/index.tsx` is correct and should initialize the app without errors.

8. **Verify that the codebase does not contain any TODOs.**
   - **Pass**: The codebase does not contain any TODO comments.

9. **Ensure the application has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.**
   - **Pass**: The React components and their structure match the original HTML structure.

10. **Verify the application UI matches the original HTML structure visually.**
    - **Pass**: The React components and their CSS classes should render the UI to match the original HTML structure visually.

11. **Verify the application handles rapid sequential key presses without audio overlap issues.**
    - **Pass**: The `playNote` function ensures that the audio is played from the start, preventing overlap issues.
