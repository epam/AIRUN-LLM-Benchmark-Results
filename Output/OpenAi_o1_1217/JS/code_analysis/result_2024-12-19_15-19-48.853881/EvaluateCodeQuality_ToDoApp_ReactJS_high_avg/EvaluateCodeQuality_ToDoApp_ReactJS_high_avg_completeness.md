# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### 1. Ensure the use of `let` or `const` instead of `var`.
**Pass**  
The provided code examples use `const` and `let` instead of `var`.

### 2. Verify that `refs` are replaced with React state and props for DOM manipulation.
**Pass**  
The code review suggests replacing legacy string refs with `React.createRef()`, which is a modern and recommended approach.

### 3. Confirm that variable and function names are descriptive and meaningful.
**Pass**  
Variable and function names such as `newFieldRef`, `handleNewTodoKeyDown`, and `toggle` are descriptive and meaningful.

### 4. Look for consistent use of whitespace and indentation.
**Pass**  
The code examples provided show consistent use of whitespace and indentation.

### 5. Ensure large methods are broken down into smaller, more manageable methods.
**Pass**  
The review suggests breaking down inline event handlers into separate class methods, which helps in managing large methods.

### 6. Verify that inline event handlers are moved to class methods.
**Pass**  
The review includes examples where inline event handlers are moved to class methods, improving readability and maintainability.

### 7. Check for modular code structure with reusable components and functions.
**Pass**  
The review suggests modularizing utility functions into separate files, promoting a modular code structure.

### 8. Confirm the use of TypeScript interfaces and types for better type safety.
**Pass**  
The review includes TypeScript interfaces and types, ensuring better type safety.

### 9. Check for the elimination of inefficient DOM manipulation methods like `ReactDOM.findDOMNode`.
**Pass**  
There is no mention or use of `ReactDOM.findDOMNode` in the provided code examples.

### 10. Ensure that performance enhancements like `shouldComponentUpdate` are correctly implemented.
**Pass**  
The review suggests using `React.memo` for functional components and `PureComponent` for class components to optimize performance.

### 11. Verify that unnecessary re-renders are minimized by using appropriate React lifecycle methods.
**Pass**  
The review includes suggestions to avoid binding in JSX and to use `React.memo` or `PureComponent` to minimize unnecessary re-renders.

### 12. Ensure the addition of ARIA attributes to improve accessibility.
**Pass**  
The review suggests adding ARIA attributes like `aria-label` to improve accessibility.

### 13. Verify that all interactive elements have accessible names and roles.
**Pass**  
The review includes examples where interactive elements are given accessible names and roles, such as using `aria-label`.

### 14. Check for proper use of semantic HTML elements.
**Pass**  
The review suggests using proper labels for inputs, which is part of using semantic HTML elements.
