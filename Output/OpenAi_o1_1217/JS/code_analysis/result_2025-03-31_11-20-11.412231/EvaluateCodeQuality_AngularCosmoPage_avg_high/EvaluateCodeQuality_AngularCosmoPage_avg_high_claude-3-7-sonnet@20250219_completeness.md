- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the pageCtrl.js controller is thoroughly analyzed for code complexity and size issues

    The pageCtrl.js controller is thoroughly analyzed for code complexity and size issues. Issue 1.1 specifically addresses the "Large Monolithic Functions in Controller" with detailed recommendations for breaking down the savePage function into smaller, more focused functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure HTML template is evaluated for proper binding and structural organization

    The answer evaluates the HTML template for proper binding, specifically pointing out issues like the typo in "ng-modal" attributes that should be "ng-model" in Issue 1.3.

    The answer does not include a specific assessment of error handling patterns throughout the codebase. There is no mention of try/catch blocks, error callbacks, or other error handling mechanisms.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm data flow and component communication patterns are evaluated

    The answer does not specifically evaluate data flow and component communication patterns. While it mentions moving functionality to services, it doesn't analyze how components currently communicate with each other.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure localStorage usage is analyzed for potential issues

    The answer analyzes localStorage usage for potential issues in Issue 3.1 "Repeated LocalStorage Operations" and provides recommendations for debouncing localStorage writes to improve performance.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify form handling and validation approaches are assessed

    The answer does not include a specific assessment of form handling and validation approaches. While it mentions form fields in the accessibility section, it doesn't analyze how form validation is implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm callback nesting and promise handling are evaluated for maintainability
