# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation includes a comprehensive component overview explaining the purpose and architecture  
  The documentation begins with an "INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW" section and continues with an "ARCHITECTURAL ROLE" section, clearly explaining the overall purpose and how each component fits into the system.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all major components (REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and Page controller) are documented  
  Each of these major components is individually described, detailing their functionality and role within the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure all significant features of the page management system are described  
  The documentation covers detailed features such as CRUD operations, local draft management, revisioning/versioning, scheduling, duplication, and deletion of pages.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all form inputs and their behavior are documented  
  The "page.html" section describes the UI elements including title, description, URL, tags, and publishing schedules with the use of AngularJS directives ensuring proper documentation of form inputs and their bindings.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page versioning and revision system  
  The answer explains how local drafts are managed, how page revisions are created, and describes functions (like localVersion and deleteNewerVersion) specifically intended for versioning.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation covers the tag system and autocomplete functionality  
  It explicitly documents functions such as autocompleteTags and selectSuggestion, as well as their use in the UI for offering tag suggestions.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure the documentation includes explanation of error handling and user notifications  
  While the documentation mentions abnormal cases in the scheduling logic and deletion processes, it does not provide detailed information on how errors are handled or how notifications are communicated to the user. This gap leads to a failure in fully addressing this step.  
  *Explanation: The documentation lacks dedicated sections or detailed examples on error handling mechanisms and user notification patterns, which are important aspects of robust application design.*

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page publishing workflow including scheduling  
  The answer clearly distinguishes between immediate publishing and scheduled publishing dates, detailing the related logic and handling within the pageCtrl.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation details how content extras and additional metadata are managed  
  The documentation includes detailed descriptions in the interface specifications (e.g., fields like extras and misc) and explains their roles in managing additional data.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation explains how the UI interacts with the backend APIs  
  There is a clear explanation of how the AngularJS components (particularly in the usage documentation) interact with the RESTful endpoints via the REST factory and the $resource service.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes sample usage examples or patterns  
  The usage documentation provides code examples, including a sample controller that demonstrates how to use the REST, Page, and Users factories, ensuring practical patterns are included.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains all significant event broadcasting and inter-component communication  
  The document explicitly mentions the use of $rootScope.$broadcast and $scope.$on for event broadcasting, along with the custom events like 'contentGet' and 'settingsGet', clearly explaining the communication between components.
