  The overview section clearly describes the Todo App and each component’s role with sufficient detail.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all props are documented with their names, types, and descriptions  
  The documentation uses tables for TodoApp, TodoItem, and TodoFooter that list each prop’s name, type, and purpose.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation clearly distinguishes between required and optional props  
  The tables explicitly mark props as “(Required)” where needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component's state management approach is accurately documented  
  The state for components like TodoApp and TodoItem is clearly explained, including the properties stored and their purposes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that sample code snippets demonstrate proper implementation of the components  
  The “USAGE INSTRUCTIONS” section provides sample code that shows how to instantiate the TodoModel and render TodoApp, illustrating proper integration.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation explains all ARIA roles and attributes implemented in the components  
  Although the documentation notes that no explicit ARIA roles were added, it explains the use of semantic HTML and mentions accessibility aspects, which meets the evaluation criteria.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation describes how the components support assistive technologies  
  The “ACCESSIBILITY FEATURES” section details semantic HTML elements, labels, and keyboard navigation that support assistive technologies.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that keyboard navigation support and focus management are explained in the documentation  
  The documentation explicitly explains keyboard interactions (e.g., Enter and Escape keys) and focus management (auto-focusing the edit input), fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that performance optimizations like shouldComponentUpdate are documented with explanations  
  The documentation describes the use of shouldComponentUpdate in TodoItem and explains how it improves performance in large lists.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that component lifecycle methods are explained with their purposes  
  Lifecycle methods such as componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate are detailed along with their roles in managing component behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that any dependencies or requirements are noted in the documentation  
  The “USAGE INSTRUCTIONS” section lists necessary dependencies (React, ReactDOM, etc.) and provides installation guidelines.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation uses clear section headings and consistent formatting  
  The document is organized with clear headings like "OVERVIEW," "COMPONENT STRUCTURE & INTERFACES," "USAGE INSTRUCTIONS," etc., ensuring clarity and consistency.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that tables are used for structured data like props  
  Tables are used effectively to present prop information for the components.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all technical terms are used accurately throughout the documentation  
  Technical terms such as “immutable,” “localStorage,” and “component lifecycle” are used correctly, reflecting an accurate understanding of React principles.
