# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Confirm the component includes a search feature in the dropdown.
**Pass**: The component includes an input field (`searchInputRef`) within the dropdown for searching items.

### Step 2: Check that the component is navigable via keyboard.
**Pass**: The component handles keyboard events (`handleKeyDown`) for navigation using Arrow keys, Enter, and Escape.

### Step 3: Verify items in the dropdown can be selected by pressing the Enter key.
**Pass**: The `handleKeyDown` function includes logic to select an item when the Enter key is pressed.

### Step 4: Confirm the dropdown list opens when Enter is pressed.
**Pass**: The `handleKeyDown` function includes logic to open the dropdown when the Enter key is pressed and the dropdown is not already open.

### Step 5: Ensure the focus returns to the select component after the dropdown is closed.
**Pass**: The `useEffect` hook ensures that the focus returns to the toggle button (`toggleButtonRef`) when the dropdown is closed.

### Step 6: Verify the dropdown closes upon selecting an item via keyboard.
**Pass**: The `selectItem` function sets `isOpen` to `false`, closing the dropdown upon item selection.

### Step 7: Verify the dropdown closes upon selecting an item via mouse.
**Pass**: The `handleItemClick` function calls `selectItem`, which closes the dropdown upon item selection.

### Step 8: Confirm the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed.
**Pass**: The `handleKeyDown` function includes logic to close the dropdown when the Escape key is pressed.

### Step 9: Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component.
**Pass**: The `useEffect` hook includes an event listener (`handleClickOutside`) that closes the dropdown when clicking outside the component.
