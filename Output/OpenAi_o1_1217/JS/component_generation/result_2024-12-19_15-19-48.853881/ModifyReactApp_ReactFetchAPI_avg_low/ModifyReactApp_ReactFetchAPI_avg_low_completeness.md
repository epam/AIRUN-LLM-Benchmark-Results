# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that a loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass**: The code sets `loading` to `true` before making the API request and displays "Loading..." when `loading` is `true`.

### Step 2: Verify that the loader does not hide the search input when data is loading.
**Pass**: The search input is always visible regardless of the loading state.

### Step 3: Validate that a request with an empty search term is sent on the initial render.
**Pass**: On initial render, `searchTerm` is an empty string, and the API request is made with `searchTerm` as a query parameter.

### Step 4: Verify that the search input field is present.
**Pass**: The search input field is present in the JSX with the placeholder "Search characters...".

### Step 5: Ensure that the character search functionality is implemented.
**Pass**: The search functionality is implemented by updating `searchTerm` state on input change and making an API request with the updated `searchTerm`.

### Step 6: Ensure that the API request includes the search term as a query parameter.
**Pass**: The API request URL includes `searchTerm` as a query parameter.

### Step 7: Validate that the data is loading on initial app load with empty query and then when the search term changes.
**Pass**: The data is fetched on initial load with an empty query and whenever `searchTerm` changes.

### Step 8: Ensure that the debounced fetch function prevents unnecessary API requests.
**Pass**: The use of `setTimeout` with a 500ms delay and `clearTimeout` ensures that the API request is debounced.

### Step 9: Confirm that the character list is updated based on the search results.
**Pass**: The character list is updated based on the search results by setting `characters` state with the API response data.

### Step 10: Validate that the application handles API request errors.
**Pass**: The application handles API request errors by logging them to the console.

### Step 11: Ensure that the user experience remains smooth without backend overloads.
**Pass**: The debounced fetch function and loading indicator ensure a smooth user experience without overloading the backend.
