# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x
  
  The component imports from React and uses hooks like useState, useEffect, and useRef that are compatible with React 18. It also uses the FC (FunctionComponent) type from React which is consistent with React 18 usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
  
  The code is properly typed with TypeScript. It includes interfaces for Option and SearchableSelectProps, properly types event handlers (KeyboardEvent, FocusEvent, ChangeEvent), and uses type annotations for refs (useRef<HTMLDivElement>).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling
  
  The solution includes a detailed index.css file with appropriate styling for all the component parts, and the component imports this CSS file.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments
  
  The code is clean, well-structured, and contains no TODO comments or debugging artifacts. All functions and variables have descriptive names, and the code follows a logical organization.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility
  
  The component properly manages state using React hooks for all necessary variables:
  - `isOpen` for dropdown visibility
  - `searchTerm` for the search input
  - `highlightedIndex` for keyboard navigation
  - `selectedValue` for tracking the selected option

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props
  
  The component accepts the following props, making it highly reusable:
  - `label` (optional)
  - `options` (required)
  - `onChange` (required)
  - `placeholder` (optional with default)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection
  
  The component properly implements keyboard navigation with handlers for:
  - Arrow up/down for navigating options
  - Enter for selecting an option
  - Escape for closing the dropdown
  - Space for toggling the dropdown

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions
  
  The component uses useRef appropriately for DOM interactions, properly focuses elements when needed, and follows React best practices for DOM manipulation using refs instead of direct DOM access.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques
  
  The component properly manages focus:
  - When opening the dropdown, focus moves to the search input
  - When closing, focus returns to the main button/container
  - It handles click outside scenarios to close the dropdown

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
  
  The component includes appropriate ARIA attributes:
  - `role="button"` for the container
  - `aria-haspopup="listbox"` indicates a popup list
  - `aria-expanded` for dropdown state
  - `aria-label` for screen readers
  - `role="listbox"` for the dropdown
  - `role="option"` for options
  - `aria-selected` for the currently highlighted option

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  There are no console.log, console.error, or other debugging statements in the code that would cause warnings or errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component
  
  The component uses appropriate dependency arrays in useEffect hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders. State changes are properly isolated, and effects only run when their dependencies change.
