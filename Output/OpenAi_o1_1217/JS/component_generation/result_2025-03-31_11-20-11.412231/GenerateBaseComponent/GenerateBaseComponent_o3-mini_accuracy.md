# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  Although the implementation does not explicitly mention React 18 (for example, by using createRoot), the code is written using modern React practices (hooks, functional components) that are fully supported by React 18. I am 100% confident that there is nothing in the code that contradicts its use with React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  The code defines TypeScript interfaces for props and options, uses React.FC with explicit type parameters, and annotates refs and events. This indicates proper use of TypeScript throughout the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  The implementation clearly cites an external "index.css" file and provides a detailed CSS example for styling the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  The provided code is well-organized, properly commented for clarity, and does not contain any leftover TODO comments.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  The component employs useState to manage states such as dropdown open/closed status, the selected value, and the search term, which is a standard and proper approach.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  The component accepts props like label, options, onChange, and placeholder, making it generic and reusable in various contexts.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  Keyboard interactions are effectively managed (e.g., handling Enter, Space, ArrowUp, ArrowDown, and Escape keys) to provide a robust and accessible user experience.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  The usage of useRef for managing the container element and the search input, combined with event listeners for clicks outside the component, shows adherence to best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  The component actively manages focus by shifting to the input when the dropdown opens and returning focus to the container when it closes, ensuring smooth navigation for keyboard users.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  ARIA attributes such as role, aria-haspopup, aria-expanded, and aria-label (as well as appropriate roles and aria-selected on list options) are correctly used to enhance accessibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  Based on a static review, the component is well-structured and follows current standards. There are no obvious coding issues that would lead to console errors or warnings.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  While the component recalculates the filtered options during each render, this pattern is acceptable in most cases (especially when the number of options is small). However, in scenarios with a very large list of options, optimization (e.g., memoization) might be beneficial. I am 90% confident that, for typical use cases, the implementation does not introduce unnecessary re-renders.
