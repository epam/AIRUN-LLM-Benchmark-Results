# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The implementation conditionally renders a div with the class "searchable-select-dropdown" when the component’s state (isOpen) is true, which represents the dropdown select UI element.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  The component renders an input element (with type "text" and class "searchable-select-input") inside the dropdown for real-time filtering.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The component maintains a state (selectedValue) and calls the provided onChange callback when an option is selected, ensuring single selection functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The implementation listens for “ArrowDown” and “ArrowUp” key events in the handleKeyDownList function, which navigates through available options by updating the highlightedIndex.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  When the Enter key is pressed while navigating the list (and the highlightedIndex is valid), the component calls a function to select that option, confirming this functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  The container’s onKeyDown handler detects the Enter key press and toggles the dropdown visibility through the handleToggleDropdown function.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  The closeDropdown function explicitly sets focus back to the containerRef, ensuring that focus returns to the select component once the dropdown is closed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  Each option list item is rendered with an onMouseDown event that triggers handleSelectOption, which in turn calls closeDropdown to close the dropdown after a mouse selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  When an item is selected using the Enter key (while navigating with the keyboard), the handleKeyDownList function calls handleSelectOption, causing the dropdown to close.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  The onKeyDown handler for the search input listens for the "Escape" key and calls closeDropdown, correctly closing the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  A useEffect hook adds an event listener for mousedown events, and if the click occurs outside the component, closeDropdown is invoked.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  The container’s onKeyDown handler captures the Enter key press to toggle the dropdown (via handleToggleDropdown), making sure the dropdown opens as expected.
