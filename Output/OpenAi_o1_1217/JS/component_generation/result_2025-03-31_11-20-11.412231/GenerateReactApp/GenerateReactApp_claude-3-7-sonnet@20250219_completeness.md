# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The application uses axios to fetch character data from the SWAPI endpoint (`https://swapi.dev/api/people`) and maps through the results to display each character's name in a list.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The application implements a loading state that is set to true before the API request and false after it completes. A loading indicator is displayed with the code: `if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;`

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The code maps through all characters received from the API response and renders each one in a list item: `{characters.map(character => (<li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>))}`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  The code does not contain any search functionality, filters, or user input fields. It only displays the characters fetched from the API.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character's name is correctly displayed in a list item: `<li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The package.json includes "react-scripts" which is the build tool used by Create React App, and the scripts section contains the standard CRA commands (start, build, test).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The application properly manages state for:
  - Loading: `const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(false);`
  - Error handling: `const [error, setError] = useState<string>('');`
  - Character data: `const [characters, setCharacters] = useState<Character[]>([]);`

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each character list item has a unique key using the character's URL: `<li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  If the data fetch is unsuccessful, the application shows an error message. If the data is being loaded, a loading message is displayed. The application doesn't explicitly handle the case where the API returns an empty array, but the mapping would simply not render any list items, which is appropriate behavior.
