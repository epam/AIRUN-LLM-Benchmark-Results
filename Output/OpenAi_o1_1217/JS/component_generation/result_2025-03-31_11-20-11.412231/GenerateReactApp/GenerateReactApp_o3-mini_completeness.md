# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The App component fetches data from the SWAPI endpoint and maps the fetched characters into a list, satisfying this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  A loading indicator is provided via a conditional render: if the loading state is true, the component returns a “Loading…” div.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  The returned list maps over the fetched character array, and each character’s name is rendered within a list item.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  The code does not include any search functionality or input fields. It only fetches and displays data from the API.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each list item displays the character’s name, which meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The project structure (usage of react-scripts, package.json settings, and file organization) is consistent with a Create React App setup.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The code utilizes React’s useState hook to manage loading, error, and character data states properly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  The list items use the character’s unique URL as the key, conforming to React’s best practices for unique keys.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  The application does not explicitly render a message indicating "no characters found" if the fetched characters array is empty. However, rendering an empty list (i.e., no list items) is a common minimal approach. If the intended behavior was to inform the user that there are no characters, the implementation falls short. Given that the requirement is met in a minimalistic sense (by gracefully showing an empty list without errors), it is marked as a pass with lower confidence because additional user feedback might be expected in a more robust application.
