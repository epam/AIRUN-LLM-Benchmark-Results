# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type
  
  The code correctly implements a search input field that updates the `searchTerm` state using the `handleSearchChange` callback function.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls
  
  The implementation includes a debouncing pattern with a 500ms delay, using `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout` with a `debounceTimerRef` to manage the timer.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured
  
  Axios is correctly imported and used for API requests with proper configuration for the Star Wars API endpoint.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses
  
  The code includes TypeScript interfaces for `Character` and `SwapiResponse`, and all components, functions, state variables, and event handlers are properly typed.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters
  
  The API endpoint is correctly constructed with the search parameter: `https://swapi.dev/api/people/?search=${query}`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate
  
  The code uses `useCallback` for both the `fetchCharacters` function and the `handleSearchChange` function, which is appropriate for these functions that are dependencies in the effect hook.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback
  
  Error handling is properly implemented with try/catch/finally blocks, setting an error state, and displaying error messages to the user when API requests fail.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing
  
  The debounce implementation ensures that API calls are only triggered after the user stops typing for 500ms.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices
  
  The code follows React best practices for state management, using separate state variables for characters, search term, loading state, and error state.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code
  
  The code does not contain any console.log statements, unused imports, or commented-out code. It's clean and well-organized.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests
  
  Loading state is properly managed with the `setLoading` state setter, setting to true before API calls and to false after they complete, with appropriate UI feedback.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns
  
  The code uses React 18.x patterns, including the new `ReactDOM.createRoot` API for rendering the app.
