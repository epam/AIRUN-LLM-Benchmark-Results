# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type  
  The code implements an input element with an onChange handler (handleSearchChange) that updates the searchTerm state using event.target.value.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls  
  A debounce timer using setTimeout with a 500ms delay is correctly implemented. The timer is also cleared on component unmount or re-render.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured  
  Axios is used in the fetchCharacters function to perform the GET request to the SWAPI endpoint with TypeScript generics for response typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses  
  The code defines interfaces for Character and SwapiResponse, and function components and event handlers are typed correctly using TypeScript annotations.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters  
  The endpoint URL is dynamically constructed by appending the search query parameter (?search=â€¦) ensuring that the user-provided searchTerm is included.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate  
  The implementation makes use of useCallback to memoize both the fetchCharacters function and the search change handler, optimizing performance.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback  
  A try-catch block in fetchCharacters captures errors and sets an error state that is subsequently displayed in red text to the user.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing  
  The debounce implementation ensures that the API call (fetchCharacters) is triggered 500ms after the user stops typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices  
  The use of useState for managing searchTerm, characters, loading, and error demonstrates adherence to React state management best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code  
  The code is clean with all imports being used appropriately and without any commented-out code or extraneous console errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests  
  The loading state is set to true before the fetch and handled appropriately in the finally block after API calls, ensuring proper loading indication.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns  
  The code employs React 18.x patterns by using ReactDOM.createRoot and functional components with hooks.
