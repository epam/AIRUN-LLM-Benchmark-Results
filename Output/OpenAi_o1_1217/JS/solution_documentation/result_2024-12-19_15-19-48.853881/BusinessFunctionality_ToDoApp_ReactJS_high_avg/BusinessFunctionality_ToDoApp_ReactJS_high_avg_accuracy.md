# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### 1. Confirm that constraints related to local storage limitations are noted.
**Pass**  
The analysis mentions that the application relies on localStorage for persistence and notes that data will be lost if a user clears their browser data or switches to a different device.

### 2. Verify that assumptions about the application being designed for a single user are mentioned.
**Pass**  
The analysis clearly states that there is no user authentication or multi-user collaboration, and all todos belong to a single local user.

### 3. Ensure that browser compatibility assumptions are included.
**Fail**  
The analysis does not explicitly mention any assumptions or considerations regarding browser compatibility.

### 4. Check that performance-related constraints are noted.
**Pass**  
The analysis discusses performance-related constraints, such as the use of immutable updates and the shouldComponentUpdate check in the TodoItem component.

### 5. Confirm that performance optimizations, such as the use of `shouldComponentUpdate`, are identified.
**Pass**  
The analysis identifies the use of shouldComponentUpdate in the TodoItem component as a performance optimization.

### 6. Verify that considerations for using immutable data structures for performance are mentioned.
**Pass**  
The analysis mentions the use of map() and filter() to create new arrays rather than mutating existing data, adhering to Reactâ€™s recommended best practices.

### 7. Ensure scalability considerations related to local storage limitations are discussed.
**Pass**  
The analysis discusses that the app is designed primarily for small sets of todos stored locally and mentions the need for backend solutions or database integration for very large datasets or multiple users.

### 8. Check that the potential need for a backend service for better scalability is mentioned.
**Pass**  
The analysis mentions that for very large datasets or multiple users, the application would need backend solutions, database integration, or pagination.

### 9. Confirm that the evaluation steps are unambiguous and concise.
**Pass**  
The evaluation steps are clear and concise, allowing the evaluator to assess the output based solely on the provided code.

### 10. Ensure that each step allows the evaluator to assess the output based solely on the provided code.
**Pass**  
Each step is designed to allow the evaluator to assess the output based on the provided analysis of the code.

### 11. Verify that the steps are clearly articulated and cover all main points of the task.
**Pass**  
The steps are clearly articulated and cover all the main points of the task, including functionality, user interactions, business objectives, constraints/assumptions, and performance/scalability.
