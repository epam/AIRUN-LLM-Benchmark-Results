- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of local storage for data persistence

    The document correctly identifies localStorage use for data persistence in multiple sections, particularly in section 1.2 where it mentions "The TodoModel class is in charge of reading from and writing to localStorage."

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the state management approach using the TodoModel

    The document accurately describes the state management approach in section 1.3 State Management Approach, explaining how TodoModel holds the source of truth and updates localStorage before calling .inform() to trigger re-rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the routing mechanism for filtering todos
