# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers all main functionality including adding, editing, deleting, and toggling todos

    The document clearly covers all main functionality. In section 1.1, it lists the core features including creating, toggling, editing, and deleting todos. It further elaborates on these in section 2.1 under "User Interaction Patterns" with detailed explanations of how each function works.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about filtering todos by status (all, active, completed)

    The document thoroughly covers the filtering functionality. It's mentioned in section 1.2 (Core Components), specifically noting the TodoFooter component's role. It's detailed again in section 2.1 under "Filtering Todos" where it explains how users can click "All", "Active", or "Completed" links to filter todos, and how routing logic updates the state.nowShowing property accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the user workflow for creating new todo items

    The document clearly describes the workflow for creating new todo items in section 2.1 under "Creating Todos". It explains that users type into the "What needs to be done?" input and press Enter, which triggers the handleNewTodoKeyDown function in TodoApp to add a new todo to the model.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the editing functionality triggered by double-clicking

    The document thoroughly covers the editing functionality in section 2.1 under "Editing Todos". It explicitly states that double-clicking a TodoItem label begins editing, and explains how users can modify the title, save with Enter or by focusing away, and cancel edits with Escape.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the clear completed functionality

    The document includes clear information about the clear completed functionality in section 2.1 under "Clearing Completed Todos". It states that the "Clear completed" button in the footer removes all completed todos at once.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the document describes the toggle all functionality

    The document does not specifically describe a "toggle all" functionality in detail. While it mentions "toggleAll" in section 6A under "Functional Areas", it doesn't explain what this function does or how users interact with it. There is no mention of a toggle all checkbox or button in the user interaction sections.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the counter for remaining items

    The document covers the counter functionality in section 2.1, noting that the TodoFooter "displays the count of active items" and in section 2.2 stating "As they mark items complete, the count of active items goes down". Further confirmation is in section 6A where it mentions "Filtering & Counting: switch statement in render (app.tsx), plus TodoFooter for display".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the persistent storage of todos

    The document thoroughly covers the persistent storage of todos. In section 1.2, it explains that the TodoModel manages persisting data via localStorage. In section 1.3, it mentions that the model updates localStorage on todo modifications. In section 2.3, it explicitly states "Persistent data: The todos persist in localStorage, meaning a user can refresh the page and retain their list." Section 6A also references "Persistence: localStorage via Utils.store in todoModel".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the UI components and their relationships

    The document thoroughly describes UI components and their relationships in section 1.2 "Core Components and Their Relationships". It lists each component (TodoApp, TodoItem, TodoFooter, TodoModel, Constants, Utils) with their functions and explains the data flow between components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the business objectives addressed by the application

    The document covers business objectives in section 3 "Business Objectives", outlining primary goals (quick task management, intuitive UI), secondary objectives (demonstrating React patterns, multi-device usage), and technical implementation alignments.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes performance and scalability considerations

    The document includes a dedicated section (5) on "Performance & Scalability Considerations". It covers performance optimizations (like shouldComponentUpdate), scalability approaches and limitations (localStorage limitations), and efficiency patterns (use of array methods, React's diffing algorithm).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes technical constraints and limitations

    The document clearly describes technical constraints and limitations in section
