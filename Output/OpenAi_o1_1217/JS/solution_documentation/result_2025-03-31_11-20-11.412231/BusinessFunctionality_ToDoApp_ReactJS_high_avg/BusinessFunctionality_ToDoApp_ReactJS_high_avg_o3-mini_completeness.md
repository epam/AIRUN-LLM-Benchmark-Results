  Filtering is well described, with explicit reference to the “All”, “Active”, and “Completed” filters and the corresponding routing logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the user workflow for creating new todo items  
  The workflow for creating new todos is described in the “Creating Todos” section under User Interaction Patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the editing functionality triggered by double-clicking  
  The document explains that double-clicking a TodoItem initiates editing and details the subsequent behavior (saving on Enter or blur, cancelling on Escape).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the clear completed functionality  
  The “Clearing Completed Todos” section details the clear completed button behavior in the footer.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the toggle all functionality  
  The document references “toggleAll” and explains how toggling affects the overall list, ensuring the functionality is covered.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the counter for remaining items  
  The document details that the TodoFooter displays the count of active items, confirming the presence of a counter.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the persistent storage of todos  
  Persistence through localStorage is mentioned several times, particularly in the explanation of the TodoModel and Utils modules.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the UI components and their relationships  
  A detailed breakdown is provided, clearly listing components like TodoApp, TodoItem, TodoFooter, TodoModel, Constants, and Utils along with their interactions.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the document covers the pluralization of item/items text based on count
