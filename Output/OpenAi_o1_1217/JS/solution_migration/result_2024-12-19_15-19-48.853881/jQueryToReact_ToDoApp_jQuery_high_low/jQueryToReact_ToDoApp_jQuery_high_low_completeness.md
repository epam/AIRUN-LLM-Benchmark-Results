# Evaluation Report

## Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
- **Pass**: The `Header` component contains an input field with the class `new-todo`. The `handleKeyDown` function listens for the Enter key press and dispatches the `addTodo` action with the current state value.

## Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
- **Pass**: The `TodoList` component uses the `filteredTodos` function to filter the list of todos based on the current filter state and displays the filtered todos.

## Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
- **Pass**: The `MainSection` component contains a checkbox with the class `toggle-all` that dispatches the `toggleAll` action when changed.

## Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItem` component includes functionality to toggle (`handleToggle`), edit (`handleDoubleClick`, `handleChange`, `handleKeyDown`, `handleBlur`, `handleSubmit`), and delete (`handleDestroy`) a todo item.

## Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItem` component starts editing on double click (`handleDoubleClick`), submits on Enter key press (`handleKeyDown`), and resets on Esc key press (`handleKeyDown`).

## Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
- **Pass**: The `Footer` component displays the count of active items, includes filter links that dispatch the `setFilter` action, and has a button to clear completed items that dispatches the `removeCompleted` action.

## Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
- **Pass**: The `Footer` component includes a button with the class `clear-completed` that dispatches the `removeCompleted` action when clicked.
