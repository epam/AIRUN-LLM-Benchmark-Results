# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props
  
  The code examples consistently use TypeScript with proper type annotations for component props, state variables, and functions. For example, `PageFormProps` interface defines component props, `React.FC<PageFormProps>` properly types the functional component, and various types like `PageState`, `SavePagePayload` are used throughout.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management
  
  The implementation clearly uses Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` API for state management. This is evident in the `pageSlice.ts` file where `createSlice` from '@reduxjs/toolkit' is imported and used to create a slice with initial state, reducers, and action creators.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components
  
  All components in the example are implemented as functional components using the `React.FC` type annotation, like in `const PageForm: React.FC<PageFormProps> = ({ isDuplicate }) => {...}`, demonstrating a modern approach using hooks rather than class components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately
  
  The code properly uses React hooks like `useState` for local state management, `useEffect` for side effects and lifecycle management. For example, `useEffect` is used to initialize form values from Redux state and to auto-generate URL from title.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource
  
  The implementation demonstrates proper use of axios for API communication in the `pageAPI.ts` file, with functions like `createPage`, `updatePage`, and `deletePage` all using axios for HTTP requests.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components
  
  Form handling is correctly implemented using controlled components where form values are stored in state variables and `onChange` handlers update the state. For example, `value={localTitle}` and `onChange={(e) => setLocalTitle(e.target.value)}` show proper controlled component implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation
  
  React Router v6 is properly implemented in the `AppRouter.tsx` file, using `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, and `Route` components for routing. The code also demonstrates using `useNavigate` hook for programmatic navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization
  
  The solution properly implements internationalization using react-i18next, with a proper i18n setup in `i18n/index.ts` and demonstration of usage with the `useTranslation` hook.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization
  
  Code splitting is mentioned in the Performance & Optimization section with specific recommendations to use React.lazy or dynamic import() for router-based code splitting.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations
  
  The solution recommends using React.memo for expensive operations or large lists in the Performance & Optimization section.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks
  
  The code demonstrates proper use of dependency arrays in useEffect hooks. For example, `useEffect(() => {...}, [page])` to watch for page changes and `useEffect(() => {...}, [localTitle])` to auto-generate URL when title changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models
  
  TypeScript interfaces are properly defined for data models, including `PageState` and `SavePagePayload` in the `pageTypes.ts` file, which define the shape of page data and payloads for API operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state
  
  Redux selectors are properly used to access state, as seen in `useAppSelector((state: RootState) => state.page)` to select the page state from the Redux store.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations
  
  Action creators are properly exported from the Redux slice with `export const { setPage, updateField,
