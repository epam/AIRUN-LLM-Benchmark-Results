# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented

    The code shows clear implementations for creating and updating pages through the `createPage` and `updatePage` functions in the pageAPI.ts file, and the `deletePage` function is also present. The `PageForm` component includes logic that determines whether to create a new page or update an existing one, and there's a prop `isDuplicate` that suggests duplication functionality. However, I'm not 100% confident because while the core functionality is there, I don't see the complete implementation of the duplicate functionality in action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present

    The page type selection functionality is implemented in the PageForm component where the page type is included in the SavePagePayload and has a default value of 'default' if not specified: `type: page.type || 'default'`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists

    URL auto-generation from title is explicitly implemented in the PageForm component with a useEffect hook that converts the title to a URL-friendly format:
    ```javascript
    useEffect(() => {
      if (!page.id && localTitle && (localURL === 'new' || localURL === '')) {
        setLocalURL(
          localTitle
            .toLowerCase()
            .replace(/ /g, '-')
            .replace(/[\.,\/#!$%\^&\*;:{}=_'~()?]/g, '')
        )
      }
    }, [localTitle])
    ```

- **Fail** (80%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented

    While the code includes tags in the PageState interface and SavePagePayload, and there's a reference to page.tags in the PageForm component, there is no explicit implementation of tag management with autocomplete suggestions shown in the provided code. There's a reference to "If duplicating or new, create. Otherwise, update existing" which suggests this functionality should exist, but the actual implementation isn't visible in the snippets provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available

    The publish status options are clearly implemented in the PageForm component with a select element that offers "Publish" (Y), "Draft" (N), and "Schedule" as options:
    ```jsx
    <select
      value={localPublish}
      onChange={(e) => setLocalPublish(e.target.value)}
    >
      <option value="Y">Publish</option>
      <option value="N">Draft</option>
      <option value="schedule">Schedule</option>
    </select>
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented

    Scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented with conditional rendering based on the publish status. When the publish status is set to 'schedule', a datetime-local input appears:
    ```jsx
    {localPublish === 'schedule' && (
      <input
        type="datetime-local"
        value={
          localScheduleDate
            ? localScheduleDate.toISOString().slice(0, 16)
            : ''
        }
        onChange={(e) => setLocalScheduleDate(new Date(e.target.value))}
      />
    )}
    ```

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present

    Local storage functionality is implemented through a custom hook `useLocalStorage` which handles both storing and retrieving values. The example shows how to use it for saving draft titles, but the exact implementation of version comparison isn't explicit. However, the structure is there to support this feature:
    ```javascript
    const [draftTitle, setDraftTitle] = useLocalStorage<string>('pageTitle', '')

    useEffect(() => {
      // whenever localTitle changes, update local storage
      setDraftTitle(localTitle)
    }, [localTitle, setDraftTitle])
    ```

- **Fail** (90%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented

    While there is error handling in the code (e.g., `console.error('Error saving page', error)` and a comment `// show error message`), there's no explicit implementation of a notification system for displaying success or error messages to the user. The code has the structure for handling errors, but the
