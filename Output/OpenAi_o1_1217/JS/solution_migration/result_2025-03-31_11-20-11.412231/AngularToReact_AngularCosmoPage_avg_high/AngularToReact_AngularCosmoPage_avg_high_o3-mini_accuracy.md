# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props  
  All provided code samples (e.g., PageForm.tsx, pageTypes.ts) make use of TypeScript and include interfaces and explicit type annotations for function parameters and props.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management  
  The answer clearly shows Redux Toolkitâ€™s createSlice in pageSlice.ts along with its integration in the store configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components  
  Every React component example (e.g., PageForm, AppRouter) is implemented as a functional component.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately  
  The sample code incorporates essential hooks like useState and useEffect. Although useCallback and useMemo are mentioned in the optimization guidelines, they are not demonstrated explicitly in the provided examples. This may be acceptable for a high-level guide, but the use of these hooks in concrete examples is missing. Hence, Pass with slightly lower confidence.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource  
  The API communication example (pageAPI.ts) is implemented using axios.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components  
  The PageForm.tsx component uses controlled input elements where the component state is bound to form values.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation  
  The AppRouter.tsx sample utilizes react-router-dom for handling routes and navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization  
  The guide includes an example using react-i18next for internationalization.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization  
  Although the guide mentions code-splitting (e.g., using React.lazy or dynamic import), no concrete code example demonstrates its implementation. The answer only provides a recommendation rather than an implementation.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations  
  The provided code examples do not include any use of React.memo to optimize performance for expensive render operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks  
  The useEffect hooks in PageForm.tsx include appropriate dependency arrays (e.g., [page] and [localTitle]), ensuring correct hook behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models  
  The answer defines TypeScript interfaces for data models (e.g., PageState and SavePagePayload) in pageTypes.ts.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state  
  The PageForm.tsx component uses useAppSelector to retrieve the state, which is a standard Redux selector approach.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations  
  The pageSlice defines multiple action creators (setPage, updateField, savePage) for state mutations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks  
  The guide includes a custom hook (useLocalStorage) that wraps localStorage functionality for React applications.
