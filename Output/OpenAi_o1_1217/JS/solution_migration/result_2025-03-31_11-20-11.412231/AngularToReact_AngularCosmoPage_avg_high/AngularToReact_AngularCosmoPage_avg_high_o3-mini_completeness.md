# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass** (90%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
   The answer provides API functions for creating, updating, and deleting pages and references duplicate functionality in the PageForm component (via the isDuplicate prop and conditional logic). However, the duplicate behavior is only mentioned implicitly, which leads to a slight uncertainty.  
   
2. **Fail** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
   The answer defines a page property "type" in the state and payload (defaulting to 'default' if not already present) but does not include a dedicated user interface control or explicit functionality for selecting or changing the page type.  
   
3. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
   An effect in the PageForm component automatically generates the URL from the title (when the page is new or the URL is set to 'new' or empty), fulfilling this requirement.  
   
4. **Fail** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
   Although tag data is part of the PageState, there is no implementation of tag management UI or autocomplete suggestions for tags; the answer does not cover this functionality in any detail.  
   
5. **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
   The PageForm component includes a select input offering "Publish" (Y), "Draft" (N), and "Schedule" options, satisfying this criterion.  
   
6. **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
   When the publish status is set to "schedule," a datetime-local input appears for selecting a scheduled date, which correctly implements this functionality.  
   
7. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
   While a custom hook for local storage is provided and used to store draft data, the functionality to compare versions or restore a previous version is missing from the implementation.  
   
8. **Fail** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
   The answer uses a basic alert for invalid URL input and console.error for error logging, but it does not implement a robust notification system for handling success and error messages.  
   
9. **Fail** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
   Although the URL field is validated (alerting when it is empty or "new"), there is no visible validation for the page type or other required fields.  
   
10. **Fail** (90%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
    The answer implements basic endpoints for create, update, and delete. However, other endpoints (e.g., for tags, extras, and revisions) are only mentioned in comments without concrete implementations, leading to uncertainty whether all endpoints from the original code are fully handled.  
   
11. **Pass** (80%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
    The PageState and SavePagePayload include an "extras" field, and the Redux slice has an update mechanism for it. However, no dedicated UI component or in-depth example is provided, so extras management appears minimal.  
   
12. **Fail** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
    Although the API file comments mention revisions, the answer does not implement any actual revision history functionality.  
   
13. **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
    The provided folder structure clearly separates features, components, hooks, and other concerns, demonstrating a well-organized project architecture.  
   
14. **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
    An i18n setup using react-i18next is included along with an example usage in React components, indicating that translation functionality is migrated correctly.  
   
15. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
    The use of React Router (with routes such as "/new" and "/:url") successfully maps to AngularJS route parameters (e.g., $routeParams.url), preserving the URL structure.
