# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling
  
  The SignupComponent clearly uses Angular's Reactive Forms. We can see this through the use of FormBuilder, formControlName directives, and form validation logic using Validators.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)
  
  The form validations are properly implemented:
  - Name length validation is performed through the custom `validateNameLength` method, checking for 3-60 characters
  - Email format validation is handled by `validateEmail` with a regex pattern
  - Password length validation uses `Validators.minLength(6)`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use
  
  The component implements proper async validators:
  - `uniqueNameValidator()` calls `apiService.isName()` to check if a name is already taken
  - `uniqueEmailValidator()` calls `apiService.isEmail()` to check if an email is already registered

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback when touched
  
  The FormGroupComponent checks for `control.invalid && control.touched` before displaying validation messages, ensuring feedback appears only after user interaction.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions
  
  The signup form submission correctly:
  1. Checks form validity
  2. Sets submitting flag
  3. Extracts form values
  4. Dispatches the signup action with the required parameters
  
  The AuthEffects then uses the ApiService to make the actual API call.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails
  
  The FormGroupComponent template contains conditional error messages that display when specific validation errors occur. These messages appear below the form fields as required.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service
  
  There is no evidence of Angular's Title service being used in the provided code. The Title service would typically be imported from `@angular/platform-browser` and used to set the document title, but this is not present in any of the provided components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management
  
  The code properly implements NgRx:
  - Actions are defined in auth.actions.ts
  - Effects are implemented in auth.effects.ts
  - The store is injected and used in the SignupComponent

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress
  
  The submit button has `[disabled]="signupForm.invalid || submitting"` which disables it when either the form is invalid or the form is currently being submitted.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses
  
  The AuthEffects properly handles both success and error cases:
  - Maps successful responses to `signupSuccess` action
  - Catches errors and returns `signupFailure` action

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management
  
  The component follows Angular best practices:
  - Uses dependency injection for services
  - Implements OnInit interface
  - Uses input decorators for component communication
  - Uses proper template binding and events

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises
  
  The ApiService correctly uses Angular's HttpClient for making HTTP requests and returns Observables rather than promises.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements
  
  The FormGroupComponent displays appropriate error messages for each validation case, including name taken, email taken, required fields, invalid email, minimum password length, and name length requirements.
