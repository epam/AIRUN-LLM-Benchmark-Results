# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The SignupComponent uses Angularâ€™s FormBuilder (via this.fb.group) to create the form, which is a standard practice for Reactive Forms.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The synchronous validators include a custom name length validator, an email format validator (with regex), and the built-in Validators for required fields and minimum length on the password.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  The component provides asynchronous validators (uniqueNameValidator and uniqueEmailValidator) which use the ApiService methods isName and isEmail to verify if the values are already taken.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The app-form-group component displays error messages when a field is touched and invalid. However, only error messages are shown without explicit "success" styling. This is acceptable for many applications, but the absence of visible success indicators slightly reduces clarity.  
  Explanation: I am 90% confident because while error feedback is handled, the requirement for success styling is not explicitly implemented.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  On submission, the SignupComponent dispatches a signup action with the form values. Although the component itself does not directly invoke the API service, the interaction is correctly set up with @ngrx/store and is handled in the AuthEffects where the API call is made.  
  Explanation: I give 95% confidence because the API call is indirectly invoked through effects, which meets the spirit of the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The form-group component displays specific error messages based on the control's errors property when the control is invalid and touched.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  There is no evidence that the component or any related module uses Angular's Title service to set the page title.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The code clearly imports and uses @ngrx/store in the SignupComponent and @ngrx/effects is set up in a separate effects file for handling side effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button is disabled using the condition [disabled]="signupForm.invalid || submitting", thereby preventing multiple submissions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  In AuthEffects, the signup$ effect handles both success responses (dispatching signupSuccess) and error responses (dispatching signupFailure) with the appropriate use of catchError.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component correctly implements OnInit, uses dependency injection, and organizes form creation and submission effectively.  
  Explanation: I am 90% confident because while the basic practices are followed, additional best practice considerations (such as unsubscribing from observables if necessary or further modularization) are not explicitly demonstrated.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The ApiService uses Angular's HttpClient to perform HTTP requests, adhering to the recommended approach for API interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The error messages for various validation failures (e.g., nameTaken, emailTaken, invalidEmail, required, minlength, and nameLength) match the intended specifications laid out in the requirements.
