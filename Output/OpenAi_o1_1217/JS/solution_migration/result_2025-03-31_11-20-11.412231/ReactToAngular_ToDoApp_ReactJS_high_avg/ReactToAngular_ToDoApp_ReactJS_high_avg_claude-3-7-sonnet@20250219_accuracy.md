# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The code makes specific reference to Angular v14 in the opening statement and uses Angular CLI commands (`ng new`, `ng add`) that are compatible with Angular 14. The code structure and syntax throughout the examples are consistent with Angular 14.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
  
  The code includes proper implementation of NgRx store with installation commands (`ng add @ngrx/store@latest`) and proper implementation of store features including actions, reducers, and selectors in separate files.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
  
  The code includes NgRx effects implementation with installation command (`ng add @ngrx/effects@latest`) and a proper example of effects in `todo.effects.ts` that handles loading todos from localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
  
  The code provides comprehensive implementations of actions (`todo.actions.ts`), reducers (`todo.reducer.ts`), and selectors (`todo.selectors.ts`) following NgRx patterns. The actions define all necessary operations (load, add, toggle, etc.), the reducer properly handles state transitions, and selectors provide various views of the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
  
  The components in the code use appropriate Angular decorators: @Component for component definitions, @Input for parent-to-child data flow (e.g., in todo-item.component.ts), and @Output with EventEmitter for child-to-parent communication (e.g., in todo-footer.component.ts).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators
  
  The code mentions replacing React refs with either @ViewChild or template variables (#myRef) in Section 7, and while specific @ViewChild implementations aren't shown in the code samples, the approach is correctly described.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
  
  The components demonstrate proper use of @Input() for property binding (e.g., `@Input() todo!: Todo;` in todo-item.component.ts) and @Output() with EventEmitter for event handling (e.g., `@Output() clearCompleted = new EventEmitter<void>();` in todo-footer.component.ts).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
  
  The code includes a TodoService implementation that encapsulates interaction with the NgRx store, demonstrating proper use of Angular services for data handling and business logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
  
  Dependency injection is properly implemented throughout the application, including services registered with `@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })` and components injecting the Store and other services through constructors.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
  
  The code mentions using OnPush change detection in section 9 as an optimization, though specific implementations aren't shown in the component code samples. This is acknowledged as an "optional optimization" which explains why it's not in every component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
  
  Angular Router is properly implemented with route definitions in todo-routing.module.ts and router directives (routerLink, routerLinkActive) in the templates, replacing React Router functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code follows Angular style guide conventions with proper file naming (kebab-case), feature modules, component organization, and separation of concerns.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
  
  TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained with well-defined interfaces for Todo and TodoState, and appropriate typing throughout the codebase.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
  
  The code correctly converts JSX templates to Angular HTML templates, replacing React syntax with Angular template syntax (e.g., *ng
