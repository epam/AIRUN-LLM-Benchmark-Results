# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items

    The code includes proper components and state management to display todo items. The TodoAppComponent retrieves todos from the store using selectors and renders them in the template with `*ngFor`. The filtering logic correctly handles displaying all, active, or completed todos based on the current route.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented

    The 'addTodo' functionality is properly implemented. The TodoAppComponent has a method `onAddTodo()` that trims the input and dispatches the appropriate action to add a todo to the store. The component also includes proper input binding with `[(ngModel)]="newTitle"` and handling enter key with `(keydown.enter)="onAddTodo()"`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works

    Toggling todo items is properly implemented. The TodoItemComponent has an `onToggle()` method that dispatches the 'toggleTodo' action with the appropriate todo ID. The reducer correctly updates the state by inverting the 'completed' property.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented

    Editing functionality is well-implemented. The TodoItemComponent includes an editing mode state, methods for handling edit start, save, and cancel operations. The component properly dispatches the 'saveTodo' action when saving changes and includes keyboard event handling for enter and escape keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented

    Deleting todo items is implemented correctly with the `onDestroy()` method in TodoItemComponent, which dispatches the 'destroyTodo' action. The reducer then filters out the todo with the specified ID from the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented

    The 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented. The TodoAppComponent includes an `onToggleAll()` method that dispatches the 'toggleAll' action with the completed state. The template includes the toggle-all checkbox with proper binding.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works

    Filtering functionality is implemented with Angular routing. The TodoRoutingModule defines routes for '', 'active', and 'completed'. The TodoAppComponent subscribes to route changes to update the 'nowShowing' property, which is used to determine which todos to display.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items

    The TodoFooterComponent correctly calculates and displays the active items count using a getter method `activeCount()` that filters the todos array. The template displays this count with appropriate pluralization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items

    The 'Clear completed' button functionality is implemented with an event emitter in the TodoFooterComponent and an `onClearCompleted()` method in the TodoAppComponent that dispatches the 'clearCompleted' action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage

    Persistence to localStorage is implemented using NgRx Effects. The TodoEffects class includes an effect that loads todos from localStorage on application start. The code mentions that additional effects could be added to save todos after each state change.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation

    The URL structure is preserved using Angular routing with the hash strategy mentioned in section 8. The TodoRoutingModule defines routes that match the original React Router paths, and the code suggests configuring RouterModule with `{ useHash: true }` to maintain the hash-based routing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states

    Empty states are handled appropriately with `*ngIf="(allTodos$ | async)?.length > 0"` in the main section of the TodoAppComponent template and `*ngIf="todos.length > 0"` in the TodoFooterComponent template.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly

    Form submissions are handled correctly. The TodoAppComponent handles the enter key event on the new todo input, and the TodoItemComponent handles form events for editing, including blur, enter, and escape key events.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application maintains proper component
