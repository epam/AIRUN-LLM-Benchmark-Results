# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The instructions and code explicitly state the migration is for Angular v14 and the sample code, including Angular CLI commands, reflect this.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The sample code registers the store in app.module.ts and utilizes feature modules that use @ngrx/store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  The implementation of a TodoEffects class with createEffect and the registration of effects in app.module.ts demonstrate this.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  The answer provides clear examples of actions (todo.actions.ts), reducers (todo.reducer.ts), and selectors (todo.selectors.ts).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  Each component (TodoAppComponent, TodoItemComponent, and TodoFooterComponent) correctly uses @Component and the respective @Input and @Output decorators.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  The explanation mentions that React refs should be replaced by @ViewChild (or template references). While the provided example explains the approach, no explicit use of @ViewChild is demonstrated in the sample components. This gap leads to a slightly less than full confidence.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  The components clearly utilize @Input for passing data and @Output with EventEmitter for raising events.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  The TodoService is provided and encapsulates actions dispatch, demonstrating the use of services for business logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  The constructor injections in components and services (e.g., injecting Store and ActivatedRoute) show proper use of Angular dependency injection.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  Although the answer mentions the optional switch to OnPush change detection as an optimization, none of the component declarations include an explicit changeDetection strategy. This results in a failure for this evaluation step.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  Angular Router is utilized via the todo-routing.module.ts and the usage of routerLink directives in components such as TodoFooterComponent.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The sample code mostly adheres to Angular style guide recommendations. Minor improvements could be made (e.g., explicitly setting change detection strategies), but overall the code follows good practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  TypeScript interfaces (such as Todo and TodoState) are defined and used throughout the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  All templates are provided as separate HTML files and follow Angular’s template syntax rather than JSX.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  Event handling is managed using Angular’s event binding syntax (e.g., (click), (keydown.enter)) instead of React’s JSX style event handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  There are no placeholder TODO comments within the code; only informative comments exist.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  Although the answer discusses lazy loading as an optional optimization in step 9, the provided sample implementation in app.module.ts imports TodoModule directly rather than using lazy loading syntax. This does not fulfill the lazy loading requirement.
