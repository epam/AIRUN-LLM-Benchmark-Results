# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The code in the TodoAppComponent uses observable sources (allTodos$, activeTodos$, completedTodos$) and correctly displays the full list when “all” is selected.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The onAddTodo() method in TodoAppComponent dispatches an addTodo action when a nonempty title is provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  In the TodoItemComponent the onToggle() method dispatches a toggleTodo action, while the TodoAppComponent manages “toggle-all” functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent implements onEdit(), onSave(), and onCancel() methods to support editing of a todo item’s title.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent provides an onDestroy() method that dispatches a destroyTodo action, enabling deletion of a todo item.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  The TodoAppComponent includes an onToggleAll() method that dispatches toggleAll with the desired completed status.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  Based on the route (via ActivatedRoute subscription) the nowShowing state is set, and the UI displays the appropriate observable list (allTodos$, activeTodos$, or completedTodos$).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooterComponent computes activeCount by filtering the todos array, and the count is displayed in the template.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The clearCompleted action is dispatched when the Clear Completed button is clicked, which is handled by the reducer to remove completed items.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  While an effect (loadTodos$) is provided for retrieving todos from localStorage, there is no implemented persistence logic (i.e. saving updated state back), and the code comments it as optional. Thus, the persistence functionality is incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The TodoRoutingModule correctly defines routes for '', 'active', and 'completed', preserving the intended URL structure similar to the original React application.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  The main section and footer are conditionally rendered based on the existence of todos (using *ngIf). Though there is no explicit “empty state” message, hiding the main list and footer when there are no todos is acceptable. The slight deduction is because a dedicated empty state UI might improve user experience.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  The onAddTodo() method tied to the (keydown.enter) event in the input ensures proper handling of form submissions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The application is well structured into TodoAppComponent (container), TodoItemComponent (presentational for individual todos) and TodoFooterComponent, with proper use of @Input() and @Output().

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  The provided migration covers all major functionalities (CRUD operations, filtering, toggling, and even persistent loading from localStorage), retaining the business logic of the typical todo application.
