# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The answer clearly instructs to “CREATE A NEW ANGULAR 14 PROJECT” and all subsequent instructions and configurations reference Angular 14.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
  The instructions explicitly state “REMOVE REQUIREJS AND USE ES MODULES”, and the code examples use standard ES module import/export.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
  The provided code demonstrates usage of StoreModule.forRoot in the main module and StoreModule.forFeature in the TodosModule.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
  The code includes both EffectsModule.forRoot and EffectsModule.forFeature as well as an example TodoEffects class, satisfying this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
  The complete NgRx artifacts (actions, reducer, selectors, and effects) for managing todos are provided and correctly structured.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
  The TodoStorageService is properly decorated with @Injectable(), ensuring Angular’s dependency injection works.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
  The TodoStorageService uses localStorage via setItem and getItem to store and retrieve todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
  All components in the provided samples (e.g., TodoAppComponent, TodoHeaderComponent, etc.) include the @Component decorator with templates and styles correctly defined.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
  Both the todo-focus.directive.ts and todo-escape.directive.ts correctly utilize the @Directive decorator.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
  The component HTML examples use Angular template syntax such as *ngFor and *ngIf appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
  The templates include correct event binding, for example (click)="..." in several components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
  The code in the todo-list.component.html uses property binding, for instance [class.completed]="todo.completed", in accordance with Angular standards.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
  The todo-focus directive uses the ngOnChanges lifecycle hook to respond to input changes. Other components do not require additional hooks based on their functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
  The code references models such as Todo and Filter from the models directory, demonstrating proper use of TypeScript interfaces or classes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
  All components and services properly inject dependencies via their constructors (e.g., Store, TodoStorageService).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The project structure, naming conventions, and separation of concerns follow recommended Angular best practices and the official style guide.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
  Although the code appears to be free of issues and structured correctly, the evaluation is based solely on a visual inspection. Without executing the code, there is a slight uncertainty, thus a confidence of 90%.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
  The examples make use of TypeScript features such as type annotations and interfaces (e.g., in actions and models), reinforcing type safety.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
  The provided examples do not include any commented-out code or TODO comments, indicating a clean codebase.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows the single responsibility principle in component design  
  The design clearly segments responsibilities across different modules, components, services, and directives, adhering to the single responsibility principle.
