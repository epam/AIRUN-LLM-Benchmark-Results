# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list  
  The provided solution includes a dedicated TodoListComponent with its HTML template that renders the list of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos  
  The TodoHeaderComponent is defined for creating new todos, dispatching an addTodo action when a new todo is submitted.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos  
  Editing is implemented in TodoListComponent where a todo’s title can be edited (with support for finishing and reverting edits).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos  
  The TodoFooterComponent includes UI elements (links) that allow switching between filter views (all, active, completed).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics  
  The footer component calculates and displays the count of active (remaining) and completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos  
  The addTodo method in TodoHeaderComponent dispatches an action to add a todo to the store, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos  
  The TodoListComponent includes logic to edit a todo’s title and dispatches an edit action when the change is confirmed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos  
  A remove button is provided in the TodoListComponent; clicking it dispatches a removeTodo action to delete the todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed  
  The TodoListComponent contains a function (toggleCompletion) that toggles the completion status of a todo through a dispatched action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)  
  The filtering is implemented in TodoFooterComponent through clickable links that dispatch the setFilter action and in selectors that filter the list.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete  
  An input element in TodoListComponent is used to trigger markAllCompleted, allowing all todos to be marked complete or incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos  
  The clearCompleted action is dispatched from TodoFooterComponent when the “Clear completed” button is clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos  
  The TodoFooterComponent selects and displays the active todo count using selectActiveCount.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage  
  The TodoStorageService implements a syncStateToLocalStorage method, and the NgRx Effect calls it to persist changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization  
  The TodoStorageService provides a loadTodosFromLocalStorage method to retrieve todos from localStorage at startup.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing  
  In the TodoListComponent’s template, a keydown listener for ‘Escape’ is wired to revertEditing, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Fail** (80%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo  
  Although a todo-focus.directive is provided, none of the component templates explicitly apply this directive to an input field during editing. The header input uses the autofocus attribute, but there is no clear evidence that focus is managed when switching into edit mode within the list. (The 80% confidence level reflects that while the directive exists, it is not clearly integrated in the editing workflow.)

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original  
  The code structure (HTML templates using classes such as “todoapp”, “header”, “main”, “footer”, etc.) closely mimics the original TodoMVC style. However, without the actual CSS and runtime preview, this assessment is based on code conventions and naming. (80% confident)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately  
  In both addTodo (by returning early if the trimmed title is empty) and doneEditing (by calling removeTodo when the title becomes empty), the application properly handles empty titles.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter  
  Although filter buttons exist in the footer to change the displayed todos, there is no implementation that updates the URL (for example, via Angular’s router with query parameters or specific routes) based on the selected filter.
