# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed

  The implementation in the `App.tsx` component correctly handles the creation of new todos when the Enter key is pressed. The `handleNewTodoKeyDown` function checks for the Enter key (using the ENTER_KEY constant), trims the input value, and dispatches the `addTodo` action if the value is not empty, then clears the input field.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter

  The `TodoList.tsx` component properly filters todos based on the current filter value. It uses the `useMemo` hook to efficiently filter the todos based on the filter state ('all', 'active', or 'completed'), and renders the filtered list.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos

  The implementation includes an "toggle-all" input in the `App.tsx` component that triggers the `handleToggleAll` function, which dispatches the `toggleAll` action to mark all todos as completed or not completed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted

  The `TodoItem.tsx` component provides handlers for all these operations. It has `handleToggle`, `handleEdit`, and `handleDestroy` functions that appropriately dispatch the corresponding Redux actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode

  In the `TodoItem.tsx` component, the label has an `onDoubleClick` event that calls the `handleEdit` function, which sets the editing state to true and initializes the edit text.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo

  The `handleKeyDown` function in `TodoItem.tsx` checks for the Enter key and calls `handleSubmit` when detected, which dispatches the `saveTodo` action with the edited text.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value

  The `handleKeyDown` function in `TodoItem.tsx` also checks for the Escape key and, when detected, sets editing to false and restores the edit text to the original todo title.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items

  The `Footer.tsx` component displays the active todo count along with the appropriate singular or plural form of "item".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)

  The `Footer.tsx` component includes links for all three filter types with appropriate href values and click handlers that dispatch the `setFilter` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos

  The `Footer.tsx` component includes a "Clear completed" button that is conditionally rendered when there are completed todos. The button's onClick handler calls the `onClearCompleted` prop, which is connected to the `clearCompleted` action in the `App.tsx` component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence

  The application persists todos in localStorage. The initial state is loaded from localStorage in the `todoSlice.ts`, and changes are saved to localStorage through a Redux store subscriber in `store.ts`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state

  Several UI elements are conditionally rendered based on the todo state. For example, the main section is only shown when there are todos, the footer is only shown when there are active or completed todos, and the "Clear completed" button is only shown when there are completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count

  In the `Footer.tsx` component, the code correctly pluralizes the word "item" based on the `activeTodoCount` (using "item" for 1, "items" for other counts).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components

  The application is well-structured with separate components for different parts of the UI (`App`, `TodoList`, `TodoItem`, `Footer`), each with a clear, focused responsibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality

  The code is organized in a clear,
