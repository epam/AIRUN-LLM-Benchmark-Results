# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all React imports use React 18.x compatible syntax  
  The code uses “import React…” in components and properly imports “createRoot” from "react-dom/client" in main.tsx, which is compliant with React 18.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all components use functional component syntax with hooks instead of class components  
  All components (e.g., App, TodoList, TodoItem, Footer) are implemented as functional components and make use of hooks like useState, useEffect, and useCallback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Redux Toolkit's createSlice is used for state management  
  The file src/redux/todoSlice.ts demonstrates the use of createSlice from Redux Toolkit to define reducers and actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for all props, state, and Redux store  
  TypeScript interfaces such as Todo, TodoState, FilterType, and props interfaces (e.g., TodoItemProps and FooterProps) are properly defined, and types are used in Redux store configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses immutable state updates in reducers  
  Although the reducers use direct mutations (e.g., state.todos.push(...)), Redux Toolkit’s Immer integration handles immutability transparently.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that nanoid is used for ID generation instead of custom UUID implementation  
  The addTodo reducer utilizes nanoid() from the "nanoid" package, confirming the modern approach to generating unique IDs.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application uses React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate  
  Components such as TodoList, TodoItem, and Footer are wrapped in React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that useCallback is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders  
  The implementation includes useCallback for functions like handleNewTodoKeyDown, handleToggleAll, and event handlers in TodoItem, thereby optimizing re-render behaviors.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage handling is implemented in a modern way  
  The code includes a try/catch block in the loadTodosFromStorage function and subscribes to the Redux store to persist state changes to localStorage, aligning with modern practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows consistent naming conventions throughout the application  
  Naming conventions for files, components, variables, and functions are consistent and clear across the project.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper error handling is implemented where necessary  
  The code includes error handling in localStorage operations (using try/catch) and maintains robustness in Redux reducers, which is appropriate for the given context.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware  
  By using Redux Toolkit’s configureStore, the store is set up with the default middleware (including thunk and Immer), which is sufficient for this application’s requirements.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that React.lazy is used for code splitting where appropriate  
  The code does not utilize React.lazy and Suspense for code splitting. While the application is structured well, using React.lazy could improve the performance in scenarios with larger components or routes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the codebase has no TODOs remaining  
  A review of the code shows there are no lingering TODO comments, indicating a clean and finalized codebase.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the Redux Provider wraps the application entry point  
  The entry point (main.tsx) correctly wraps the App component with the Redux <Provider>, ensuring that the Redux store is available throughout the component tree.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure strict TypeScript type checking is implemented throughout the application  
  Consistent use of TypeScript across components, Redux store, and interfaces reflects adherence to strict type checking practices.
