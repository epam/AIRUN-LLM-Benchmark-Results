# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The App component’s input field listens for keyDown events. The handler checks for the ENTER_KEY constant and dispatches the addTodo action when a trimmed non-empty value is provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The TodoList component uses useMemo to filter todos based on the current filter state and renders the resulting list, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  In the App component, the "toggle-all" checkbox invokes handleToggleAll, which dispatches the toggleAll action. This confirms that the application supports toggling the completion status of all todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  The TodoItem component provides a checkbox to toggle a todo’s completed status, an onDoubleClick event to enable editing, and a destroy button to delete a todo; all respective Redux actions are dispatched accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  The TodoItem component attaches an onDoubleClick event to the todo label that triggers handleEdit, setting editing mode to true. This behavior confirms the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  Inside TodoItem, handleKeyDown listens for the ENTER_KEY press and calls handleSubmit, which dispatches the saveTodo action when a valid edit text is provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  In the TodoItem component, pressing the ESCAPE_KEY during an edit triggers handleKeyDown, which resets the editText to the original todo.title and cancels editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  The Footer component receives activeTodoCount as a prop and displays it within a span, confirming that the number of active items is shown correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The Footer component renders three links (All, Active, Completed) that each dispatch the setFilter action when clicked, satisfying the filter functionality requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  The Footer component conditionally renders a "Clear completed" button when there are any completed todos, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  The Redux store subscribes to state changes and writes the todos array to localStorage, while the initial state is populated from localStorage via the loadTodosFromStorage function.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  The App component conditionally renders the main section (only if todos exist) and the Footer (based on active or completed counts), ensuring proper conditional rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  The Footer component correctly selects "item" when activeTodoCount equals 1, and "items" otherwise, meeting the pluralization requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The application is modularly divided into components such as App, TodoList, TodoItem, and Footer. Each has a distinct responsibility, confirming good component composition.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The project has a clear structure with separate folders for redux logic, components, and types, which demonstrates organization by feature and functionality.
