# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration
  
  The code explicitly mentions "npx create-react-app virtual-piano --template typescript" for initialization and uses React 18 specific features like ReactDOM.createRoot() in the index.tsx file.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure
  
  The code defines TypeScript interfaces and types including:
  - `NoteName` type for piano notes
  - `PianoKeyData` interface for key data
  - `Record<NoteName, HTMLAudioElement>` for sound mapping

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks
  
  The App component is implemented as a functional component using React hooks (useState, useRef, useEffect) following modern React patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)
  
  The code uses appropriate React state hooks:
  - `useState(false)` for `showLetters` toggle
  - `useState<Set<NoteName>>(new Set())` for `activeNotes`
  - `useState(false)` for `mouseDown` tracking

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels
  
  Keyboard event handlers are implemented at the container div level using onKeyDown and onKeyUp events with proper TypeScript typing:
  ```typescript
  const handleKeyDown = (e: KeyboardEvent<HTMLDivElement>) => { ... }
  const handleKeyUp = (e: KeyboardEvent<HTMLDivElement>) => { ... }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events
  
  Mouse event handlers are properly implemented for piano keys using React's synthetic events:
  ```typescript
  onMouseDown={() => handleKeyMouseDown(note)}
  onMouseUp={() => handleKeyMouseUp(note)}
  onMouseEnter={() => handleKeyMouseEnter(note)}
  onMouseOut={() => handleKeyMouseOut(note)}
  onMouseLeave={() => handleKeyMouseOut(note)}
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment
  
  Audio resources are properly handled using the Audio API with paths adjusted for the React environment:
  ```typescript
  const soundMapper: Record<NoteName, HTMLAudioElement> = {
    c: new Audio('/assets/audio/c.mp3'),
    // ... other audio files
  };
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility
  
  Fullscreen functionality is implemented using standard browser APIs within a React event handler:
  ```typescript
  const toggleFullScreen = () => {
    if (!document.fullscreenElement) {
      document.documentElement.requestFullscreen().catch((err) => {
        console.error(err);
      });
    } else {
      document.exitFullscreen().catch((err) => {
        console.error(err);
      });
    }
  };
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns
  
  Conditional class application follows React patterns using template literals and ternary operators:
  ```typescript
  className={`piano-key ${isSharp ? 'sharp' : ''} ${extraClass} ${isActive ? 'piano-key-active' : ''}`}
  ```

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate
  
  The code mentions potential performance optimizations in section 7, but doesn't actually implement React.memo in the provided code. However, it does acknowledge this as a best practice:
  
  "If you notice unnecessary re-renders, you can memoize certain components (e.g., PianoKey) with React.memo()."

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations
  
  Audio playback is properly managed through the playNote and releaseNote functions, resetting audio clips and managing the active state:
  ```typescript
  const playNote = (note: NoteName) => {
    // If this note is already active
