# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'  
  The header element includes an <h1> with the text "Virtual Piano", confirming the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons  
  A <div> with class "btn-container" is present, containing two buttons labeled "Notes" and "Letters", respectively.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)  
  The code maps over arrays "pianoLayout" for white keys and "pianoSharps" for sharp keys, ensuring both sets are rendered.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes  
  Each rendered piano key element includes "data-note" and "data-letter" attributes for proper identification.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked  
  On mouse events (onMouseDown), the code calls playNote(note) which resets and plays the corresponding audio file from the "soundMapper".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)  
  The active keys are tracked using the "activeNotes" state, and the class "piano-key-active" is applied to keys that are active.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes  
  Keyboard events (onKeyDown and onKeyUp) are attached to the container element with a proper tabIndex, and matching is done via the letter in the key arrays.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked  
  The state "showLetters" is toggled by the buttons, and the display on each key is determined conditionally based on this state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes  
  The fullscreen toggle button triggers the function "toggleFullScreen", which correctly requests or exits fullscreen mode based on the documentâ€™s current state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly  
  The implementation uses a Set ("activeNotes") to track active notes without overriding previous ones, thus supporting multiple simultaneous key presses.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys  
  The "mouseDown" state is used in combination with onMouseEnter and onMouseOut events, replicating the drag-over-key functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information  
  A footer element exists and contains a <div> with the year "2020", fulfilling the requirement.
