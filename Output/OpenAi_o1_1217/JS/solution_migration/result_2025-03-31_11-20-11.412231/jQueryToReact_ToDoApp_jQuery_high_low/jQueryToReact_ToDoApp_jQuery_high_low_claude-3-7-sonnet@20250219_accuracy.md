# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18.x
  
  The application is clearly built with React 18 as evidenced by the usage of ReactDOM.createRoot in src/index.tsx, which is a React 18-specific feature:
  ```typescript
  import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript for type safety
  
  TypeScript is thoroughly used throughout the codebase. This is evident from the file extensions (.ts, .tsx), type annotations, interfaces, and TypeScript-specific imports like:
  ```typescript
  import { RootState, AppDispatch } from '../../app';
  export interface Todo {...}
  export type FilterType = 'all' | 'active' | 'completed';
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for state management
  
  Redux Toolkit with createSlice is clearly implemented in todosSlice.ts:
  ```typescript
  import { createSlice, PayloadAction } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
  const todosSlice = createSlice({
    name: 'todos',
    initialState,
    reducers: {...}
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm nanoid is used for generating unique IDs
  
  nanoid is imported and used for generating unique IDs for todos:
  ```typescript
  import { nanoid } from 'nanoid';
  // Inside addTodo reducer:
  state.items.push({
    id: nanoid(),
    title,
    completed: false,
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code uses functional components with hooks instead of class components
  
  All components are implemented as functional components with React hooks:
  ```typescript
  const TodoHeader: React.FC = () => {
    const dispatch = useDispatch<AppDispatch>();
    const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');
    // ...
  }
  ```
  Hooks like useState, useEffect, useDispatch, and useSelector are used throughout the components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains the same routing functionality with proper route handling
  
  The application maintains the hash-based routing functionality, preserving the original behavior. This is implemented through HashRouter from react-router-dom and proper event handling:
  ```typescript
  // src/router/AppRouter.tsx
  import { HashRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
  
  // src/App.tsx
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!window.location.hash) {
      window.location.hash = '#/all';
    }
    window.addEventListener('hashchange', handleHashChange);
    // ...
  }, []);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Redux store is properly configured with appropriate slices
  
  The Redux store is properly configured in src/app/store.ts:
  ```typescript
  import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
  import todosReducer from '../features/todos/todosSlice';
  
  export const store = configureStore({
    reducer: {
      todos: todosReducer,
    },
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the Redux provider is set up in the application entry point
  
  The Redux Provider is set up in src/index.tsx, wrapping the entire application:
  ```typescript
  root.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
      <Provider store={store}>
        <AppRouter />
      </Provider>
    </React.StrictMode>
  );
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for all data structures
  
  TypeScript interfaces and types are properly defined, including:
  ```typescript
  // src/features/todos/types.ts
  export interface Todo {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    completed: boolean;
  }
  
  export type FilterType = 'all' | 'active' | 'completed';
  
  // And in to
