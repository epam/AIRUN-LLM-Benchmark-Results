  - React Router (`react-router-dom` package)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm documentation includes all available CLI commands with explanations for each command's purpose
  
  The README.md file includes all CLI commands with clear explanations:
  - `npm run dev` - Serves the application in development mode
  - `npm run build` - Creates an optimized production build
  - `npm run preview` - Serves the production build locally
  - `npm test` - Executes all tests using Vitest

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that package.json includes all necessary dependencies for the required technologies
  
  The package.json file includes all necessary dependencies for the required technologies, including:
  - Core libraries: React, Redux, React Router
  - TypeScript types: @types/react, @types/react-dom, @types/react-redux, @types/react-router-dom
  - Testing libraries: vitest, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom
  - Build tools: vite, @vitejs/plugin-react

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the project contains complete configuration files without placeholder comments or TODOs
  
  All configuration files are complete and contain no placeholder comments or TODOs:
  - package.json
  - tsconfig.json
  - vite.config.ts

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the presence of proper TypeScript type definitions throughout the project
  
  Proper TypeScript type definitions are present throughout the project:
  - RootState and AppDispatch types in store.ts
  - Type annotations for React components
  - Type imports from React and Redux libraries
  - TypeScript configuration in tsconfig.json

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure testing library configuration is complete with necessary setup files
  
  The testing configuration is complete:
  - Vitest is configured in vite.config.ts with jsdom environment
  - Testing libraries are properly imported in the test file
  - Test file includes proper setup with providers (Redux, Router)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the project structure includes directories for components, state management, and routing
  
  The project structure includes appropriate directories:
  - `src/features/counter` for component and related state management
  - Redux store setup in `src/store.ts`
  - Routing defined in `src/App.tsx` with React Router
  - Tests in a separate `tests` directory

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the entry point files for the application are properly defined
  
  Entry point files are properly defined:
  - `src/main.tsx` serves as the application entry point
  - It correctly sets up React, Redux Provider, and BrowserRouter
  - It renders the App component to the DOM

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all configuration follows established best practices for each technology
  
  The configurations follow established best practices:
  - TypeScript is configured with strict mode
  - Vite is set up with appropriate plugins
  - Redux is implemented using Redux Toolkit
  - React Router is set up with modern v6 syntax
  - Testing is configured with industry standard tools

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that build and environment configuration supports production deployment
  
  Build and environment configuration supports production deployment:
  - Vite's build script is configured in package.json
  - TypeScript configuration includes production-ready settings
  - The project includes preview functionality to test production builds
  - Dependencies are properly organized into dependencies and devDependencies
