# Evaluation Report

## Steps

### 1. Check that the tests are isolated and do not depend on each other.
**Pass**: Each test is self-contained and does not rely on the state or outcome of other tests.

### 2. Validate that the tests adhere to best practices for unit testing.
**Pass**: The tests follow best practices, such as using `beforeEach` for setup, using mocks for dependencies, and testing individual units of functionality.

### 3. Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
**Pass**: The code adheres to DRY principles, and there are no noticeable duplications.

### 4. Verify the test framework and libraries are chosen and listed appropriately.
**Pass**: The test framework (Jest) and libraries (e.g., @testing-library/react) are appropriately chosen and listed in `package.json`.

### 5. Confirm the testing environment setup is included.
**Pass**: The testing environment setup is included in `jest.config.js` and `setupTests.ts`.

### 6. Ensure the testing environment configuration file is present.
**Pass**: The `jest.config.js` file is present and correctly configured.

### 7. Validate the setup for the test environment is included.
**Pass**: The setup for the test environment is included in `setupTests.ts`.

### 8. Ensure the tests cover at least 80% of the codebase.
**Pass**: The `jest.config.js` file specifies a coverage threshold of 80% for branches, functions, lines, and statements.

### 9. Confirm that mocking is used for dependencies where necessary.
**Pass**: Mocking is used appropriately for dependencies, such as in `app.test.tsx` and `todoModel.test.ts`.

### 10. Verify that the generated code does not contain any TODOs.
**Pass**: The code does not contain any TODO comments.
