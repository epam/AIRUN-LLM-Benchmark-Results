# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist
  
  The test suite includes a "Rendering & Accessibility" section with tests like "renders without crashing and matches basic snapshot" and "renders the default placeholder when no value is selected".

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present
  
  The test suite includes keyboard navigation tests in the "User Interaction" section, specifically the test "handles keyboard navigation (arrow down, enter)" which tests arrow key and enter key navigation.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)
  
  The test suite includes tests for mouse interactions in the "User Interaction" section, specifically "opens the menu on click" and "handles mouse interactions on option selection".

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior
  
  The test suite tests both controlled behavior (by setting props like `value` and `menuIsOpen`) and uncontrolled behavior. However, there could be more explicit tests that specifically verify controlled vs. uncontrolled component behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values
  
  Tests for these state changes are included in the "State Management" section, with tests like "selecting a value updates the internal state for single select" and "clear button resets the value (isClearable=true)".

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented
  
  The test suite includes tests for menu opening/closing behavior, such as "opens the menu on click" and "menu closes after selecting an option if closeMenuOnSelect=true".

- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality
  
  The test suite includes tests for filtering options, specifically "filters options based on input" in the "Menu and Options" section.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist
  
  The test suite includes a test for multi-select behavior: "multi-select behaves correctly when selecting multiple options" in the "State Management" section.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility
  
  The test suite includes an "Accessibility" section with tests for ARIA roles and attributes, such as "includes basic ARIA roles" and "sets role=listbox when menu is open".

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested
  
  The test suite includes an "Edge Cases" section with a test for empty options: "renders correctly with empty options".

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states
  
  The test suite does not include tests for loading or error states. There are no tests that verify the component's behavior when in a loading state or when an error occurs.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states
  
  The test suite includes tests for disabled states in the "Edge Cases" section, such as "disables the component and ignores user input" and "handles custom isOptionDisabled logic".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance
  
  The test suite includes a "Performance" section with a test for rendering a large list of options efficiently.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested
  
  The test suite includes some tests for focus management, like "tabbing through the component moves focus correctly". However, more comprehensive focus management testing could be included to ensure focus is maintained appropriately throughout all user interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering
  
  The test suite includes tests for placeholder rendering: "renders the default placeholder when no value is selected" and value rendering is tested in various state management tests.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations
  
  The test suite does not include tests for custom formatOptionLabel implementations. This is an important feature of select components that should be tested to ensure custom formatting works as expected.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)
  
  While the test suite includes testing for `onChange` callback, it does not include tests for other callbacks like `onInputChange`, `onMenuOpen`, or `on
