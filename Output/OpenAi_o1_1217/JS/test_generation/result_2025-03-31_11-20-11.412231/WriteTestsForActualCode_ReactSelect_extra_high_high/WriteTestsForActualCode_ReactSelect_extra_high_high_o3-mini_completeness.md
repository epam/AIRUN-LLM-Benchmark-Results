# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass** (100%): Verified tests for basic component rendering with default props exist.  
   The "Rendering & Accessibility" section includes tests to render the component without crashing, a snapshot test, and a test for the default placeholder.

2. **Fail** (100%): Ensured tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape).  
   While tests exist for arrow keys, tab, and the enter key, there is no explicit test handling the Escape key.

3. **Fail** (100%): Validated presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering).  
   There are tests for clicking interactions on options and controls, but no test specifically simulating hover events.

4. **Pass** (100%): Confirmed test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior.  
   The tests check internal state updates (single select and via value props) and default rendering, which covers both controlled (via explicit value props) and uncontrolled (default placeholder) scenarios.

5. **Pass** (100%): Verified tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values.  
   Dedicated tests for selecting a value and clearing the selection confirm state changes.

6. **Pass** (100%): Ensured tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented.  
   The test suite includes behavior for opening the menu on click and closing it upon selecting an option.

7. **Pass** (100%): Validated test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality.  
   A test is provided that invokes filtering of options based on input.

8. **Pass** (100%): Confirmed tests for multi-select behavior exist.  
   The suite includes a test to simulate multi-select interactions, verifying that multiple options can be selected.

9. **Pass** (100%): Verified tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility.  
   Tests validate that ARIA attributes (such as aria-label) are set and the correct roles (combobox, listbox, option) are used.

10. **Pass** (100%): Ensured edge cases like empty options are tested.  
    A test validates that the component handles empty options by checking for a “No options” message.

11. **Fail** (100%): Validated tests for loading and error states.  
    There are no tests explicitly targeting loading states or error handling scenarios.

12. **Pass** (100%): Verified tests for disabled options/states.  
    Tests exist to check that the component ignores user input when disabled and handles custom disabled logic for options.

13. **Pass** (100%): Confirmed tests for large option sets to verify performance.  
    The performance section includes a test that renders a large list and verifies that it is processed efficiently.

14. **Pass** (100%): Ensured focus management during interactions is properly tested.  
    The accessibility tests include a scenario for tabbing and focus management.

15. **Pass** (100%): Verified tests for placeholder and value rendering.  
    The test suite confirms that the proper placeholder is rendered when no value is selected and that selected values are rendered correctly.

16. **Fail** (100%): Ensured test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations.  
    There is no test provided that covers custom implementations of formatOptionLabel.

17. **Fail** (100%): Verified callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose).  
    Although onChange is tested, there are no tests for onInputChange, onMenuOpen, or onMenuClose.

18. **Fail** (100%): Validated tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading).  
    The tests check for the clear indicator but do not cover the dropdown indicator or a loading indicator.
