# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering
- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos
- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos

    The provided app.tsx test file does not include specific tests for filtering todos. While it sets up a model and tests basic functionality like rendering, adding todos, and toggling all todos, there are no explicit tests that verify the filtering functionality (switching between ALL_TODOS, ACTIVE_TODOS, and COMPLETED_TODOS views).

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos

    The app.tsx test file does not include tests for clearing completed todos. This functionality should be tested by adding completed todos, triggering the clear completed action, and verifying the completed todos are removed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events
- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts
- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation
- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos
- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions

    The todoModel.ts test file does not include tests for the subscribe and inform functions, which are important for the event-driven architecture of the application. These tests would verify that callbacks are properly registered and triggered when the model state changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx
- **Fail** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data

    While the answer includes simple mock todos in individual tests, it does not establish reusable test fixtures for sample todo data. Best practice would be to create dedicated fixtures that can be imported and reused across different test files to ensure consistency.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented

    While there is a basic Router mock in setupTests.ts, the test files don't thoroughly test routing functionality. There should be specific tests that verify the application responds correctly to route changes, especially in the app.tsx test file. The confidence is 90% because there is some rudimentary Router mocking, but it's not thoroughly tested in the application tests.
