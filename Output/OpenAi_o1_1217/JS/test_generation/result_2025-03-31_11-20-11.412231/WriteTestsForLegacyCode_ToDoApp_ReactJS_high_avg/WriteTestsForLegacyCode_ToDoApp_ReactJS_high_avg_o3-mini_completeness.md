# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering  
  The app.test.tsx file contains the test “renders initial UI” that verifies the component rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos  
  The test “adds a new todo on Enter keydown with non-empty input” confirms that todos can be added successfully.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos  
  The test “toggles all todos when the toggle-all checkbox is clicked” demonstrates that the toggling functionality works as expected.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos  
  The provided app.test.tsx file does not contain any test case related to filtering todos. Although filtering tests are present in the footer.test.tsx file, this evaluation step specifically requires tests for filtering within the app.tsx file.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  There is no test in app.test.tsx that verifies clearing completed todos. The functionality is indirectly tested via the footer component, but not directly in app.tsx as required by this step.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering  
  The test “renders a todo item” in todoItem.test.tsx confirms that the component renders correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos  
  The tests “fires onToggle when checkbox is clicked”, “calls onDestroy when destroy button is clicked”, and “enables editing mode on double-click of the label” adequately cover toggling, destroying, and editing functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events  
  The test “submits edited text on Enter and calls onSave” demonstrates proper handling of keyboard events for editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts  
  The test “shows the correct items left count” confirms the footer correctly reflects different counts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation  
  The test “renders filter links correctly” ensures that navigation between filters (e.g., All, Active) is correctly marked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The test “calls onClearCompleted when clear completed button is clicked” confirms that the clear completed functionality works as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos  
  Multiple tests in todoModel.test.ts, such as “adds a todo”, “toggle() toggles the completed state”, “destroy() removes the specified todo”, and “save() updates a todo title”, validate these functionalities.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions  
  The provided tests for TodoModel do not include any test cases for the subscribe and inform functions, which are important for notifying subscribers about data changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The test “clearCompleted() removes all completed items” confirms that clearing completed todos functionality is covered.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation  
  The test “uuid() generates a string of the correct length” verifies that the UUID generation implements the correct format.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality  
  The test “pluralize() returns singular or plural properly” confirms correct pluralization behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations  
  The test “store() saves and retrieves data from localStorage” validates the proper operation of localStorage interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function  
  The test “extend() merges objects” confirms that object merging is handled correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx  
  All test files follow a consistent naming convention. Files with JSX content are named with the .test.tsx extension while others that do not use JSX are named .test.ts, which is acceptable for TypeScript projects.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data  
  The tests use sample data (e.g., the mockTodo in todoItem.test.tsx and a pre-populated localStorage in todoModel.test.ts) to verify functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented  
  The provided setupTests.ts file includes a rudimentary mock for the Router; however, there are no test cases that exercise or validate routing functionality using these mocks.
