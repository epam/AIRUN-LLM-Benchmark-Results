7. **Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React virtual DOM.**
   - **Pass**: The app does not manipulate the DOM directly outside of React's virtual DOM.

8. **Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React state and props.**
   - **Pass**: The app does not overuse refs for DOM access.

9. **Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.**
   - **Pass**: The app does not have unnecessary re-renders due to state or prop changes.

10. **Ensure the code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility.**

### Summary

- **Total number of steps evaluated**: 18
- **Number of passed steps**: 17
- **Number of failed steps**: 1

Overall, the code is well-structured, follows best practices, and is free of major issues. The only missing part is the confirmation of axios being listed as a dependency in the package.json file.
