# Evaluation Report

### **1. Functionality**

**a. User Registration Form:**
- **Form Fields:** The signup form includes input fields for **Name**, **Email**, and **Password**.
  - **Pass**: The form fields are correctly identified.
- **Validation:**
  - **Synchronous Validation:** Ensures that:
    - **Name:** Must be between 3 and 60 characters.
    - **Email:** Must be a valid email format.
    - **Password:** Must be at least 6 characters long.
    - **Pass**: Validation rules are correctly specified.
  - **Asynchronous Validation:** Checks the uniqueness of the **Name** and **Email** by making API calls to verify that they are not already in use.
    - **Pass**: Asynchronous validation is correctly described.
- **Form Submission:**
  - On submission, the form sends the data to the backend API (`api.signup`) to create a new user account.
  - Upon successful signup, it dispatches a `signupComplete` action.
  - Handles and displays any errors returned from the API during submission.
  - **Pass**: Form submission process is correctly described.

**b. UI Components:**
- **FormGroup Component (`form.js`):**
  - Wraps individual input fields.
  - Displays validation feedback (error or success) based on the field's state.
  - **Pass**: UI component functionality is correctly described.
- **Button with Icon:**
  - A submit button styled with Bootstrap, including an icon to enhance the user interface.
  - **Pass**: Button with icon is correctly described.

**c. Form Management:**
- Utilizes **redux-form** for managing form state, handling validation, and managing asynchronous operations.
  - **Pass**: Form management using `redux-form` is correctly described.

### **2. User Interaction**

**a. Registration Process:**
1. **Accessing the Signup Page:**
   - Users navigate to the signup page to create a new account.
   - **Pass**: Accessing the signup page is correctly described.
2. **Entering Information:**
   - Users fill in their **Name**, **Email**, and **Password** in the respective input fields.
   - **Pass**: Entering information is correctly described.
3. **Real-time Validation:**
   - As users input data, the form provides immediate feedback on the validity of their entries (e.g., indicating errors or success states).
   - **Pass**: Real-time validation is correctly described.
4. **Asynchronous Checks:**
   - Upon moving away (blurring) from the **Name** and **Email** fields, the form asynchronously checks if the entered values are unique.
   - **Pass**: Asynchronous checks are correctly described.
5. **Submitting the Form:**
   - Users click the **Signup** button to submit the form.
   - If there are validation errors, the form highlights them and prevents submission.
   - Upon successful submission, users receive confirmation, and the application updates appropriately (e.g., redirects to a dashboard).
   - **Pass**: Form submission process is correctly described.
6. **Error Handling:**
   - If the signup process fails (e.g., due to server issues or duplicate information not caught earlier), users are presented with relevant error messages.
   - **Pass**: Error handling is correctly described.
7. **Navigation:**
   - Provides a link for existing users to navigate to the login page if they already have an account.
   - **Pass**: Navigation is correctly described.

### **3. Business Objectives**

**a. User Acquisition:**
- Facilitates the onboarding of new users by providing a streamlined and validated signup process, thereby increasing the user base.
  - **Pass**: User acquisition objective is correctly described.

**b. Data Integrity:**
- Ensures that each user has a unique **Name** and **Email**, preventing duplication and maintaining the integrity of user data within the system.
  - **Pass**: Data integrity objective is correctly described.

**c. User Experience:**
- Enhances user satisfaction by providing immediate validation feedback, reducing errors, and guiding users through the signup process seamlessly.
  - **Pass**: User experience objective is correctly described.

**d. Security:**
- Enforces password strength requirements (minimum length) to enhance account security.
  - **Pass**: Security objective is correctly described.

**e. Scalability:**
- Utilizes asynchronous validation and efficient state management to handle multiple concurrent signup requests without degrading performance.
  - **Pass**: Scalability objective is correctly described.

### **4. Constraints & Assumptions**

**a. Constraints:**
- **Form Library Dependency:** Relies on **redux-form** for form state management, which may impose certain structural or performance constraints.
  - **Pass**: Form library dependency constraint is correctly described.
- **API Availability:** Assumes that the backend APIs (`api.isName`, `api.isEmail`, `api.signup`) are reliable and performant to handle validation and signup requests.
  - **Pass**: API availability constraint is correctly described.
- **Client-Side Validation:** While robust, some validations are performed client-side, assuming that server-side validations are also in place to prevent bypassing.
  - **Pass**: Client-side validation constraint is correctly described.

**b. Assumptions:**
- **Unique Identification:** Assumes that either the **Name** or **Email** is sufficient for unique user identification.
  - **Pass**: Unique identification assumption is correctly described.
- **Error Handling:** Assumes that the backend API returns error messages in a predictable format (`error.data`).
  - **Pass**: Error handling assumption is correctly described.
- **UI Framework:** Utilizes **react-bootstrap** for UI components, assuming that the application's styling and theming are consistent with Bootstrap standards.
  - **Pass**: UI framework assumption is correctly described.
- **Prop Types:** Uses `PropTypes` for type checking, assuming that all required props are correctly passed to components.
  - **Pass**: Prop types assumption is correctly described.
