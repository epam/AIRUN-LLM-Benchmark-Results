# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.
- **Pass**: All imports in the provided code are used and necessary for the functionality.

### Step 2: Ensure the codebase is structured and follows Angular style guidelines and best practices.
- **Pass**: The codebase is well-structured, with components, services, and state management properly organized.

### Step 3: Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of Angular and TypeScript.
- **Pass**: The code uses modern Angular and TypeScript features, indicating compatibility with the latest versions.

### Step 4: Verify the application works correctly across modern browsers.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include any browser compatibility checks or tests. This step cannot be verified without running the application.

### Step 5: Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include any runtime checks. This step cannot be verified without running the application.

### Step 6: Ensure the code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility.
- **Pass**: The code is decomposed into multiple components, each with a single responsibility.

### Step 7: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
- **Pass**: The code does not contain any obvious duplicates and follows DRY principles.

### Step 8: Ensure the application handles API errors.
- **Fail**: The `AuthEffects` class contains a placeholder comment for error handling (`catchError(error => of(/* handle error */))`). Proper error handling is not implemented.

### Step 9: Validate that @ngrx/store is used for state management and that the state is properly defined in auth.reducer.ts and app.state.ts.
- **Pass**: The application uses `@ngrx/store` for state management, and the state is properly defined in `auth.reducer.ts`.

### Step 10: Verify the UI and UX by running the Angular application and ensuring that the signup form behaves as expected, including form validation and error messages.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include any runtime checks. This step cannot be verified without running the application.

### Step 11: Confirm that the signup action is correctly dispatched from the SignupComponent upon form submission.
- **Pass**: The `signup` action is correctly dispatched from the `SignupComponent` upon form submission.

### Step 12: Verify app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of Angular framework.
- **Pass**: The application does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of the Angular framework.

### Step 13: Verify app does not overuse Angular references for DOM access instead of Angular state and props.
- **Pass**: The application uses Angular state and props appropriately and does not overuse Angular references for DOM access.

### Step 14: Check that there are no TODOs or incomplete parts in the code.
- **Fail**: The `AuthEffects` class contains a placeholder comment for error handling (`catchError(error => of(/* handle error */))`), indicating an incomplete part in the code.

### Summary
- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 14
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 9
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 5

Overall, the code is well-structured and follows Angular best practices, but it lacks proper error handling and runtime verification. Additionally, some steps cannot be fully verified without running the application.
