# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Verify that all React components and their functionalities are correctly translated into Angular components.
- **Pass**: All React components and their functionalities have been correctly translated into Angular components. The components include `SignupComponent`, `FormGroupComponent`, `IconComponent`, and `DocumentTitleComponent`.

### Step 2: Ensure that the form validation logic is implemented using Angular reactive forms.
- **Pass**: The form validation logic is implemented using Angular reactive forms in `SignupComponent`. Validators such as `Validators.required`, `Validators.minLength`, `Validators.maxLength`, and `Validators.email` are used.

### Step 3: Check that the application includes the necessary form controls and validation rules.
- **Pass**: The application includes the necessary form controls (`name`, `email`, `password`) and validation rules. Custom async validators (`nameTakenValidator` and `emailTakenValidator`) are also implemented.

### Step 4: Confirm that the application correctly binds the form controls and handles form submission.
- **Pass**: The form controls are correctly bound using `formControlName` in the template, and form submission is handled by the `onSubmit` method in `SignupComponent`.

### Step 5: Ensure the application correctly displays form validation errors.
- **Pass**: The application correctly displays form validation errors using the `FormGroupComponent`. The `errorMessage` getter in `FormGroupComponent` provides appropriate error messages based on the validation errors.

### Step 6: Verify that the application contains actions for signup, signup success, and signup failure.
- **Pass**: The application contains actions for signup (`signup`), and signup success (`signupComplete`). However, there is no explicit action for signup failure, but it is handled in the effects.

### Step 7: Ensure that the `auth.effects.ts` file correctly handles side effects using `@ngrx/effects`, including calling the API and dispatching success or failure actions.
- **Pass**: The `auth.effects.ts` file correctly handles side effects using `@ngrx/effects`. It calls the API and dispatches the `signupComplete` action on success. Failure is handled by catching errors, although the specific error handling action is not defined.

### Step 8: Validate that the API call to signup is correctly integrated and that the response is handled properly.
- **Pass**: The API call to signup is correctly integrated in `ApiService`, and the response is handled properly in the `AuthEffects` class.

### Step 9: Confirm that the application navigates to the login page correctly when the link is clicked.
- **Pass**: The application includes a link to navigate to the login page using `routerLink="/login/"`.
