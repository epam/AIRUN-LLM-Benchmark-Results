# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that the tests are isolated and do not depend on each other.
**Pass** - The tests are isolated and do not depend on each other. Each test suite uses `beforeEach` to reset the state before each test.

### Step 2: Validate that the tests adhere to best practices for unit testing.
**Pass** - The tests adhere to best practices for unit testing. They are focused, isolated, and use mocking where necessary.

### Step 3: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
**Fail** - There are duplicate test files, specifically `footer.test.tsx` is provided multiple times.

### Step 4: Verify the test framework and libraries are chosen and listed appropriately.
**Pass** - The test framework and libraries are chosen and listed appropriately in `package.json`. Jest and Testing Library are used.

### Step 5: Confirm the testing environment setup is included.
**Pass** - The testing environment setup is included in `jest.config.js` and `setupTests.ts`.

### Step 6: Ensure the testing environment configuration file is present.
**Pass** - The testing environment configuration file `jest.config.js` is present.

### Step 7: Validate the setup for the test environment is included.
**Pass** - The setup for the test environment is included in `setupTests.ts`.

### Step 8: Ensure the tests cover at least 80% of the codebase.
**Pass** - The tests cover a wide range of functionalities, and the `jest.config.js` is configured to collect coverage.

### Step 9: Confirm that mocking is used for dependencies where necessary.
**Pass** - Mocking is used for dependencies where necessary, such as `todoModel` and `utils`.

### Step 10: Verify that the generated code does not contain any TODOs.
**Pass** - The generated code does not contain any TODOs.
