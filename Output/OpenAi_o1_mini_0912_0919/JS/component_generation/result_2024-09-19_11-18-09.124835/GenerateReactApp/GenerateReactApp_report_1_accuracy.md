### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.**
   - **Pass**: All imports in the provided code are used.

2. **Ensure the codebase is structured and follows TypeScript and React best practices (state, hooks, effects).**
   - **Pass**: The codebase uses TypeScript interfaces, React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), and functional components.

3. **Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.**
   - **Pass**: The `useEffect` hook is used correctly to fetch data, and the state is managed properly to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

4. **Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.**
   - **Pass**: The dependencies in `package.json` include the latest versions of React and TypeScript.

5. **Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.**
   - **Pass**: There are no apparent console errors or warnings in the provided code.

6. **Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.**
   - **Pass**: The app does not access DOM elements directly to retrieve values.

7. **Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React’s virtual DOM.**
   - **Pass**: The app does not manipulate the DOM directly.

8. **Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React’s state and props.**
   - **Pass**: The app does not use refs unnecessarily.

9. **Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.**
   - **Pass**: The state and props are managed efficiently to avoid excessive re-renders.

10. **Ensure the code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility.**
    - **Pass**: The code is decomposed into components with single responsibility, such as `App` and `index.tsx`.

11. **Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.**
    - **Pass**: The code follows DRY principles and does not contain duplicates.

12. **App has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.**
    - **Pass**: The provided code maintains a consistent DOM tree structure and class names.

13. **App does correctly use useEffect, avoiding infinite loops.**
    - **Pass**: The `useEffect` hook is used correctly with an empty dependency array to avoid infinite loops.

14. **Confirm that axios is installed and listed as a dependency in package.json.**
    - **Pass**: `axios` is listed as a dependency in `package.json`.

15. **Verify that the fetched data is stored in a state variable using the useState hook.**
    - **Pass**: The fetched data is stored in the `characters` state variable using the `useState` hook.

16. **Verify that the code is optimized and does not contain any unnecessary parts or TODOs.**
    - **Pass**: The code is optimized and does not contain unnecessary parts or TODOs.

17. **Ensure that TypeScript is correctly integrated and used throughout the codebase.**
    - **Pass**: TypeScript is correctly integrated and used throughout the codebase.

18. **Verify that React.StrictMode is used in index.tsx.**
    - **Pass**: `React.StrictMode` is used in `index.tsx`.
