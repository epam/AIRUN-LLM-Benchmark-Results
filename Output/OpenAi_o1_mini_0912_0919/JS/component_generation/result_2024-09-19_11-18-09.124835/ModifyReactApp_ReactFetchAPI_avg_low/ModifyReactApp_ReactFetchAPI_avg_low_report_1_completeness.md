# Evaluation Report

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Check that a loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.**
   - **Pass**: The code includes a loading state (`loading`) and conditionally renders a loading indicator (`<div>Loading...</div>`) when `loading` is `true`.

2. **Verify that the loader does not hide the search input when data is loading.**
   - **Pass**: The search input (`<input type="text" ... />`) is always rendered regardless of the loading state.

3. **Validate that a request with an empty search term is sent on the initial render.**
   - **Pass**: On initial render, `search` and `debouncedSearch` are both empty strings, triggering a fetch request with an empty search term.

4. **Verify that the search input field is present.**
   - **Pass**: The search input field is present in the JSX (`<input type="text" ... />`).

5. **Ensure that the character search functionality is implemented.**
   - **Pass**: The search functionality is implemented using the `search` state and the `debouncedSearch` state to fetch characters based on the search term.

6. **Ensure that the API request includes the search term as a query parameter.**
   - **Pass**: The API request includes the search term as a query parameter (`params: { search: debouncedSearch }`).

7. **Validate that the data is loading on initial app load with empty query and then when the search term changes.**
   - **Pass**: The data is fetched on initial load and whenever `debouncedSearch` changes, as indicated by the `useEffect` hooks.

8. **Ensure that the debounced fetch function prevents unnecessary API requests.**
   - **Pass**: The debouncing mechanism is implemented using a `setTimeout` in the `useEffect` hook, which updates `debouncedSearch` after a delay of 300ms.

9. **Confirm that the character list is updated based on the search results.**
   - **Pass**: The character list is updated based on the search results and rendered in a `<ul>` element.

10. **Validate that the application handles API request errors.**
    - **Pass**: The application handles API request errors using a `try-catch` block and logs the error to the console.

11. **Ensure that the user experience remains smooth without backend overloads.**
    - **Pass**: The debouncing mechanism helps to prevent backend overloads by reducing the number of API requests.
