## Steps

### Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
- **Pass**: The `TodoApp` component includes an input field with a `ref` to `newFieldRef`. The `handleNewTodoKeyDown` function handles the Enter key press, dispatches the `addTodo` action, and clears the input field.

### Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
- **Pass**: The `TodoApp` component filters the todos based on the `nowShowing` state and maps over the filtered todos to display them in a list.

### Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
- **Pass**: The `TodoApp` component includes a checkbox with an `onChange` handler `handleToggleAll` that dispatches the `toggleAll` action.

### Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItem` component includes functionality to toggle (`handleToggle`), edit (`handleEdit`, `handleSubmit`, `handleKeyDown`, `handleBlur`), and delete (`handleDestroy`) a todo item.

### Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItem` component handles double-click to start editing (`handleEdit`), Enter key to submit (`handleKeyDown`), and Esc key to reset (`handleKeyDown`).

### Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFooter` component displays the count of active items, includes filter links, and a button to clear completed items.

### Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFooter` component includes a "Clear completed" button that calls the `onClearCompleted` function, which dispatches the `clearCompleted` action.
