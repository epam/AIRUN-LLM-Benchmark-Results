    - The code does not contain any browser-specific code that would limit its compatibility with modern browsers.

6. **Pass**: Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.
    - The provided code does not contain any obvious issues that would result in console errors or warnings.

7. **Pass**: Verify that the new React app initializes successfully without errors.
    - The code initializes a React app correctly, rendering the `App` component within a `StrictMode` wrapper.

8. **Pass**: Verify that the codebase does not contain any TODOs.
    - There are no TODO comments or unfinished code sections in the provided code.

9. **Pass**: Ensure the application has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.
    - The DOM structure and class names in the React components match the original HTML structure.

10. **Pass**: Verify the application UI matches the original HTML structure visually.
