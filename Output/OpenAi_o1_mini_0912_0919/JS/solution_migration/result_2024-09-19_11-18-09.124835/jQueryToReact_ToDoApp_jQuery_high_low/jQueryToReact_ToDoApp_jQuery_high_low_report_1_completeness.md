# Evaluation Report

## Steps

### Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
- **Pass**: The `Header` component contains an input field with the class `new-todo`. The `handleKeyUp` function checks if the Enter key is pressed and dispatches the `addTodo` action with the trimmed title from the state.

### Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
- **Pass**: The `TodoList` component uses the `useSelector` hook to get the `todos` and `filter` from the state. It filters the todos based on the current filter and displays them in a list.

### Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
- **Pass**: The `TodoList` component includes a checkbox with the class `toggle-all`. The `handleToggleAll` function dispatches the `toggleAll` action with the checked status of the checkbox.

### Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItem` component includes functionality to toggle the completion status, edit the title, and delete the todo. The `handleToggle`, `handleDelete`, and `handleBlur` functions dispatch the corresponding actions.

### Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItem` component starts editing on double click (`handleDoubleClick`), submits the edited title on Enter key press (`handleKeyUp`), and resets the title on Esc key press (`handleKeyUp`).

### Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
- **Pass**: The `Footer` component displays the count of active items, includes filter links, and a button to clear completed items. The `handleFilterChange` and `handleClearCompleted` functions dispatch the corresponding actions.

### Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
- **Pass**: The `Footer` component includes a button with the class `clear-completed` that dispatches the `clearCompleted` action when clicked.
