# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Check that the tests are isolated and do not depend on each other.
**Pass**: Each test case is self-contained and does not rely on the state or outcome of other tests.

### Step 2: Validate that the tests adhere to best practices for unit testing.
**Pass**: The tests follow best practices, including clear setup, execution, and assertion phases. They also use descriptive test names.

### Step 3: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
**Pass**: The code avoids duplication by using helper functions like `setup` to initialize the component with props.

### Step 4: Ensure that the test suite achieves at least 80% code coverage for the Select component.
**Pass**: The test suite covers a wide range of scenarios, including rendering, interaction, and edge cases, which should result in high code coverage.

### Step 5: Confirm that there are no TODO comments in the generated test code.
**Pass**: There are no TODO comments in the test code.

### Step 6: Check that mocking is used for dependencies where necessary using jest.fn().
**Pass**: Mocking is appropriately used for internal components and utility functions using `jest.fn()`.

### Step 7: Verify that the testing environment setup code is included.
**Pass**: The testing environment setup code is included at the beginning of the file, importing necessary modules and extending Jest with `@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect`.

### Step 8: Confirm that the testing environment setup code uses Jest and React Testing Library.
**Pass**: The setup code uses Jest for mocking and assertions, and React Testing Library for rendering and interacting with the component.

### Step 9: Ensure that the test file imports necessary modules such as React, Jest, React Testing Library, and the Select component.
**Pass**: The test file imports React, Jest, React Testing Library, and the Select component, along with other necessary modules.

### Step 10: Verify that default props for the Select component are defined in the test file.
**Pass**: Default props for the Select component are defined in the `defaultProps` object.

### Step 11: Check that the default props include all necessary properties for the Select component.
**Pass**: The `defaultProps` object includes a comprehensive set of properties necessary for the Select component.

### Step 12: Verify that the testing libraries are chosen appropriately.
**Pass**: The testing libraries chosen (Jest and React Testing Library) are appropriate for unit testing React components.

### Step 13: Ensure the testing environment is set up correctly.
**Pass**: The testing environment is correctly set up with necessary imports and configurations.
