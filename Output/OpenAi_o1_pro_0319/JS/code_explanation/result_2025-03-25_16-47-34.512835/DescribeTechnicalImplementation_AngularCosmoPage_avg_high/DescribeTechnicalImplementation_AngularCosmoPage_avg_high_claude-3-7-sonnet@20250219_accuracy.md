# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies Angular.js as the framework used
  
  The documentation consistently identifies AngularJS (1.x) as the framework used throughout the content. It correctly refers to AngularJS-specific concepts like controllers, factories, $resource, and other services specific to this framework.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all factories (REST, Page, Users) are accurately documented with their purposes
  
  The documentation provides clear and accurate descriptions of all three factories:
  - REST Factory: Described as configuring $resource endpoints for backend communication
  - Page Factory: Described as a shared object storing page-level data
  - Users Factory: Described as a shared object storing current user data

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of the Page controller and its functionality is technically accurate
  
  The documentation accurately describes pageCtrl as managing the creation and editing of pages, integrating with the Page, Users, and REST services. It correctly details the controller's various functions including saving, deleting, updating, and duplicating pages, local storage handling, URL generation, publishing, scheduling, tagging, and revision tracking.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the RESTful API endpoints are correctly documented
  
  The documentation provides a comprehensive table of all RESTful API endpoints, their paths (e.g., api/blocks/:blockID), and their purposes. The endpoints are accurately described with their respective functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of Angular module dependencies ($resource, $location, etc.) is correct
  
  The documentation correctly explains the Angular dependencies used throughout the code, including $resource for RESTful communication and $location for redirection. The explanation of these services and their usage is technically accurate.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the page management features (creating, editing, deleting) are accurately described
  
  The documentation provides detailed and accurate descriptions of page management features, including the initialization process, save and update operations, deletion logic, and handling of associated entities like revisions, extras, and tags.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately explains how the local storage mechanism works
  
  The documentation accurately describes the local storage mechanism used for saving drafts and handling unsaved changes. It correctly explains the functionality of relevant methods like localVersion(), deleteNewerVersion(), and saveLocal(), as well as the use of the $scope.newerVersion flag.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of form validation logic is technically accurate
  
  The documentation accurately explains the form validation logic, noting that it validates required fields (title, type, url) before saving, which aligns with standard AngularJS validation practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of publish/schedule date handling is correct
  
  The documentation correctly explains the publishing and scheduling functionality, including how the controller handles immediate or scheduled publishing of pages and the conditional setting of scheduleDate to the current time when creating a new page.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the tag management and autocomplete feature explanation is technically accurate
  
  The documentation provides an accurate explanation of the tag management and autocomplete features, correctly detailing how the autocompleteTags() method queries REST.contentTags for suggestions and how selectSuggestion(tag) replaces the last typed tag with the chosen suggestion.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the relationship between controllers, factories, and templates is accurately explained
  
  The documentation accurately explains how the different components interact, with the Page and Users factories providing global state that is used by pageCtrl, and how the controller interacts with the REST factory for backend communication. It also explains how these components would be used within templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation correctly identifies and explains the purpose of broadcast events
  
  The documentation correctly identifies the broadcast event 'settingsGet' in the updatePageType() method and explains its purpose in updating the Page.type from $scope.page.type.
