# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation includes a comprehensive component overview explaining the purpose and architecture
  
  The documentation provides a comprehensive component overview in Section 2 "COMPONENT OVERVIEW" that clearly explains the purpose and architecture of the system. It details each major component (REST Factory, Page Factory, Users Factory, and pageCtrl), describing their purposes, roles, and key functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all major components (REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and Page controller) are documented
  
  All four major components are thoroughly documented in Section 2, with dedicated subsections (2.1-2.4) for each component, explaining their functions and responsibilities in detail.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure all significant features of the page management system are described
  
  Section 3 "DETAILED FEATURES" comprehensively covers the significant features of the page management system, including data retrieval and storage, page management operations (initialization, local storage, save/update, delete), and theming/page types.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all form inputs and their behavior are documented
  
  The documentation explains form inputs and their behavior through the detailed description of pageCtrl properties and methods in Section 4.4. This includes descriptions of title, description, URL fields, and how they interact through methods like titleChange(), descriptionChange(), and urlChange().

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page versioning and revision system
  
  The documentation explains the versioning and revision system in multiple sections, particularly in Section 2.4 where it mentions "Revisioning: Automatically creates new revisions whenever a page is saved or updated" and in Section 3.2 where it discusses maintaining revision history via REST.contentRevisions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation covers the tag system and autocomplete functionality
  
  The tag system and autocomplete functionality are well-documented in Sections 2.4 (Key Functionality #4), 3.2 (Tag Autocomplete), and 4.4 where autocompleteTags() and selectSuggestion(tag) methods are explained.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the documentation includes explanation of error handling and user notifications
  
  The documentation touches on user notifications regarding newer versions in local storage and validation of required fields, but doesn't provide comprehensive details about error handling for all scenarios. This is implicit in some sections like 3.2 where it mentions validation and user prompts, but a dedicated section on error handling would improve completeness.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page publishing workflow including scheduling
  
  The publishing workflow and scheduling are clearly explained in Section 2.4 (Key Functionality #3) and Section 3.2. The documentation explicitly mentions handling immediate or scheduled publishing of pages and explains the published and published_date properties.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation details how content extras and additional metadata are managed
  
  The documentation explains content extras management in Section 4.2 (Page Factory Properties) where it describes the "extras" and "misc" properties. Additionally, Section 4.1 mentions contentExtras and contentRevisionsExtras REST endpoints for managing additional data linked to content items.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation explains how the UI interacts with the backend APIs
  
  The documentation thoroughly explains UI-backend interaction, particularly in Section 4.1, which provides a comprehensive table of all REST endpoints, and in Section 3.2, which details how pageCtrl interacts with these endpoints for various operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes sample usage examples or patterns
  
  Section 5 "USAGE DOCUMENTATION" provides clear sample usage examples and patterns, including example setup code, common patterns for retrieving page data, local storage auto-saving, and tagging functionality.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify the documentation explains all significant event broadcasting and inter-component communication
  
  The documentation mentions some inter-component communication, such as in Section 4.4 where it notes that updatePageType() "broadcasts 'settingsGet'" and explains how the controller interacts with the factories. However, it could be more explicit about all events broadcasted throughout the system.
