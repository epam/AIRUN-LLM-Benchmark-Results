# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies Angular.js as the framework used  
  The documentation clearly states that this is an AngularJS (1.x) application and consistently refers to its components (controllers, factories, etc.) accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all factories (REST, Page, Users) are accurately documented with their purposes  
  The documentation details the purpose and key functionality of each factory, including REST endpoints, page state management, and user data storage.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of the Page controller and its functionality is technically accurate  
  The explanation of pageCtrl covers functions like creating, editing, deleting pages, handling local storage for unsaved changes, and managing revisions, all consistent with typical AngularJS controller practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the RESTful API endpoints are correctly documented  
  The report includes a detailed table of API endpoints, HTTP methods (including custom update via PUT), and descriptions that accurately reflect their roles.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure the explanation of Angular module dependencies ($resource, $location, etc.) is correct  
  While the documentation appropriately explains the usage of Angular’s $resource for REST calls and shows how the AngularJS module is defined (e.g., angular.module('myApp', ['cosmo'])), it does not explicitly address other module dependencies such as $location or provide further explanation regarding them. This lack of detail in that area leads to a less than complete evaluation.  
  (I am 90% confident in this assessment because the main dependency ($resource) is covered, but the omission of a discussion around $location and similar dependencies leaves room for improvement.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the page management features (creating, editing, deleting) are accurately described  
  The documentation clearly describes the mechanisms for saving, updating, deleting pages, interacting with local storage, and handling revisions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately explains how the local storage mechanism works  
  There is a clear section covering how localStorage is used to check for newer unsaved versions and to persist basic page info, which aligns with typical AngularJS usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of form validation logic is technically accurate  
  The documentation mentions that required fields (such as title, type, url) are validated before saving or updating a page. Although brief, this explanation is accurate in the given context.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of publish/schedule date handling is correct  
  There is an accurate description of how publishing and scheduling work—including the immediate versus scheduled publishing, as well as setting scheduleDate—to manage page publication.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the tag management and autocomplete feature explanation is technically accurate  
  The documentation details how tag suggestions are fetched via REST.contentTags and how a partial tag is replaced with the selected suggestion, which is consistent with AngularJS practices for such functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the relationship between controllers, factories, and templates is accurately explained  
  The answer explains how the factories (Page, Users, REST) feed data into the controller (pageCtrl) and how this data is used within AngularJS templates, which is correct and cohesive.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation correctly identifies and explains the purpose of broadcast events  
  The documentation notes that the function updatePageType broadcasts a 'settingsGet' event after updating Page.type, which is a correct description of the event-driven interaction in AngularJS.
