# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The application makes an API call to 'https://swapi.dev/api/people/' using axios, fetches the character data, and displays it in an unordered list.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The application has an `isLoading` state that is set to true initially and shows a "Loading..." message while data is being fetched.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The code maps through all characters in the `characters` state array and renders each one in a list item, ensuring all fetched characters are displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  The application is a simple display of Star Wars characters without any search functionality or user input fields.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character is displayed in an `<li>` element showing the character's name (`character.name`).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The application includes the typical structure of a Create React App project, including the package.json with react-scripts, and the instructions specifically mention using Create React App.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The application uses React's useState hook to manage three state variables: characters, isLoading, and hasError, which handle the data, loading status, and error conditions appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each `<li>` element in the character list uses the character's URL as a unique key: `<li key={character.url}>`.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  The application handles loading and error states explicitly, but doesn't have specific handling for an empty array of characters. However, if the API returns an empty array, the map function would simply not render any list items, which is an acceptable approach. The 90% confidence is due to the lack of explicit empty state handling, though the current implementation would still work correctly.
