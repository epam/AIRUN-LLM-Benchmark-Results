# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The code calls the SWAPI endpoint using axios, stores the results in state, and renders a list of characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The component conditionally returns a <p>Loading...</p> element when data is being fetched.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  All characters from the API response are mapped over and rendered as list items within an unordered list.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  There is no code for search or any user input; the application solely fetches and displays data.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each character is displayed using its name property, and a unique key (character.url) is used for each list item.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The provided package.json, file structure, and use of react-scripts indicate that the project is set up using Create React App (with the TypeScript template).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The component uses React useState hooks to manage loading, error, and character data states effectively.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  Each list item uses character.url as its key, which is a unique identifier provided by the API.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  The code does not implement a specific empty state message. If the API returns an empty list, the UI will display an empty list under the header. Although the application does not crash and correctly handles the loading and error states, it could be improved with a user-friendly message to indicate that no characters were found. This slight omission leads to a slightly reduced confidence level.
