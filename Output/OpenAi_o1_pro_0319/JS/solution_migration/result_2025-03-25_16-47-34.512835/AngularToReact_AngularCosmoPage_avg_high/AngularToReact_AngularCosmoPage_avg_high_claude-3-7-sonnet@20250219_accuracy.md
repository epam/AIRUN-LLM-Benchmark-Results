# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props
  
  The solution demonstrates TypeScript usage with explicit typing throughout the code. Interfaces are defined for data models (IPage, IUser), component props (PageEditProps), and state types (PageState). Function parameters and return types are properly typed, as seen in hooks like useLocalStorage<T> and components like `const PageEdit: React.FC<PageEditProps>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management
  
  The solution clearly uses Redux Toolkit's createSlice for state management, as shown in the pageSlice.ts file. The code includes createSlice, createAsyncThunk, and proper setup with configureStore.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components
  
  All components in the solution are implemented as functional components using the React.FC type annotation, such as `const PageEdit: React.FC<PageEditProps>` and `const AppRoutes: React.FC`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately
  
  The solution demonstrates proper usage of React hooks throughout the code. useState is used for form state management, useEffect for side effects like data fetching and updates, and useCallback for memoizing functions. The hooks follow React rules with proper dependency arrays.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource
  
  The solution replaces Angular's $resource with fetch API calls, as shown in the pageApi.ts file with functions like fetchPage and createPage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components
  
  The PageEdit component demonstrates the use of controlled components for form handling, with input values tied to state variables and onChange handlers updating the state, as seen in fields for title, description, tags, etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation
  
  The solution implements React Router v6 with BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route components in the routes/index.tsx file. It includes route parameters like :url and navigation using the useNavigate hook.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization
  
  The solution uses react-i18next for internationalization, with proper setup in i18n/index.ts and usage through the useTranslation hook in components.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization
  
  The solution mentions code splitting using React.lazy and Suspense in the "Optimizations & Further Refinements" section, though it doesn't provide explicit code examples of this implementation.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations
  
  React.memo is mentioned in the "Optimizations & Further Refinements" section as a recommended practice for memoizing expensive child components, though specific examples are not provided in the code snippets.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks
  
  The solution demonstrates proper dependency arrays in useEffect hooks, as seen in the data fetching effect with [dispatch, isNew, url] dependencies and the form population effect with [currentPage, isNew].

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models
  
  The solution provides clear TypeScript interfaces for data models, including IPage, IPageExtras, IUser, and state interfaces like PageState.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state
  
  The solution implements and uses Redux selectors like selectCurrentPage, selectPageStatus, and selectPageError for accessing state in a reusable way.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations
  
  The solution includes both synchronous action creators (clearPage, setPage) exported from the slice and asynchronous actions via createAsyncThunk (fetchPageThunk, createPageThunk).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks
  
  The solution implements a custom useLocalStorage hook that properly handles reading from and writing to localStorage, with appropriate error handling and type safety.
