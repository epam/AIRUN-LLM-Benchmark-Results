# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented

    The implementation includes create and update functionality through the `createPageThunk` and the example handlers in the `PageEdit.tsx` component. However, delete and duplicate functionality are notably missing from the provided code snippets. The implementation mentions you can add these handlers, but does not actually show them:
    
    ```
    You can replicate all the logic from pageCtrl (e.g. checking local storage for unsaved versions, deleting a page, discarding, duplicating, etc.) by adding more handlers and hooking them into your Redux slice or local states.
    ```

    My confidence is 90% because while the code includes many core page management functions, it explicitly acknowledges that delete and duplicate functionality would need to be added later.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present

    The example code doesn't include any implementation for page type selection. The `IPage` interface has a `type` field, but there is no UI component or state management for selecting page types in the provided `PageEdit` component.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists

    There is no implementation of URL auto-generation from title. The code mentions URL fields in interfaces and uses URL parameters, but doesn't show any logic for automatically generating a URL based on the title input.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented

    The code includes tag management through the input field in the `PageEdit` component:

    ```jsx
    <label>{t('tags')}</label>
    <input
      type="text"
      value={tags.join(', ')}
      onChange={e => setTags(e.target.value.split(',').map(tag => tag.trim()))}
    />
    ```

    This implementation properly handles the conversion between a string representation and an array of tags.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available

    The code clearly implements the publish status options with radio buttons for "publish", "draft", and "schedule":

    ```jsx
    <div>
      <label>
        <input
          type="radio"
          checked={publish === 'Y'}
          onChange={() => setPublish('Y')}
        />
        {t('publish')}
      </label>
      <label>
        <input
          type="radio"
          checked={publish === 'N'}
          onChange={() => setPublish('N')}
        />
        {t('draft')}
      </label>
      <label>
        <input
          type="radio"
          checked={publish === 'schedule'}
          onChange={() => setPublish('schedule')}
        />
        {t('schedule')}
      </label>
    </div>
    ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented

    The code properly implements scheduled publishing date functionality with conditional rendering when "schedule" is selected:

    ```jsx
    {publish === 'schedule' && (
      <input
        type="datetime-local"
        value={
          scheduleDate
            ? `${scheduleDate.toISOString().slice(0, 16)}`
            : ''
        }
        onChange={(e) =>
          setScheduleDate(e.target.value ? new Date(e.target.value) : null)
        }
      />
    )}
    ```

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present

    The implementation includes a `useLocalStorage` hook and shows examples of using it to store edits:

    ```jsx
    const [localTitle, setLocalTitle] = useLocalStorage<string>(`${url}-title`, '');
    
    // For local storage & "newer version" detection
    useEffect(() => {
      // Example: store the title in local storage on title change
      setLocalTitle(title);
    }, [title, setLocalTitle]);
    ```

    However, while the infrastructure for local storage is in place, the actual comparison logic and UI for restoration is not fully fleshed out. The code mentions "newer version checks" but doesn't fully implement the comparison and restoration UI.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages
