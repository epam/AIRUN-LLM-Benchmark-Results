# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props  
  The provided answer includes TypeScript interfaces (e.g., IPage, IUser) and uses functional components with type annotations (e.g., React.FC). Although it does not explicitly mention enforcing strict typing for every variable or prop (which depends on the project's tsconfig settings), the code samples adhere to TypeScript best practices.  
     
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management  
  The answer demonstrates the use of Redux Toolkit’s createSlice to manage state (see pageSlice.ts) and includes async thunks for side effects.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components  
  All UI components (such as PageEdit and AppRoutes) are implemented as functional components instead of class components.  

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately  
  The code uses useState, useEffect, and useCallback correctly. Although useMemo is mentioned in the evaluation step, it is not explicitly shown in the sample. However, given the context, its absence does not significantly impact the overall appropriate use of hooks.  

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource  
  The answer includes examples using fetch for API calls (see pageApi.ts), which replaces Angular’s $resource mechanism.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components  
  The provided PageEdit component uses controlled components (with value and onChange props for inputs and textarea) to manage form state.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation  
  The code demonstrates the usage of React Router v6 (BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route) for navigation.  

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization  
  The answer replaces Angular’s $translate with react-i18next, setting up translations and usage via the useTranslation hook.  

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization  
  Although code splitting is mentioned as an optimization strategy, none of the provided code samples demonstrate the use of React.lazy, Suspense, or dynamic imports to implement code splitting.  

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations  
  There is no example showing the use of React.memo to optimize expensive component renders. The answer does not include any demonstration of memoization in components that would benefit from it.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks  
  The useEffect and useCallback hooks include appropriate dependency arrays (e.g., [dispatch, isNew, url] for page fetching, and [title, setLocalTitle] for local storage updates), ensuring correct hook behavior.  

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models  
  Interfaces for data models such as IPage and IUser are clearly defined, reflecting the underlying data structure used in the application.  

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state  
  The answer includes Redux selectors (e.g., selectCurrentPage, selectPageStatus, selectPageError) to access state slices, ensuring modular and encapsulated state access.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations  
  Action creators (like clearPage and setPage) are defined within the Redux slice to handle state mutations in a controlled manner.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks  
  The answer provides a custom useLocalStorage hook to encapsulate local storage functionality, which is then used within the PageEdit component.
