# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
  The answer only provides a create page thunk and a mechanism to fetch and set page data in the PageEdit component. Functionality for updating, deleting, and duplicating pages is either mentioned as a possibility or omitted.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
  While the IPage interface includes a "type" field, the provided component and examples do not include any UI or logic to select or manage different page types.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
  There is no implementation or logic shown that automatically generates a URL from the page title.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
  The example implements tag input as a simple comma-separated input without any autocomplete suggestion capabilities.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
  The component provides radio buttons for 'Y' (publish), 'N' (draft), and 'schedule', covering the publish status options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
  The code includes a datetime-local input that is conditionally rendered when the publish status is set to 'schedule', with proper conversion and handling of the schedule date.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
  Although a custom useLocalStorage hook is provided and used to store the title, there is no explicit implementation for comparing versions or restoring data from local storage. The answer hints at local storage usage but does not fully implement version comparison or restoration logic.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
  The code uses a try/catch with console.error for error handling, and does not include a user-facing notification system for informing success or error states.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
  There is no explicit form validation logic for required fields such as URL or page type; the example relies on simple state updates without validation.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
  Only the fetchPage and createPage API endpoints are implemented. Other endpoints (such as update, delete, etc.) are mentioned as potential additions but are not provided.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
  Although the IPage interface defines an extras field, there is no code demonstrating how extras are managed or manipulated.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
  There is no implementation of any revision history or version tracking feature in the provided migration example.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
  The provided project structure clearly separates features, hooks, and UI components with a modular organization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
  The answer includes a configuration for react-i18next and shows proper usage of the useTranslation hook within components, ensuring translation functionality is maintained.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
  The routing setup with React Router reflects the original Angular route structure (e.g., using /new, /:url, etc.), which preserves the URL structure and parameter usage.
