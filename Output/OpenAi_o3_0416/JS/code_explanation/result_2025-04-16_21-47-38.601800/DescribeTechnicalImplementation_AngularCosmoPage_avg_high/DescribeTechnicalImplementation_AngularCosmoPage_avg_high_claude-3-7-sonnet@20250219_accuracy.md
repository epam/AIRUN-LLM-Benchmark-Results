# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies Angular.js as the framework used
  
  The documentation clearly identifies AngularJS 1.x as the framework used for the Page Editor Module in the header section.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all factories (REST, Page, Users) are accurately documented with their purposes
  
  The documentation thoroughly describes all three factories with their purposes:
  - REST factory: "strongly-typed wrappers around the backend's RESTful API"
  - Page factory: "an in-memory singleton that represents the page currently being edited"
  - Users factory: "runtime information about the logged-in author"

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of the Page controller and its functionality is technically accurate
  
  The documentation accurately describes the pageCtrl as a "controller that wires the view (page.html) to the REST layer, adds local-storage recovery, tag auto-complete, revision handling and publish scheduling." The functionality is further detailed in section 3.4 with specific methods and their purposes.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the RESTful API endpoints are correctly documented
  
  Section 3.1 provides a detailed table of REST Factory resources with routes, parameters, custom methods, and typical calls. The documentation lists endpoints such as "api/content/:contentID", "api/content/:contentID/extras/", etc., which appear to follow RESTful conventions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of Angular module dependencies ($resource, $location, etc.) is correct
  
  The documentation correctly identifies Angular module dependencies in section 4.1, showing 'ngResource' and 'pascalprecht.translate' as dependencies and demonstrating their configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the page management features (creating, editing, deleting) are accurately described
  
  The documentation accurately describes page management features in section 2 (Feature List & Implementation) under point 1 "CRUD & Versioning" and throughout the document, particularly in the methods exposed by pageCtrl in section 3.4.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately explains how the local storage mechanism works
  
  Section 2, point 4 "Local-storage Recovery" clearly explains the local storage mechanism:
  - "All critical fields are cached on every saveLocal() call"
  - "At controller init a diff with server values raises newerVersion flag"
  - "localVersion()/deleteNewerVersion() restore or discard the cached copy"

- **Pass** (95%): Check that the description of form validation logic is technically accurate
  
  The documentation mentions validation in section 2, point 2: "Validation prevents back-dating unless explicitly published." While this appears technically accurate, the documentation could include more details about other validation rules. The 95% confidence reflects this slight limitation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of publish/schedule date handling is correct
  
  Section 2, point 2 "Draft / Publish / Schedule" accurately explains how scheduling converts "the chosen datetime-local value to a Unix epoch (sec) sent as published_date" and mentions validation for back-dating.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the tag management and autocomplete feature explanation is technically accurate
  
  Section 2, point 5 "Tag Autocomplete" accurately describes the feature with specific technical details about ng-list binding, querying REST.contentTags with partial matches, and the mechanism for selecting suggestions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the relationship between controllers, factories, and templates is accurately explained
  
  The document clearly explains the architecture in the Component Overview section, including a diagram that shows how page.html interacts with pageCtrl.js through DOM, and how pageCtrl.js interacts with the REST factory through $rs. The details are further elaborated throughout the document.

- **Pass** (90%): Check that the documentation correctly identifies and explains the purpose of broadcast events
  
  The documentation mentions broadcast events in section 2, point 7 "Notifications & i18n" stating that "All user feedback is broadcast through 'notify' events" and in section 6 Best Practices: "Always broadcast 'contentGet' after external changes to keep the editor in sync." However, it doesn't provide a comprehensive list of all possible broadcast events, hence the 90% confidence.
