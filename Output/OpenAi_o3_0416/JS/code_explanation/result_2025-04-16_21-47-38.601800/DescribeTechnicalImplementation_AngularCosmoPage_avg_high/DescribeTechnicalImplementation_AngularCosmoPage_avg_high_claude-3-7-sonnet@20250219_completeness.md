# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation includes a comprehensive component overview explaining the purpose and architecture
  
  The documentation begins with a clear "Component Overview" section that explains the purpose of the Page-Editor module (letting administrators create, edit, duplicate, schedule and delete pages) and details its architecture. It lists the key components and shows the architectural relationship with a diagram.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all major components (REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and Page controller) are documented
  
  All major components are documented in the overview and detailed further in subsequent sections:
  - REST factory (rest.js)
  - Page factory (page.js)
  - Users factory (users.js)
  - pageCtrl (pageCtrl.js)
  - page.html template

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure all significant features of the page management system are described
  
  Section 2 "Feature List & Implementation" comprehensively lists and describes seven major features:
  - CRUD & Versioning
  - Draft / Publish / Schedule
  - Auto URL Slugging
  - Local-storage Recovery
  - Tag Autocomplete
  - Extras (arbitrary meta)
  - Notifications & i18n

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all form inputs and their behavior are documented
  
  Form inputs and their behaviors are documented across several sections, particularly in the "Feature List & Implementation" section and the "pageCtrl Public API" subsection (3.4), which details methods that handle form interactions like `titleChange()`, `descriptionChange()`, `urlChange()`, etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page versioning and revision system
  
  The versioning and revision system is explained in section 2.1 (CRUD & Versioning), which details how revisions are stored via REST endpoints. The interfaces section also documents the relevant REST endpoints for content revisions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation covers the tag system and autocomplete functionality
  
  Section 2.5 specifically addresses "Tag Autocomplete" functionality, explaining how it splits comma-separated tags, offers autocompletion suggestions, and allows selection from those suggestions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes explanation of error handling and user notifications
  
  Section 2.7 covers "Notifications & i18n," explaining that user feedback is broadcast through 'notify' events and translated. It lists example translation keys including error messages like 'page_error_saving'.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page publishing workflow including scheduling
  
  Section 2.2 "Draft / Publish / Schedule" details the publishing workflow, including the UI controls (radio buttons), scheduling functionality, and validation to prevent back-dating.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation details how content extras and additional metadata are managed
  
  Section 2.6 "Extras (arbitrary meta)" explains how Page.extras works as a free-form object for storing metadata, how complex objects are handled, and where extras are stored in the API.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation explains how the UI interacts with the backend APIs
  
  The documentation provides a detailed REST Factory interface in section 3.1, showing all routes, parameters, and custom methods. The architectural diagram in section 1 also visually represents this interaction.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes sample usage examples or patterns
  
  Section 4 "Usage & Integration" provides code examples for:
  - Module bootstrap
  - Routing setup
  - Embedding the editor
  - Programmatic use of REST
  - Initialization requirements

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains all significant event broadcasting and inter-component communication
  
  The documentation mentions event broadcasting in several sections:
  - Section 2.7 explains 'notify' events for user feedback
  - Section 3.4 mentions broadcasting 'settingsGet'
  - Section 6 advises to "Always broadcast 'contentGet' after external changes to keep the editor in sync"
