# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies Angular.js as the framework used  
  The documentation clearly states “Framework: AngularJS 1.x”, which unambiguously identifies the framework.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all factories (REST, Page, Users) are accurately documented with their purposes  
  The REST factory, Page factory, and Users factory are each detailed with their endpoints, parameters, and overall purpose.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of the Page controller and its functionality is technically accurate  
  The documentation lists the public API of the page controller (pageCtrl) along with clear explanations of its methods, matching its intended responsibilities.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the RESTful API endpoints are correctly documented  
  The endpoints, their routes, parameters, and custom methods are documented in a table and are consistent with common AngularJS $resource usage.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure that the explanation of Angular module dependencies ($resource, $location, etc.) is correct  
  The documentation correctly includes dependencies such as AngularJS, angular-resource, and angular-translate. However, it does not mention $location (or the ngRoute module) explicitly, even though routing is demonstrated. This omission leads to slight incompleteness.  
  (I am 90% confident in this assessment because while the essential dependencies are noted, the absence of a mention for $location/ngRoute creates ambiguity relative to the evaluation step’s criteria.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the page management features (creating, editing, deleting) are accurately described  
  The documentation explains CRUD operations, versioning, and even duplicate handling in a clear manner.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately explains how the local storage mechanism works  
  Local‑storage Recovery is described in detail, explaining both caching (saveLocal) and recovery (localVersion/deleteNewerVersion) mechanisms.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of form validation logic is technically accurate  
  The document notes that validation prevents back‑dating unless explicitly published, which is consistent with common form validation practices for such features.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of publish/schedule date handling is correct  
  The handling of datetime‑local conversion to a Unix epoch and the scheduling mechanism are clearly and accurately described.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the tag management and autocomplete feature explanation is technically accurate  
  The documentation outlines the working of auto URL-slugging, autocompleteTags(), and selectSuggestion() clearly, matching the expected behavior for such features.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the relationship between controllers, factories, and templates is accurately explained  
  The given flow diagram and descriptions properly detail how page.html, pageCtrl.js, and the REST factory interact.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation correctly identifies and explains the purpose of broadcast events  
  The “Notifications & i18n” section explains the use of broadcast events (e.g., for user feedback and synchronization) clearly.
