# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation includes a comprehensive component overview explaining the purpose and architecture  
  The documentation begins with a detailed "Component Overview" that explains how the Page‑Editor module supports page creation, editing, scheduling, etc., and includes an architectural diagram and description of the module’s components.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all major components (REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and Page controller) are documented  
  All major components are clearly described, with sections listing the REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and the pageCtrl (Page controller), including their roles and interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure all significant features of the page management system are described  
  The document thoroughly covers features such as CRUD & Versioning, Draft/Publish/Schedule, auto URL slugging, local‑storage recovery, tag autocomplete, extras handling, notifications, and i18n.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all form inputs and their behavior are documented  
  The documentation explains the behavior of form elements—for example, it describes radio buttons for publication status, the tag autocomplete input, and how inputs are tied to the controller via the page.html template.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page versioning and revision system  
  The revision system is addressed in the "CRUD & Versioning" section, explaining how revisions are stored and maintained as part of the page lifecycle.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation covers the tag system and autocomplete functionality  
  A dedicated section ("Tag Autocomplete") details how comma‑separated tags are processed, autosuggestions are provided, and tokens are replaced, clearly covering the tag system.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the documentation includes explanation of error handling and user notifications  
  The document explains that all user feedback is broadcast through ‘notify’ events and translated with angular‑translate. However, while notifications are well covered, the explanation of broader error handling is somewhat brief. This step is rated at 90% because additional details on error recovery could further improve the documentation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page publishing workflow including scheduling  
  The "Draft / Publish / Schedule" section explains the workflow, including the use of radio buttons, the conversion of datetime‑local values to Unix epoch timestamps, and validations concerning scheduling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation details how content extras and additional metadata are managed  
  The section "Extras (arbitrary meta)" explains how extras are processed, stored, and stringified when needed, covering the management of additional metadata.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation explains how the UI interacts with the backend APIs  
  The documentation includes an architectural diagram, detailed REST factory routes, and even a code example (duplicatePage function) that demonstrates the interaction between the UI (page.html/pageCtrl) and the backend APIs.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes sample usage examples or patterns  
  Multiple code excerpts are provided, including module bootstrap, routing configuration, and programmatic API usage, serving as clear usage examples.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the documentation explains all significant event broadcasting and inter-component communication  
  The document mentions event broadcasting (e.g., ‘notify’ events) as well as best practices for keeping components in sync (broadcasting 'contentGet'). While these topics are covered, further elaboration on inter-component communication could add more depth. Hence, this evaluation is at 90%.
