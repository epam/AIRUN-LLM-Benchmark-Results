  - All implemented inside a well-structured handleKeyDown function

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions
  
  The component uses useRef appropriately for:
  - rootRef for the main component container
  - inputRef for the search input
  - listboxId for accessibility purposes
  
  DOM interactions are handled properly, avoiding direct DOM manipulation and using React's event system.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques
  
  The component demonstrates proper focus management:
