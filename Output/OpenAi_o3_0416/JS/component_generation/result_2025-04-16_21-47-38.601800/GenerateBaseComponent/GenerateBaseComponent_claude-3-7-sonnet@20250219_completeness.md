# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element
  
  The component renders a dropdown select UI element with a main container div that has `role="combobox"` and contains both the selected value display and a conditional dropdown section when opened.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown
  
  The component includes a search input within the dropdown that is rendered when `isOpen` is true. This input has `role="searchbox"` and is connected to the search state via value and onChange handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown
  
  The component maintains a selected value through either controlled (via `value` prop) or uncontrolled (via `internalValue` state) mode, and renders the selected option's label in the value display area.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys
  
  The component handles keyboard navigation with arrow keys in the `handleKeyDown` function. UP/DOWN arrows adjust the `highlighted` state which determines the currently focused option in the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key
  
  The Enter key functionality is implemented in the `handleKeyDown` function. When the dropdown is open and an item is highlighted, pressing Enter calls the `commit` function which selects the highlighted option.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused
  
  The `handleKeyDown` function handles Enter key presses when the component is focused but closed, calling the `open` function to display the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes
  
  In the `close` function, there's a call to `rootRef.current?.focus()` which focuses the main component after closing the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click
  
  The click handler on each option calls the `commit` function, which in turn calls `close()` after setting the selected value and triggering the onChange callback.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard
  
  The Enter key handler for selecting an item calls the `commit` function, which also calls `close()` after setting the value.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed
  
  The Escape key handling is implemented in the `handleKeyDown` function, which calls `close()` when the ESC key is pressed and the dropdown is open.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component
  
  An event listener for `mousedown` on the window is added when the dropdown is open, which checks if the click occurred outside the component (using the rootRef) and calls `close()` if so.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused
  
  The `handleKeyDown` function handles Enter key presses when the component is focused and closed, calling the `open` function to display the dropdown.
