# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  The code imports React and uses hooks and the FC type in a manner consistent with React 18. No deprecated patterns for prior versions are present.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  The component is fully typed. It defines interfaces for its props and options, and the function component is typed with FC<SearchableSelectProps>.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  Both the component code and the corresponding CSS file (index.css) are provided to handle styling.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  The code is well-organized, clearly commented with section dividers, and contains no leftover TODO comments.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  The component manages state (dropdown open/close, selected value, search text, highlighted index) using appropriate useState hooks as expected in controlled/uncontrolled patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  The component accepts various props (options, value, defaultValue, placeholder, onChange, disabled, className), enabling both controlled and uncontrolled usage, making it highly reusable.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  Keyboard events such as Enter, Escape, ArrowUp, and ArrowDown are all handled to allow opening/closing the dropdown and navigating/selecting options.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  Refs are used to manage focus (with inputRef and rootRef) and to prevent unnecessary re-renders via useMemo for filtering options. The use of refs is handled correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  The focus is correctly managed â€“ the search field receives focus when the dropdown opens, and focus is returned to the root element when the dropdown closes. Additionally, a mouse click outside the component triggers closing.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  The component has ARIA roles such as combobox, listbox, and uses aria-expanded, aria-controls, and aria-selected, making it accessible and compliant with best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  A review of the code indicates there are no obvious errors or patterns that would trigger console warnings.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  The code uses useMemo to optimize the filtering process and manages state updates in a controlled manner, minimizing unnecessary re-renders.
