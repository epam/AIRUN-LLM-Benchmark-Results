# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component returns a container div with the class "searchable-select" and renders a dropdown element conditionally, confirming that a dropdown select UI element is rendered.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  The component includes an input element with role "searchbox" inside the dropdown, which satisfies the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The implementation uses a single internal or controlled value to track selection, allowing the user to select one item only.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The onKeyDown event handler correctly processes ArrowUp and ArrowDown keys to update the highlighted index.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  When Enter is pressed while the dropdown is open, the highlighted option is committed (selected) via the commit function.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  The keydown handler opens the dropdown on an Enter key press if it is not already open, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  The close function calls rootRef.current?.focus(), ensuring that focus is restored to the select component after the dropdown closes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  The onClick handler on each option calls the commit function, which in turn calls close(), hence closing the dropdown upon selection by mouse click.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  Keyboard selection through the Enter key triggers the commit function that calls close(), ensuring the dropdown is closed after selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  The keydown event handler captures the Escape key and calls close(), which properly dismisses the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  A useEffect hook adds a mousedown event listener to the window that triggers close() when a click is detected outside the component, meeting this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  When the component is focused and the Enter key is pressed while the dropdown is closed, the open() method is invoked, which opens the dropdown.
