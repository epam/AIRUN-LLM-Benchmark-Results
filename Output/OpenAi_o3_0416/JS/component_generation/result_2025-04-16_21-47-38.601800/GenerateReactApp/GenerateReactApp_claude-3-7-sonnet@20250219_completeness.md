# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The application fetches Star Wars character data from the SWAPI API (https://swapi.dev/api/people) using axios and renders it using the CharacterList component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The application includes a loading state that displays a "Loading..." message when `loading` is true, which is set during API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The CharacterList component maps through all characters in the `characters` array and renders each one in a list item.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  There are no search inputs or user input fields in the provided code - it simply fetches and displays the characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  The CharacterList component renders each character's name inside a list item: `<li key={url}>{name}</li>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The application uses Create React App as evidenced by the file structure, dependency on react-scripts, and the instructions that mention "npx create-react-app swapi-characters --template typescript".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The App component uses useState hooks to manage loading, error, and characters states, with appropriate logic to update them during different phases of the API call.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each character list item uses the character's URL as a unique key: `<li key={url}>{name}</li>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  If the API call fails, the application shows an error message. If there are no characters (empty array), the CharacterList component would render an empty list, which is appropriate behavior.
