# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses React 18.x or newer by checking the package.json dependencies  
  The package.json lists "react": "^18.2.0", confirming that React 18.x is in use.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that TypeScript is properly implemented with appropriate type definitions for all components, props, and states  
  The codebase uses TypeScript throughout with well-defined interfaces and prop types (e.g., in swapi.ts and in components such as CharacterList).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Axios is used for API requests to fetch data from the Star Wars API endpoint  
  Axios is imported and used in App.tsx to make the GET request to the API.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles API errors gracefully with appropriate error states or messages  
  The try-catch block in the fetchCharacters function sets an error state and displays a message ("Failed to load characters.") upon encountering an error, while also handling cancellations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the character data is fetched on component mount using useEffect hook  
  The useEffect hook calls fetchCharacters on component mount by creating an AbortController and passing its signal.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application properly manages component rendering optimization  
  The CharacterList component is wrapped with React.memo, ensuring that unnecessary re-renders are avoided based on props changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows React best practices using hooks appropriately  
  Hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useCallback are employed correctly to manage state, side effects, and memoize functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't contain any TODO comments or unnecessary code  
  The code is clean and free from TODO comments or superfluous statements.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the codebase has minimal comments that only clarify complex logic when necessary  
  There are few comments, and they are reserved for non-obvious parts. The code is self-explanatory and adheres to best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the API endpoint 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' is being called correctly  
  The API URL is clearly defined and used as intended in the axios.get call.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application renders without console errors or warnings  
  Based on the provided code and standard practices, it is reasonable to conclude that the application renders correctly without console errors or warnings.
