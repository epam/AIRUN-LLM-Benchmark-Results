# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The application fetches data from https://swapi.dev/api/people and passes the results to the CharacterList component, which renders a list of character names.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  When the API call is in progress, the component renders a <div className="loader">Loading...</div>, which serves as a visual loading indicator.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  All characters received in the API response (via the data.results array) are stored in state and then mapped over to render list items in the CharacterList component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  The code is minimal and focused on data fetching and displaying; there are no search or form input elements present.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Within the CharacterList, each character is rendered as an <li> displaying the character’s name, ensuring proper display.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The provided file tree and instructions (using “npx create-react-app … --template typescript”) confirm that the application is scaffolded using Create React App.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The App component uses useState hooks to manage loading, error, and characters. It properly updates and renders different states based on the API call progress.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  In CharacterList, each <li> element is assigned a key from the character’s URL, which serves as a unique identifier.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  The application does not include explicit handling or messaging for the case when the characters array is empty. While rendering an empty <ul> does not cause an error, a more informative “no data” message is typically expected for robust handling of empty data states.  
  (Confidence is 90% because in some minimal apps an empty list might be acceptable; however, according to the evaluation step, explicit handling is expected.)
