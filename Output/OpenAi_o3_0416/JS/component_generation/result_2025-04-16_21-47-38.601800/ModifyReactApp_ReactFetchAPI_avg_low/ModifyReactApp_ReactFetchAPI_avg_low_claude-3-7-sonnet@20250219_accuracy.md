# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type
  
  The implementation uses a controlled input component with `value={search}` and `onChange={handleInput}`, where the handler correctly updates the state with `setSearch(e.target.value)`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls
  
  The code implements a custom `useDebounce` hook with a default delay of 400ms, which is within the 300-500ms range specified. The debounced value is then used to trigger API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured
  
  Axios is imported and used for making GET requests to the SWAPI API. The implementation includes proper error handling and type casting with `AxiosError`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses
  
  The code uses TypeScript throughout with appropriate interfaces for `Character`, `SwapiResponse`, and proper type annotations for all functions, state variables, and component props.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters
  
  The URL construction in `fetchCharacters` correctly appends the search parameter when a query is provided: ``https://swapi.dev/api/people${query ? `?search=${encodeURIComponent(query)}` : ''}``

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate
  
  The code uses `useCallback` for the `fetchCharacters` function and `handleInput` event handler, and `useMemo` for conditionally rendering different UI states based on loading, error, or data.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback
  
  The code implements a try-catch block in the `fetchCharacters` function, sets error messages in state, and displays them to users with appropriate styling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing
  
  The implementation uses the debounced search term as a dependency in the useEffect hook that triggers API calls, ensuring requests are only made after the user stops typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices
  
  The code follows React best practices by using appropriate hooks for state management (`useState`), side effects (`useEffect`), and memoization (`useMemo`, `useCallback`).

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code
  
  The code appears clean, without unused imports or commented-out code. All imports are used appropriately in the implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests
  
  Loading state is toggled appropriately at the beginning and end of API requests (with the `finally` block ensuring it's set to false even if errors occur), and used to conditionally render a loading indicator.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns
  
  The code uses modern React patterns compatible with React 18.x, including functional components, hooks, and proper error boundaries.
