# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name
  
  The code clearly includes an input field with the className "search" that captures user input and filters characters by name. The input has a placeholder "Search by name…" and is properly connected to the state via the onChange handler.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests
  
  The application displays a loading indicator with the text "Loading…" when the loading state is true. This is handled in the body useMemo section and shows during API requests.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query
  
  Initial data loading is properly implemented. The useEffect hook calls fetchCharacters with the debouncedSearch value when the component mounts, and since the initial search state is an empty string, it performs an empty search query.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type
  
  The code implements a debounce mechanism using the useDebounce custom hook that ensures search results update dynamically as users type, but with an appropriate delay (default 400ms) to prevent excessive API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found
  
  When no characters are found (empty array), the application displays "No results found" as visual feedback to the user, handled in the body useMemo section.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design
  
  The CharacterList.css file includes responsive design elements, with a media query for screens with a minimum width of 768px that adjusts padding. The general styling (max-width, percentage-based widths) also supports responsiveness.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response
  
  The character list is properly displayed after the API response in a ul element with the className "character-list". Each character is rendered as a list item with the character's name.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed
  
  The solution includes a separate ErrorBoundary component that catches JavaScript errors, logs them, and displays a fallback UI. The usage example also shows how to wrap the CharacterList component with this ErrorBoundary.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props
  
  TypeScript interfaces are properly defined for the Character type, SwapiResponse, and for the ErrorBoundary component's Props and State. The code also includes type annotations throughout, including for event handlers and state variables.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities
  
  The code maintains the original functionality of displaying Star Wars characters while adding search capabilities. It preserves the API structure, supports the original character list display, and adds robust error handling, loading states, and search functionality without changing the public API of the component tree.
