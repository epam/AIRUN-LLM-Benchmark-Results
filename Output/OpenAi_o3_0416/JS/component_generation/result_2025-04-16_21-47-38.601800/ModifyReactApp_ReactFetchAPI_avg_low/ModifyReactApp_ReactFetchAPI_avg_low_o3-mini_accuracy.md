# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type  
  The input element is bound to the state variable "search" and is updated via the onChange handler "handleInput", which calls setSearch with the current value from the event.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls  
  The custom hook "useDebounce" is correctly implemented with a default delay of 400ms, which lies within the specified range.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured  
  Axios is imported and used within an async function "fetchCharacters". The API request configuration is handled correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses  
  All components, functions, hooks, and API responses (e.g., "SwapiResponse" and "Character") are strongly typed and utilize TypeScript features effectively.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters  
  The URL is conditionally constructed to append "?search=" with an encoded query parameter only when a non-empty search term is provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate  
  The code utilizes useCallback for "fetchCharacters" and "handleInput", and useMemo for memoizing the rendered body, which helps in performance optimization by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback  
  The try/catch block in the "fetchCharacters" function handles API errors gracefully by capturing the error message and updating an "errorMsg" state that informs the user.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing  
  The integration of the "useDebounce" hook with the search state ensures that API calls are made only after the user stops typing for 400ms.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices  
  State is managed using React's useState hook for search queries, loading indicators, error messages, and the results list. The management is clear and consistent with best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code  
  The provided code is clean, with all imports in use and no leftover commented-out code. The ErrorBoundary component also includes error logging in componentDidCatch.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests  
  The loading state is set to true when a request starts and is properly reset in the finally block of the API call, ensuring accurate feedback during the data fetching process.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns  
  The usage of createRoot from "react-dom/client" for rendering along with React.StrictMode confirms adherence to React 18 patterns.
