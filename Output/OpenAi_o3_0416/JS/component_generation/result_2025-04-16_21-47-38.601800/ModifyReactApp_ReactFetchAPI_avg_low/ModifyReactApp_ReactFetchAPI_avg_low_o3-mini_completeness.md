# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The code contains an input element with the class "search" and an onChange handler (handleInput), which is used to update the search query for filtering the characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  The component renders a div with the text "Loadingâ€¦" when the loading state is true, ensuring users see visual feedback during API requests.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  On initial mount, the useEffect hook calls fetchCharacters with the debounced search value (initially an empty string), triggering the initial API call.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  The component uses a debounced input (via useDebounce) and an onChange handler to update the search term, which in turn triggers the API call to update the character list dynamically.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  When there are no characters in the results, the component renders a div with the text "No results found", providing clear feedback to the user.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The provided CSS includes responsive styles with a media query that adjusts the layout (e.g., wider padding on desktop), confirming a responsive design approach.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  The component maps over the characters array to display the list items (each with a key based on the character's URL), ensuring that search results are displayed once the API response is received.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  The separate ErrorBoundary component is implemented using React's error boundary techniques (getDerivedStateFromError and componentDidCatch). It wraps the main component, handling runtime errors gracefully.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The code defines TypeScript interfaces for Character and SwapiResponse, as well as for props in the ErrorBoundary component, ensuring strict typing throughout the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The solution integrates debouncing, API data fetching, and search functionality without changing the public API of the component. The initial behaviour is preserved (i.e., triggering an API call with an empty search query), and no breaking changes are introduced.
