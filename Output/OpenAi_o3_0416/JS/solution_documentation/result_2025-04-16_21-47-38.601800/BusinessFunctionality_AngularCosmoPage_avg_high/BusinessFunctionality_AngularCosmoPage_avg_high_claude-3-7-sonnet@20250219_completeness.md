  The documentation outlines the API endpoints in Section 6 (DATA MANAGEMENT STRATEGY) showing the CRUD operations for content (POST api/content, GET api/content/:id, PUT api/content/:id, DELETE api/content/:id) and also mentions endpoints for revisions and extras.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains the Page factory and its role in storing global page variables
  
  Section 1 describes the Page factory as a "singleton that holds the 'working copy' of the page being edited (title, body, extras, etc.)." The data flow section further clarifies its role.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the Users factory and its purpose for user data management
  
  The documentation describes the Users factory as a "singleton that describes the currently authenticated user (id, role, …)" in Section 1, and elaborates on its uses in Section 7.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page controller's responsibilities and features
  
  The documentation explains in Section 1 that pageCtrl "orchestrates all page-editing operations (form binding, autosave to localStorage, CRUD via REST, revision handling, tag autocomplete, notifications)."

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the local storage mechanism for unsaved changes
  
  The documentation explains the localStorage mechanism in multiple sections, stating it's "used for 'draft' caching" and details how "Periodic 'saveLocal()' writes specific fields to localStorage keyed by url+field."

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains the version comparison functionality
  
  Section 2.A describes the top notification bar with ng-show="newerVersion" that "Alerts user if a newer local draft exists" and provides options to "Discard, Compare (localVersion), Use (localVersion)."

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the page creation workflow
  
  Section 2 under "Primary user journeys" clearly describes the create new page workflow: "Create new page (route /new) – Fill form → Save → POST /api/content + related endpoints."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page editing workflow
  
  Section 2 under "Primary user journeys" describes the update workflow: "Update existing page (/page-url) – Modify fields → Save → PUT /api/content/{id} + new revision + extras."

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the page duplication feature
  
  Section 2 describes the duplication workflow: "Duplicate page – Click Duplicate → validation enforces a different URL → POST new record." Additional details are provided in the business rules section.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains the page deletion process
  
  Section 2 describes the deletion process: "Delete page – Confirm → cascaded DELETE to content, revisions, extras, tags → redirect to /new." Business rules also mention cascade deletes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the auto-URL generation from title feature
  
  This is explained in Section 3 under business rules: "URL slug is derived from title by default (lowercase, spaces→dash, punctuation stripped)."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains tag management and autocompletion
  
  The documentation mentions "Tags – comma-separated list with live autocomplete (server query)" in Section 2.C and further explains "Tag autocomplete suggests server-side existing tags" in the business rules.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the publication status options (publish, draft, schedule)
  
  Section 2.C clearly states "Publish status – radio buttons: Publish (Y), Draft (N), Schedule."

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains scheduled content publishing
  
  The documentation mentions "Schedule – datetime-local input shown only if status == 'schedule'" in Section 2.C and includes related business rules about scheduled publishing in Section 3.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes page revision management
  
  The documentation explains in Section 3 that "Each save of an existing page creates a historical revision" and further details the revision model in Section 6.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the handling of page extras and additional data
  
  The documentation defines ContentExtras as "arbitrary key/value blobs tied to a page (featured image, etc.)" in Section 3 and explains their handling in relation to revisions in Section 6.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes form validation mechanisms
  
  Section 2 under "Form validation / guards" describes validation requirements: "Must select a type. URL cannot be empty, 'new', or duplicate (when duplicating). Scheduled date in the past automatically flips publish flag to 'Y'."

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains error handling during API operations
  
  The documentation mentions that "Server replies propagate success/failure via promise callbacks → $translate → $rootScope.$broadcast('notify')" in Section 1's data flow description.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes notification messaging for user feedback
  
  The documentation explains the notification mechanism in the data flow section, with server replies propagating to notifications via $rootScope.$broadcast('notify').

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the theme-specific page types feature
  
  Section 2.C mentions "Type selector – <select> is sourced from page.themePages (theme dependent)" and Section 5 references "themePages array must be pre-loaded elsewhere."

  The documentation mentions "ContentExtras" which include "featured image, etc." in Section 3, though specific details about image handling are limited.

- **Pass** (95%): Validate the documentation explains URL validation and error handling
  
  The documentation states URL validation requirements in multiple places, mentioning it "cannot be empty, 'new', or duplicate (when duplicating)" and that "URL uniqueness and validation handled client-side; server must still enforce." However, it doesn't provide comprehensive details on all potential URL validation error scenarios, hence the 95% confidence.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the tag suggestion system based on user input
  
  The documentation explains the tag system in Section 2.C as "Tags – comma-separated list with live autocomplete (server query)" and in Section 5 notes that "Tag autocomplete fires a GET for every keystroke (no debounce)."
