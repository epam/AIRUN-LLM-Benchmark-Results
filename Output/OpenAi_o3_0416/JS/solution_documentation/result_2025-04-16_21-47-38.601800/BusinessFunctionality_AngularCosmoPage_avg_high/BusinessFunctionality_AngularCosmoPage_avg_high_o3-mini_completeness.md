# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation identifies all major components (REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, pageCtrl)  
  The documentation clearly lists and describes the REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and pageCtrl.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the purpose of the REST factory for API communication  
  The purpose is explained as a thin wrapper around $resource for interacting with various API endpoints.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm the documentation describes all API endpoints exposed in the REST factory  
  While the documentation does mention that the REST factory returns a $resource for several API entities (e.g., blocks, content, tags, extras), it does not provide a detailed description of every individual API endpoint exposed. This omission makes this evaluation step incomplete.  
  Reason for less than 100% confidence: There is partial coverage by listing some endpoints, but the comprehensive list or detailed description for each endpoint is missing.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains the Page factory and its role in storing global page variables  
  The documentation describes the Page factory as a singleton that holds the “working copy” of the page being edited.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the Users factory and its purpose for user data management  
  The Users factory is clearly explained as holding data for the currently authenticated user (e.g., id, role).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page controller's responsibilities and features  
  The page controller (pageCtrl) is well-documented, including its roles like form binding, autosave, CRUD operations, revision handling, and tag autocomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the local storage mechanism for unsaved changes  
  The text explains that localStorage is used for “draft” caching and details how unsaved changes are handled.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains the version comparison functionality  
  It is mentioned that on controller initialization, differences between localStorage and server state trigger a “newer version” warning.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the page creation workflow  
  The “Primary user journeys” section clearly explains the process of creating a new page.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page editing workflow  
  The update mechanism for an existing page is detailed under the page editing workflow.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the page duplication feature  
  The duplication process is directly mentioned, including the need for validation of a different URL.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains the page deletion process  
  The deletion workflow is clearly described, including confirmation states and cascaded DELETE operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the auto-URL generation from title feature  
  It is explained that the URL is auto-filled from the Title until the user changes it and details the process of URL slug generation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains tag management and autocompletion  
  The documentation covers tag management, describing the comma-separated input and live autocomplete with server queries.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the publication status options (publish, draft, schedule)  
  Publication status is detailed with radio buttons and possible values (e.g., Publish, Draft, Schedule).

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains scheduled content publishing  
  The scheduled publishing is explained, including the use of a datetime‑local input and how a scheduled date earlier than the current time converts the page to immediate publish.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes page revision management  
  The revision model is well-documented, noting that each save of an existing page creates a historical revision.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the handling of page extras and additional data  
  The handling of ContentExtras is mentioned as key/value blobs attached to a page with details on how they are saved.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes form validation mechanisms  
  The documentation lists several guards such as requiring a selected type, non-empty URL, and duplicate URL prevention.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate the documentation explains error handling during API operations  
  The documentation briefly mentions that server replies propagate success/failure via promise callbacks, which indirectly addresses error handling.  
  Reason for less than 100% confidence: Although error handling is mentioned, the explanation is minimal without a deep dive into potential error scenarios.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes notification messaging for user feedback  
  Notification messaging is covered through the reference to $rootScope.$broadcast('notify') and the actions on the top notification bar.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the theme-specific page types feature  
  The documentation states that the type selector sources options from page.themePages, indicating a theme dependency.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the featured image handling  
  Featured image handling is implicitly described as part of the ContentExtras (e.g., “featured image, etc.”).

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains URL validation and error handling  
  URL validation is covered by noting that the URL cannot be empty, “new”, or duplicate, ensuring proper validation rules are in place.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the tag suggestion system based on user input  
  The tag suggestion system is described as live autocomplete based on server queries in the Tags section.
