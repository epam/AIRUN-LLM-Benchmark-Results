# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verified that the documentation correctly identifies the application as a React signup form for the PodBaby platform.  
  The documentation clearly outlines the signup page, its features, and the use of React components, confirming the application’s nature.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirmed that the documentation accurately describes the validation rules for name (3-60 characters), email (valid format), and password (minimum 6 characters).  
  The provided text explicitly lists these restrictions in the "Data-validation rules & error handling" section.

- **Pass** (100%): Validated that the documentation correctly explains the asynchronous validation for checking existing usernames and emails.  
  It details that leaving the Name or E‑mail field triggers remote uniqueness checks via api.isName and api.isEmail, as well as the use of asyncValidate in redux‑form.

- **Pass** (100%): Verified that the documentation accurately describes the form submission process and API interaction.  
  The explanation covers the sequence: front‑end validation, POST /signup API call, handling success with signupComplete dispatch, and error propagation via rejected Promise.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirmed that the documentation correctly explains the Redux integration for state management.  
  It elaborates on how form state is managed via redux‑form and how authenticated user state is updated in the auth reducer upon successful signup.

- **Pass** (100%): Validated that the documentation accurately describes the form feedback mechanisms for validation errors.  
  The documentation specifies the use of visual cues (green and red outlines) and inline help-text based on the field’s validation state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verified that the documentation accurately describes the FormGroup component's role in displaying validation feedback.  
  It states that the FormGroup is a presentational component that wraps the react‑bootstrap Input to apply styles and display error messages.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirmed that the documentation correctly explains the Promise-based architecture for parallel validation checks.  
  The documentation details that checkName and checkEmail run concurrently via Promise.all to minimize latency.

- **Pass** (100%): Validated that the documentation accurately describes the user flow from form completion to successful signup.  
  It outlines the entire journey from landing on /signup to entering data, receiving visual feedback, and after the submission process.

- **Pass** (100%): Verified that the documentation accurately explains the error handling during form submission.  
  The error propagation methods via redux‑form, synchronous and asynchronous validations, and how errors are displayed are well described.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirmed that the documentation correctly identifies the document title management using react-document-title.  
  The text specifies that the page title is set dynamically (“Signup | PodBaby”) and mentions a utility for <DocumentTitle>.

- **Pass** (100%): Validated that the documentation accurately describes the integration with React Router for navigation.  
  There is mention of a secondary navigation link to /login (via react-router) and reference to routing for redirection post-signup.
