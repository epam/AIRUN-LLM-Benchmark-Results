# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers all main functionality including adding, editing, deleting, and toggling todos
  
  The document thoroughly covers these core functions in section 1.1 Core Features:
  - "Add a new todo (ENTER in "What needs to be done?" input)"
  - "Toggle a single todo's completion status (checkbox)"
  - "Edit a todo title (double-click label → inline text field...)"
  - "Delete a todo (✕ button)"

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about filtering todos by status (all, active, completed)
  
  This is clearly covered in section 1.1: "Filter list: "All", "Active", "Completed" (URL hash routes #/, #/active, #/completed)"

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the user workflow for creating new todo items
  
  The document describes this in section 4 (User Workflow):
  "Type a task, press ENTER → item appears unchecked, counter increments."

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the editing functionality triggered by double-clicking
  
  This is explicitly mentioned in multiple places:
  - Section 1.1: "Edit a todo title (double-click label → inline text field, ENTER to save, ESC to cancel, blur to save)"
  - Section 4: "Double-click label → edit → ENTER"

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the clear completed functionality
  
  The document mentions this in section 1.1: "Clear all completed todos ("Clear completed" button)" and in section 4: "Clear completed" & "Mark all as complete" provide batch management."

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the toggle all functionality
  
  This is covered in section 1.1: "Toggle ALL todos at once (top "toggle-all" checkbox)" and referenced in section 4 as part of batch management features.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the counter for remaining items
  
  The document mentions this in section 1.1: "Display counts: "X items left"" and in section 4: "Feedback counters ("X items left") update in real time."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the persistent storage of todos
  
  This is covered thoroughly:
  - Section 1.1: "Persist todos between sessions (localStorage key "react-todos")"
  - Section 3 (data flow): "Model mutates its internal array immutably and executes inform(). inform() persists to localStorage..."
  - Section 5 mentions persistence as a business objective
  - Section 6 discusses localStorage constraints

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the UI components and their relationships
  
  The document has an entire section (2. Component Architecture & Relationships) that details the component tree, component responsibilities, and data relationships between components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the business objectives addressed by the application
  
  Section 5 is dedicated to Business Objectives, outlining primary goals, secondary goals, and how the application aligns with business needs.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes performance and scalability considerations
  
  Section 7 is specifically dedicated to "Performance & Scalability Review," covering optimizations, potential bottlenecks, and scalability paths.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes technical constraints and limitations
  
  Section 6 "Constraints & Assumptions" thoroughly covers technical constraints, architectural assumptions, and external dependencies.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure the document covers the pluralization of item/items text based on count
  
  While the document mentions "Display counts: 'X items left'" and "Feedback counters ('X items left') update in real time," it doesn't explicitly mention pluralization logic for handling singular vs. plural text (i.e., "1 item left" vs. "X items left"). This specific detail about pluralization based on count is not clearly addressed.
