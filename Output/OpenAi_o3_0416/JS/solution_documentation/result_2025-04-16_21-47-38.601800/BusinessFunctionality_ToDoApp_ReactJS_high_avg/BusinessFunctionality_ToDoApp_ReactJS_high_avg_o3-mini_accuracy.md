# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document identifies the application as a Todo list management application  
  The document clearly states that the codebase implements a single‑page “Todo list” application in React/TypeScript.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the component structure (TodoApp, TodoItem, TodoFooter)  
  The document details a top‑level tree with components such as TodoApp, TodoItem, and TodoFooter, along with their responsibilities.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of local storage for data persistence  
  It explicitly mentions that data is stored using the browser’s localStorage (key “react‑todos”) and how it is persisted between sessions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the state management approach using the TodoModel  
  The document provides an in-depth explanation of TodoModel’s role as the single source of truth for the todos array, including its CRUD operations and publish/subscribe mechanism.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the routing mechanism for filtering todos  
  It accurately describes the filter functionality through URL hash routes (#/, #/active, #/completed) and mentions the integration with a Router.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the event handling for user interactions  
  The evaluation outlines the complete user interaction workflow including handlers like onChange, onKeyDown, and the associated lifecycle events.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of immutable data structures for state management  
  It explains that the model mutates its state immutably using techniques like Utils.extend, concat, and map.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the performance optimization using shouldComponentUpdate  
  The discussion on TodoItem.shouldComponentUpdate and the rationale behind the shallow prop/state comparisons is clear and accurate.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of the Utils class for helper functions  
  The document mentions the use of Utils.uuid for unique id generation and details its supporting role within the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the data flow between components  
  The explanation of the unidirectional data flow from user event to component handler, to model mutation and subsequent re-render is comprehensive and accurate.
