# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented

    The code properly implements page creation, updating, deletion, and duplication through the savePage and deletePage thunks in pageSlice.ts, with corresponding UI handlers in PageEditor.tsx.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present

    Page type selection is implemented with a select dropdown in the PageEditor.tsx component, with available page types stored in the themePages array and selection handled by the onChange event.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists

    URL auto-generation from title is implemented in the PageEditor component with the autoUrl state and effect that transforms the title into a URL-friendly string.

- **Fail** (90%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented

    While the code mentions "TagSuggestions is a reusable presentational component" and includes tags in the PageState interface, the full implementation of tag management with autocomplete is not provided in the code snippets. There's a comment indicating where this would go, but the actual implementation is missing.

- **Fail** (70%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available

    The PageState interface includes a publish field of type PublishState ('Y' | 'N' | 'schedule'), but the actual UI implementation for selecting publish status options is missing from the provided code. There's a comment "PUBLISH RADIO" but the implementation is not shown.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented

    Scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented in the PageState type with a scheduleDate field, and the savePage function handles logic to update the publish state based on the schedule date.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present

    Local storage comparison and restoration is implemented through the useLocalStorage hook and the newerVersion detection in PageEditor, with UI buttons to discard, compare, or use the stored version.

- **Fail** (80%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented

    While the pageSlice handles errors in the state, there's no explicit notification system shown for displaying success/error messages to the user. The error field exists in the PageState but there's no UI component shown that would display these messages.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present

    Form validation for required fields is implemented in the onSave method, which checks if the page type is selected and if the URL is valid before proceeding with the save operation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled

    The pageApi.ts file includes all necessary API endpoints for page management: fetch, create, update, delete, saveRevision, saveExtra, deleteTags, and saveTag.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented

    Extras management is implemented with the ExtraPayload interface and the saveExtra API endpoint in pageApi.ts. The extras field is included in the PageState interface.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained

    Revision history functionality is supported through the PageRevision interface and the saveRevision API endpoint in pageApi.ts.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components

    The code follows a clean feature-based organization with separate folders for features (page, users), components, hooks, services, and routes. Business logic is separated from UI components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved

    Translation functionality is implemented using react-i18next with proper setup in i18n/index.ts and usage in the PageEditor component through the useTranslation hook.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters

    The application maintains the URL structure with routes defined in AppRouter.tsx, including /new and /:url paths for the PageEditor component.
