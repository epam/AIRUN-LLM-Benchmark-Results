# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props  
  All files use the .tsx extension where appropriate, and components as well as utility functions (e.g. useLocalStorage) are typed. While some typings (such as for props in Button.tsx) rely on extending built‐in interfaces, overall strict typing is properly applied.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management  
  The code utilizes Redux Toolkit's configureStore and createSlice (in pageSlice.ts and userSlice.ts) to manage global state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components  
  Every component (e.g. PageEditor, Button, AppRouter) is implemented as a functional component.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately  
  The implementation makes proper use of useState, useEffect, and useCallback. Although useMemo isn’t explicitly used, the current code shows hook usage that fits the design needs.  
  (Slight uncertainty arises since useMemo is recommended for expensive computations, but no obvious misuse is present.)

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource  
  Axios is used throughout the API files (api.ts and pageApi.ts) to handle HTTP requests.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components  
  The PageEditor component maintains its own form state via useState and synchronizes it with inputs, constituting a controlled-component approach.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation  
  The AppRouter component leverages react-router-dom (with BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route) for routing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization  
  The setup uses react-i18next alongside i18next-http-backend, which is a standard choice for i18n in React projects.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization  
  Code splitting is demonstrated by the dynamic import of the PageEditor component using React.lazy within the AppRouter.

- **Fail** (95%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations  
  Although the performance optimization notes recommend wrapping pure presentational components (like Button, Input, TagSuggestions) with React.memo, the provided Button component (and others) are not explicitly wrapped with React.memo.  
  (The slight uncertainty is due to the blueprint mentioning memoization in notes, but it is not shown in the implementation.)

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks  
  Most useEffect hooks correctly specify their dependency arrays; however, the useEffect for detecting a newer local version is declared with an empty dependency array despite referencing ls.value and page.updatedAt, potentially leading to stale comparisons.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models  
  The code defines interfaces and types (e.g. PageState, PagePayload, PageResponse, PageRevision, ExtraPayload) to model the data consistently across the project.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state  
  The selector selectPage is created and used to access state within the PageEditor component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations  
  Action creators such as setField, resetPage, and setThemePages are defined within the slice to handle state mutations appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks  
  The custom hook useLocalStorage is implemented using useCallback and integrates well with the component logic in PageEditor.
