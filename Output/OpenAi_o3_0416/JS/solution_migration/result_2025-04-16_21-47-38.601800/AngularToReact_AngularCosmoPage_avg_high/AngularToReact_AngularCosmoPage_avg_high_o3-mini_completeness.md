# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
  All required operations are provided via Redux async thunks (savePage handles create/update with duplicate support, deletePage handles deletion).  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
  The PageEditor component renders a select element for page type and uses available themePages, ensuring that users can choose a page type.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
  A useEffect in PageEditor updates the URL field based on the title, converting it to lowercase and replacing spaces/punctuation appropriately.  

- **Fail** (90%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
  Although a “TagSuggestions” component is mentioned and its file exists in the folder structure, the PageEditor’s tag section only contains a placeholder comment. The actual integration and demonstration of autocomplete functionality are missing.  
  (I am 90% confident in this assessment because the intent is clear, but the implementation details are absent from the provided code snippet.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
  The PageState type defines publish values as 'Y', 'N', or 'schedule', and the onSave logic applies the correct publishing status conditions.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
  A scheduleDate field is maintained and the onSave function checks whether the scheduled date has passed when publish is set to 'schedule'.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
  The useLocalStorage hook is used in PageEditor to store drafts, and newerVersion state is determined by comparing timestamps between local storage and the store’s version.  

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
  The code uses alerts (e.g., alert(t('page_no_type_selected')) and alert(t('page_no_url'))) for validation errors, but there is no dedicated notification or toast system for success/error messages.  

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
  The onSave handler checks for the existence of a page type and a valid URL before proceeding, invoking alerts if validations fail.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
  The pageApi module includes methods for fetch, create, update, delete, saveRevision, saveExtra, deleteTags, and saveTag, matching expected REST endpoints.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
  A saveExtra API method is provided and the PageState/type definitions include an extras field to handle additional data.  

- **Fail** (80%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
  Although a saveRevision endpoint and a PageRevision type are defined, there is no visible UI or further handling for revision history in the PageEditor component. This makes the revision functionality only partially maintained.  
  (I am 80% confident in this assessment because the backend API is set up but the front‑end integration is absent.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
  The folder structure clearly separates features (business logic and state management) from components (UI elements).  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
  The i18next configuration, useTranslation hook usage in PageEditor, and the import of the i18n initialization in main.tsx ensure that internationalisation is fully implemented.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
  The BrowserRouter configuration in AppRouter provides routes for /new and /:url to route to PageEditor, maintaining consistent URL parameters.
