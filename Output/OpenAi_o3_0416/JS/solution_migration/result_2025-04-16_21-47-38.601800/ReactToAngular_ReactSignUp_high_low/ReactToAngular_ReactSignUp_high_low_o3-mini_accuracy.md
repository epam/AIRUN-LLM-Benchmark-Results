# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The SignupComponent uses FormBuilder to create a reactive form group and ReactiveFormsModule is imported.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The form group defines Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3), Validators.maxLength(60) for name; Validators.required and Validators.email for email; and Validators.required with Validators.minLength(6) for password.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  Both the name and email form controls use async validators (uniqueNameValidator and uniqueEmailValidator) that perform API calls through AuthService to check if they are already taken.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The FormGroupComponent template applies conditional CSS classes ("has-error" for touched & invalid, "has-success" for touched & valid) and displays error messages accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  The onSubmit() method dispatches the signup action with the form values. The corresponding effect uses AuthService.signup to process the API call and dispatches success or failure actions accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The template includes a span that displays error messages piped through ErrorMessagePipe when a control is touched and has errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  In ngOnInit(), the Title service is used to set the title to 'Signup | PodBaby'.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The component dispatches actions using Store, and the module integrates authReducer with StoreModule.forFeature and AuthEffects with EffectsModule.forFeature.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button uses [disabled]="form.pending || form.invalid", ensuring it is disabled when the form is pending or invalid.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  In the effect, the API call is managed with switchMap and catchError to dispatch either signupSuccess or signupFailure actions based on the API response.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component is well-structured, with modular organization and separation of concerns (form handling, validations, state management). However, the use of "as any" when passing form controls to the FormGroupComponent could be scoped more rigorously for type-safety. This is a minor point of improvement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  AuthService makes appropriate use of HttpClient to perform API calls using observables.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The ErrorMessagePipe returns clear and specific error messages (e.g., for required fields, minlength, maxlength, proper email format, and duplicate name/email checks) that meet the outlined requirements.
