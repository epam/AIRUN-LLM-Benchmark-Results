# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The code explicitly mentions "a clean, compile-ready Angular 14 implementation" in its introduction, and the code structure and syntax are consistent with Angular 14.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
  
  The implementation includes proper NgRx store integration with imports from '@ngrx/store', a properly defined store structure, and state management pattern.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
  
  The code includes '@ngrx/effects' with a properly implemented TodoEffects class that handles localStorage side effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
  
  The implementation includes well-structured actions, reducers, and selectors in separate files following NgRx best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
  
  All components use the @Component decorator, with @Input and @Output decorators for property binding and event emitting.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators
  
  React refs have been properly replaced with Angular's @ViewChild, as seen in the TodoHeaderComponent and TodoItemComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
  
  The code demonstrates consistent use of @Input() for property binding and @Output() with EventEmitter for event handling across components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
  
  Angular services are implemented, particularly the TodoLocalStorageService which handles localStorage operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
  
  Dependency injection is correctly implemented, with services properly injected into components and effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
  
  ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush is applied to components as appropriate for performance optimization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
  
  Angular Router is properly implemented in the AppRoutingModule with routes for '/', '/active', and '/completed'.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code follows Angular style guide conventions with proper naming, file organization, and component structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
  
  TypeScript interfaces and types are properly defined and used consistently throughout the codebase.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
  
  All JSX templates have been properly converted to Angular HTML template syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
  
  React event handlers have been replaced with Angular event bindings like (click), (change), (input), etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs
  
  There are no TODO comments in the code.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules
  
  The code mentions that the feature module is "self-contained and can be lazy-loaded if required," which suggests the structure supports lazy loading. However, I don't see explicit lazy loading implementation in the routes. The structure supports it, but it's not explicitly implemented.
