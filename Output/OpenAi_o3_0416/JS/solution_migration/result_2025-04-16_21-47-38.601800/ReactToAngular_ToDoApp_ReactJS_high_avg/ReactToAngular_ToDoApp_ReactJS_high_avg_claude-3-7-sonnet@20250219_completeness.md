# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items

    The implementation includes a TodoListComponent that receives todos as input and renders them using an ngFor directive. The todos are obtained from the store using the selectVisibleTodos selector.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented

    The TodoHeaderComponent has proper implementation for adding new todos. It listens for the ENTER key, emits the add event which is handled by the TodoShellComponent to dispatch the addTodo action to the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works

    Todo item toggling is implemented in the TodoItemComponent with a checkbox input that emits toggle events. The TodoShellComponent handles these events and dispatches toggleTodo actions to update the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented

    The TodoItemComponent has a complete implementation for editing todos, with double-click to edit, Enter to commit, Escape to cancel, and blur handling. It properly emits save events that are handled by the container component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented

    Deletion is implemented with a destroy button in the TodoItemComponent that emits events captured by the container to dispatch destroyTodo actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented

    The application includes a toggle-all checkbox in the shell component that correctly implements the "Mark all as complete" functionality by dispatching toggleAll actions with the appropriate completed state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works

    Filtering is implemented using both Angular Router and NgRx. The routes ('/', '/active', '/completed') correspond to the filters, and the selectVisibleTodos selector in the store handles filtering the todos based on the current filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items

    The TodoFooterComponent receives the activeCount input and displays it correctly with proper pluralization using the Utils.pluralize helper function.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items

    The footer component includes a "Clear completed" button that emits clearCompleted events, which are handled by the shell component to dispatch clearCompleted actions to the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage

    The TodoLocalStorageService handles the loading and saving of todos to localStorage. The NgRx effects system is used to handle side effects, loading todos on initialization and persisting them when changes occur.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation

    The AppRoutingModule defines routes that match the expected URL structure (/, /active, /completed) and associates them with the correct filter values.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states

    The shell component template includes an *ngIf directive to conditionally render the main section only when there are todos. The footer is also conditionally displayed only when there are active or completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly

    The header component properly prevents default form submission behavior and clears the input field after adding a todo. The item component also correctly handles edit submissions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships

    The application follows appropriate component relationships with a container/presentational pattern. The TodoShellComponent acts as a smart container that connects to the store, while child components are presentational and communicate via inputs and outputs.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved

    All the core functionality from the original application is preserved, including UUID generation, todo CRUD operations, filtering, toggling all, and clearing completed items. The implementation is feature-complete compared to the described requirements.
