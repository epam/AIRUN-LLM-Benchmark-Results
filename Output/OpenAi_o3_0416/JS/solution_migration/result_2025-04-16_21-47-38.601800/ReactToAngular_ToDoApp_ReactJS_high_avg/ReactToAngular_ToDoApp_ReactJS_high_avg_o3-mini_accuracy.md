# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The provided code explicitly mentions "Angular 14" and follows Angular 14 conventions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The application uses StoreModule.forRoot with defined reducers, which confirms the usage of @ngrx/store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  The code shows a TodoEffects class with createEffect and proper side-effect handling using @ngrx/effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  The provided actions, reducer logic, and selectors are correctly implemented and cohesively integrated.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  All components use @Component along with @Input and @Output where needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  The code replaces React ref usage with Angular’s @ViewChild (e.g., in the header and item components).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  The component interfaces show proper usage of @Input() for receiving data and @Output() EventEmitter for emitting events.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  The TodoLocalStorageService demonstrates proper usage as an Angular service handling data persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  Dependency injection is used correctly in components (e.g., injecting Store, ActivatedRoute, Router) and services.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  All components that require optimization use ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  The AppRoutingModule makes use of the Angular Router, defining routes with components and routerLink directives.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The structure, naming, and coding style follow the Angular style guide conventions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  Interfaces like Todo and types such as TodoFilter are maintained and used consistently across the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  The code contains Angular HTML templates and does not include any JSX syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  Event handlers in the code use Angular’s (event) binding syntax, such as (keydown) instead of React’s onKeyDown.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  No TODO comments are present in the code as provided.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  While the feature module is self‑contained and can potentially be lazy‑loaded, the current routing configuration (in AppRoutingModule) eagerly imports the TodoModule. There is no use of lazy loading (e.g., via loadChildren) in the provided code.
