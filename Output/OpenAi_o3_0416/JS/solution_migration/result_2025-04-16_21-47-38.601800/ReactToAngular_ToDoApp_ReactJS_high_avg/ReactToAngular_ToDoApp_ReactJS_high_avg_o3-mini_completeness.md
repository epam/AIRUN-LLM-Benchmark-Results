# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The application’s shell component renders the todo list via an *ngFor loop in the todo-list component. The design follows standard Angular practices for displaying lists.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The header component listens for the ENTER key event, and its add() method dispatches the addTodo action. This action is handled by the reducer to append a new todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  The todo item component has a checkbox input that emits a toggle event. The reducer’s toggleTodo handler correctly reverses the todo’s completed state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  The todo-item component supports entering an editing mode, updating the text, and then committing the change via the save event. This mirrors typical inline editing functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  A destroy button is present on each todo item, which triggers the destroyTodo action. The reducer and component logic work together to remove the item correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  The shell component includes a “toggle-all” checkbox. When used, it dispatches the toggleAll action, updating all todos’ completed states reliably.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  The application uses Angular Router data and NgRx selectors to dispatch and apply filters. The selectors in the store correctly return filtered lists based on the current filter state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The footer component receives activeCount via an observable and calls a pluralize function to display the count, which confirms this functionality is appropriately implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The footer’s “Clear completed” button dispatches the clearCompleted action. The reducer then filters out completed todos, ensuring the feature works as intended.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  TodoLocalStorageService is used both for loading and persisting todos via NgRx effects; side‑effects are managed appropriately and align with Angular best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The AppRoutingModule defines routes for '' (root), '/active', and '/completed', along with redirects. The URL structure thus matches the required navigation.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  When there are no todos, only the header is visible (and the main section with the todo list and footer is hidden using *ngIf). While an explicit empty-state message is not displayed, this behavior is typical for many TodoMVC implementations.  
  Explanation: There is no special “empty state” message; however, showing just the header in an empty state is a common pattern in Todo apps. Hence, it is considered acceptable.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  The header component correctly processes key events (specifically ENTER) to add new todos, preventing default behavior and clearing the input upon submission.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The overall component hierarchy is well structured. The shell contains header, list, item, and footer components with clear input/output bindings that facilitate proper communication.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  The complete migration preserves functionality such as adding, editing, toggling, deleting, filtering, and persisting todos. The NgRx store and effects ensure that the core business logic remains intact.
