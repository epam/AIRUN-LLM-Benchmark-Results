# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The code explicitly states it's a migration to Angular 14.x + NgRx 14.x. The implementation uses standard Angular 14 patterns including the modern bootstrap method in main.ts and Angular 14 compatible dependency injection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS
  
  The code uses ES modules with proper import/export statements throughout. The main.ts file also explicitly states "no RequireJS, just standard Angular bootstrap" and uses the platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule pattern.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management
  
  The application correctly implements NgRx Store with proper imports from '@ngrx/store' and includes StoreModule.forRoot({}) in the app module and StoreModule.forFeature in the feature module.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects
  
  NgRx Effects is properly implemented with EffectsModule.forRoot([]) at the app level and EffectsModule.forFeature([TodoEffects]) in the feature module. The TodoEffects class contains properly implemented effects for loading and persisting todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management
  
  The codebase includes properly structured:
  - Actions (todo.actions.ts) with createAction and props
  - Reducer (todo.reducer.ts) with createReducer and on
  - Selectors (todo.selectors.ts) with createFeatureSelector and createSelector
  - Effects (todo.effects.ts) with proper side effect handling

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator
  
  The TodoStorageService is properly decorated with @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }), which is the recommended way to provide services in Angular.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service
  
  The TodoStorageService correctly uses localStorage.getItem and localStorage.setItem to load and persist todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators
  
  All components (HeaderComponent, TodoListComponent, FooterComponent, TodoPageComponent) have the proper @Component decorator with required metadata like selector, template/templateUrl.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators
  
  Both custom directives (TodoFocusDirective, TodoEscapeDirective) are properly decorated with @Directive and include the required selector metadata.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)
  
  The templates correctly use Angular template syntax including *ngFor (in todo-list.component.html), *ngIf (in todo-page.component.html and footer.component.ts).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))
  
  Event binding is correctly implemented using the (event) syntax, for example (click), (change), (blur), (keyup.enter), (todoEscape), etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])
  
  Property binding is correctly implemented using the [property] syntax, for example [class.completed], [checked], [class.editing], etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed
  
  The TodoFocusDirective correctly implements the OnChanges interface and its ngOnChanges lifecycle hook.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models
  
  The Todo model is correctly defined as a TypeScript interface with appropriate properties. The TodoState interface is also properly defined in the reducer.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services
  
  Dependency injection is correctly implemented throughout the application, with services injected into effects class and store injected into components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code follows Angular style guide conventions including:
  - Feature-first organization
  - Proper naming conventions
  - Separation of smart/container and presentational components
  - Flat module structure
  - OnPush change detection for presentational components

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings
  
  The code looks clean and well-structured. While there's no explicit evidence of errors, we can't fully verify runtime behavior without executing the code. However, the structure and patterns used suggest a clean implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)
  
  The code makes appropriate use of TypeScript features including interfaces, type annotations, generics, and proper typing of inputs/outputs.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code
  
  The code is clean with no TODOs or commented-out code. This is explicitly mentioned in the migration notes: "Zero TODOs, no deprecated APIs".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design
  
  The application correctly separates responsibilities:
  - Smart/container components handle state management (TodoPageComponent)
  - Presentational components handle UI rendering (HeaderComponent, TodoListComponent, FooterComponent)
  - Services handle data persistence (TodoStorageService)
  - NgRx patterns separate state management concerns
