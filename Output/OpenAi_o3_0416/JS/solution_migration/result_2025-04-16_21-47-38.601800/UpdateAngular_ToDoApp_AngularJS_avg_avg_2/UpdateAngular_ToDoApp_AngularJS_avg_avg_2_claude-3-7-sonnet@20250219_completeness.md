# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list
  
  The application has `TodoListComponent` in `todos/components/todo-list/todo-list.component.ts` with corresponding HTML template that handles the display of todos using an unordered list.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos
  
  The application has `HeaderComponent` in `todos/components/header/header.component.ts` which contains input for adding new todos and emits an event when a new todo is submitted.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos
  
  Editing functionality is implemented in the `TodoListComponent` which has methods like `startEdit()`, `doneEdit()`, and `cancelEdit()` to handle todo editing.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos
  
  While the container component `TodoPageComponent` has a `filter` property defined as `'all' | 'active' | 'completed'`, the implementation for filtering is not complete. The application doesn't include UI elements in the footer component to switch between filters, nor does it implement the actual filtering logic in the templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics
  
  The `FooterComponent` in `todos/components/footer/footer.component.ts` displays the count of remaining items and completed items.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos
  
  The `HeaderComponent` emits an `add` event which the container component handles by dispatching `TodoActions.addTodo()`. The reducer generates a unique ID and adds the new todo to the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos
  
  The `TodoListComponent` allows editing via double-click and emits an `update` event. The container component dispatches `TodoActions.updateTodoTitle()` to persist the change.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos
  
  The `TodoListComponent` includes a destroy button that emits a `remove` event, which the container component handles by dispatching `TodoActions.removeTodo()`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed
  
  The `TodoListComponent` includes a toggle checkbox that emits a `toggle` event, which the container component handles by dispatching `TodoActions.toggleTodo()`.

- **Fail** (95%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)
  
  While the `TodoPageComponent` has a `filter` property, the implementation lacks the UI elements in the footer to select different filters and the actual filtering logic is not implemented in the template. The routing for different filter states is also missing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete
  
  The application includes a toggle-all checkbox in the `todo-page.component.html` that calls `toggleAll()` which dispatches `TodoActions.toggleAll()`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos
  
  The `FooterComponent` has a "Clear completed" button that emits a `clearCompleted` event, which the container component handles by dispatching `TodoActions.clearCompleted()`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos
  
  The `FooterComponent` displays the count of remaining items from the `remaining` input property, which is bound to `remainingCount$` observable in the container.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage
  
  The `TodoStorageService` handles localStorage operations, and the `TodoEffects.persist$` effect ensures todos are saved after any state-changing action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization
  
  The `TodoEffects.load$` effect loads todos from localStorage when the application initializes (`ROOT_EFFECTS_INIT`) or when a `loadTodos` action is dispatched.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing
  
  The `TodoEscapeDirective` listens for Escape key press and emits an event which the `TodoListComponent` uses to cancel editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo
  
  The `TodoFocusDirective` is applied to the edit input field and focuses it automatically when the `todoFocus` input property is true.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original
  
  The HTML structure follows the TodoMVC template closely with appropriate class names. However, without seeing the original appearance or CSS references, I cannot be 100% certain.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately
  
  The application checks for empty titles: in `HeaderComponent.submit()` it trims and checks before emitting, and in `TodoListComponent.doneEdit()` it removes the todo if the title is empty after trimming.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter
  
  The application does not implement any routing or URL manipulation based on the filter. There's no evidence of RouterModule being imported or route configurations that would update the URL.
