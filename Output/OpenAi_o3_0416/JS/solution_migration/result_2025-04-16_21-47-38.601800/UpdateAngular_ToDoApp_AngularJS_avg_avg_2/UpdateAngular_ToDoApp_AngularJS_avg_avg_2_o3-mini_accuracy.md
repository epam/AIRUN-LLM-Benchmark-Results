# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The documentation and code comments clearly state the migration to Angular 14.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
  The description and code (e.g., standard Angular bootstrap in main.ts) confirm the use of ES Modules.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
  The code imports and uses StoreModule and defines state management logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
  The application uses EffectsModule with a defined TodoEffects class.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
  The code includes detailed definitions for actions (in todo.actions.ts), reducers (in todo.reducer.ts), selectors (in todo.selectors.ts), and effects (in todo.effects.ts).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
  The TodoStorageService is decorated with @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }) confirming proper injection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
  The TodoStorageService explicitly uses localStorage to get and set todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
  All components (e.g., HeaderComponent, TodoPageComponent) are correctly annotated with @Component and have associated metadata.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
  The custom directives (TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective) are created with the @Directive decorator.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
  The code demonstrates proper use of Angular template syntax like *ngFor and *ngIf in component HTML files.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
  Event binding is correctly implemented in templates (e.g., (click)="remove.emit(todo.id)", (keyup.enter)="submit()").

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
  The templates correctly adopt property binding such as [class.completed] and [checked].

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
  Lifecycle hooks are utilized, for example, the TodoFocusDirective implements ngOnChanges to handle changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
  The Todo model is defined using a TypeScript interface in todo.model.ts.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
  Constructors in components and services correctly inject required dependencies (e.g., Store, TodoStorageService).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The project structure (feature-first folders, explicit imports, no barrels) and code formatting adhere to the Angular Style Guide.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
  Based on the clean code presentation and absence of deprecated APIs in the provided code, it is expected that no console errors or warnings occur. However, without executing the code, there is a slight uncertainty.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
  The code extensively uses TypeScript, including strict typings and interfaces.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
  The provided code and documentation have no visible TODOs or commented-out code fragments.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows the single responsibility principle in component design  
  The separation between presentation components, container components, services, and state management clearly indicates adherence to the single responsibility principle.
