# Evaluation Report

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list  
  The code includes the TodoListComponent (in todos/components/todo-list/todo-list.component.ts) which displays the list of todos.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos  
  The HeaderComponent (in todos/components/header/header.component.ts) provides an input for entering new todo titles and emits an event to add them.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos  
  The TodoListComponent implements editing logic via inline editing, including starting an edit (on double-click) and finishing or canceling editing.

- **Fail (100%)**: Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos  
  While the TodoPageComponent declares a filter property (with values 'all', 'active', 'completed'), there is no dedicated filtering component or UI elements (e.g. filter links) that allow the user to select between these filters. The filtering mechanism is not visibly implemented.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics  
  The FooterComponent displays the count of remaining items and conditionally shows the “Clear completed” button, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos  
  The HeaderComponent captures new todo titles and triggers the add event, which is handled by the TodoPageComponent to dispatch an add action. This ensures new todos are added.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos  
  The TodoListComponent allows editing by switching to an edit mode and then dispatching an update event on completion, thereby implementing the edit functionality.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos  
  There is a delete functionality implemented in the TodoListComponent (via the remove event) which triggers deletion through the TodoPageComponent.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed  
  The application includes a toggle mechanism in both the UI and reducer logic (TodoActions.toggleTodo and corresponding reducer logic) to mark todos as completed/incomplete.

- **Fail (100%)**: Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)  
  Although a filter property exists in the TodoPageComponent, there is no visible UI control or implementation that lets the user filter the list based on the selected category. Accordingly, the filtering functionality is not fully implemented.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete  
  The TodoPageComponent provides a toggleAll function that dispatches the toggleAll action, and the reducer updates all todos accordingly.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos  
  The clearCompleted functionality is implemented in both the actions and reducer as well as exposed via the FooterComponent.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos  
  The TodoPageComponent selects the remaining count (using selectRemainingCount) and passes it to the FooterComponent, which then displays it.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage  
  The TodoStorageService handles storing todos to localStorage and is invoked by an NgRx effect (persist$), ensuring persistence is implemented.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization  
  The TodoEffects load$ effect loads the persisted todos from localStorage during initialization.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing  
  The TodoEscapeDirective listens for the Escape key, and when detected (via the (todoEscape) event), it calls cancelEdit() in the TodoListComponent.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo  
  The TodoFocusDirective is used on the editing input field to automatically focus it when a todo is being edited.

- **Pass (90%)**: Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original  
  The migration documentation claims identical behavior and appearance; however, without a live visual comparison, this is taken on faith. The consistency in structural components (header, list, footer) supports this, though slight visual differences could occur due to Angular 14 conventions.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately  
  Both in the HeaderComponent (which trims and validates non-empty input before emitting) and in the TodoListComponent (where an empty title during edit leads to deletion), the application properly handles empty todo titles.

- **Fail (100%)**: Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter  
  The provided code does not include any logic for updating the URL when a filter is selected (e.g., no routing or URL parameter updates are implemented for filtering), which is a shortcoming compared to the original TodoMVC behavior.
