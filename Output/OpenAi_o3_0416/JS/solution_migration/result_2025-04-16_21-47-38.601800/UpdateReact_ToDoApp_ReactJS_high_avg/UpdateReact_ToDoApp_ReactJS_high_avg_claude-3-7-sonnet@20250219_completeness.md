# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed
  
  The implementation clearly handles this in the Header component with the `handleKeyDown` function that checks for the ENTER_KEY (13), gets the trimmed value from the input ref, dispatches the addTodo action, and clears the input field.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter
  
  The TodoList component properly uses a selector (`selectVisibleTodos`) to filter todos based on the current filter state (all, active, completed) and then maps over the filtered list to render TodoItem components.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos
  
  The toggle-all functionality is implemented in the Todos component with the `onToggleAll` callback that dispatches the toggleAll action with the checkbox's checked state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted
  
  The TodoItem component includes the functionality to toggle a todo's completion status (`onToggle`), edit a todo's title (edit mode + submit), and delete a todo (`onDestroy`).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode
  
  The TodoItem component has an `onEdit` callback attached to the label's onDoubleClick event that sets the editing state to true and initializes the edit text field with the current title.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo
  
  In TodoItem, the `onKeyDown` function checks for ENTER_KEY (13) and calls the submit function, which dispatches the editTodo action with the updated title.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value
  
  The `onKeyDown` handler in TodoItem checks for ESC_KEY (27) and, when detected, sets editing to false and restores the text state to the original todo.title.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The TodoFooter component receives the activeCount prop and displays it along with the appropriate pluralization of "item" or "items".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The TodoFooter component includes a filter UI with links for All, Active, and Completed filters, with the appropriate CSS class to indicate which is currently selected.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos
  
  The TodoFooter includes a conditional "Clear completed" button that shows only when completedCount > 0 and calls the onClearCompleted function when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence
  
  The todoSlice.ts file includes a local storage helper function (`persist`) that is called after every state-modifying action to save the todos to localStorage. It also loads from localStorage in the initialState.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state
  
  The implementation conditionally renders the main section when there are todos, and conditionally renders the footer when there are active or completed todos. The "Clear completed" button is also conditionally rendered.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count
  
  In TodoFooter, there's a specific line to determine the word "item" or "items" based on activeCount: `const itemWord = activeCount === 1 ? 'item' : 'items';`

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components
  
  The application is well-organized into smaller, focused components: Header, TodoList, TodoItem, TodoFooter, and Todos. Each component has a clear responsibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality
  
  The code follows a feature-based organization approach with a clear structure:
  - app/ for core application setup
  - features/todos/ for todo-related components and state
  - Each feature includes its slice file (for state) and component files
