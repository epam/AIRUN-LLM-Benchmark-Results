# Evaluation Report

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that all React imports use React 18.x compatible syntax  
  All files correctly import React 18 features such as createRoot from 'react-dom/client', which confirms compatibility with React 18.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that all components use functional component syntax with hooks instead of class components  
  Every component is implemented as a functional component and utilizes hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect, useCallback) instead of class-based lifecycle methods.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that Redux Toolkit's createSlice is used for state management  
  The state management implementation in todoSlice.ts is done with createSlice from Redux Toolkit.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are defined for all props, state, and Redux store  
  Interfaces such as Todo, TodosState, and prop interfaces are defined, and type definitions for the Redux store (RootState, AppDispatch) are present.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that the application uses immutable state updates in reducers  
  Although the reducers use mutable operations, Redux Toolkit’s built‑in Immer ensures that updates remain immutable.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that nanoid is used for ID generation instead of custom UUID implementation  
  The code explicitly imports and uses nanoid from 'nanoid' for generating unique IDs.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure that the application uses React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate  
  Components such as Header, TodoItem, TodoList, TodoFooter, and Todos are wrapped with React.memo (or memo) to prevent unnecessary re‑rendering.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that useCallback is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders  
  Multiple event handlers (e.g., handleKeyDown, onToggle, onEdit) utilize useCallback to optimize performance.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that localStorage handling is implemented in a modern way  
  The initial state is retrieved from localStorage and persistence is managed via a dedicated persist helper, ensuring a modern approach to localStorage.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure the code follows consistent naming conventions throughout the application  
  Naming conventions are consistently applied (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components, uppercase constants for key codes).

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that proper error handling is implemented where necessary  
  The code includes error handling, such as throwing a descriptive error in index.tsx if the #root element is missing.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that the Redux store is configured with appropriate middleware  
  The Redux store is configured using Redux Toolkit’s configureStore, which automatically sets up the necessary middleware.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure that React.lazy is used for code splitting where appropriate  
  Code splitting is implemented using React.lazy and Suspense in App.tsx for the Todos feature.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that the codebase has no TODOs remaining  
  The provided answer explicitly states that no TODO comments remain and no placeholder code is found in the source.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that the Redux Provider wraps the application entry point  
  In index.tsx, the application is wrapped with the Provider component to supply the Redux store to the component hierarchy.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure strict TypeScript type checking is implemented throughout the application  
  TypeScript’s strict mode is enabled (strict: true in tsconfig.json), and strong type annotations are applied consistently.
