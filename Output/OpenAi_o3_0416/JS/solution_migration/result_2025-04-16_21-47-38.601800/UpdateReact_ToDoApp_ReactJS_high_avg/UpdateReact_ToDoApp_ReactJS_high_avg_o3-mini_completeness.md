# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The Header componentâ€™s input field listens for the Enter key (key code 13) and dispatches the addTodo action upon detection.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The TodoList component uses a selector function that filters todos based on the current filter set in the redux state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  The Todos component includes an input checkbox (with id "toggle-all") that triggers the toggleAll action, allowing all todos' completion statuses to be toggled.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  The TodoItem component provides checkboxes to toggle completion, double-click functionality to enter edit mode, and a destroy button for deletion.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  The label in the TodoItem component has an onDoubleClick handler that sets the component into editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  Within the TodoItem component, the onKeyDown event handler checks for the Enter key and submits the edited todo by dispatching the editTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  In the TodoItem component, pressing the Escape key cancels editing and resets the text to the original todo title.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooter component displays the active todo count using a dedicated element with dynamic text to account for singular or plural "item(s)".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The footer provides three links corresponding to "All", "Active", and "Completed" filters with visual indication (using classNames for selection).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  The TodoFooter component conditionally renders a "Clear completed" button when there are completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  The todosSlice retrieves the initial state from localStorage and persists any changes back using a helper function.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  The Todos component conditionally renders UI sections such as the main section (if there are todos) and the footer (if there are active or completed todos).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  The TodoFooter component chooses between "item" and "items" based on the active count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The application is broken down into modular components like Header, TodoList, TodoItem, and TodoFooter, facilitating maintainability and clarity.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The project structure organizes files by features (e.g., the todos feature in its own folder) and by application-wide concerns (e.g., app, hooks, store), adhering to a clean and logical folder layout.
