# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration  
  The provided project uses Create React App with the TypeScript template and utilizes ReactDOM.createRoot, which is indicative of React 18.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure  
  While the code is fully typed and uses TypeScript (e.g., using the Note type from the shared types file), there is no explicit TypeScript interface defined for the audio mapping structure. Instead, the audioMap is constructed and typed via inline object inference using useMemo. This does not meet the explicit requirement of using a dedicated interface.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks  
  All components (PianoKey, ToggleButtons, FullscreenButton, Piano, and App) are implemented as functional components, and several React hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo, useCallback) are used throughout.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)  
  The application manages state (e.g., active notes and toggle mode) with useState and initializes/cleans up event listeners with useEffect correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels  
  Keyboard event handlers are implemented in the Piano component using window event listeners for keydown and keyup events, which is appropriate for a global key handler.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events  
  The PianoKey component uses React’s synthetic events (onMouseDown, onMouseEnter, onMouseUp, and onMouseLeave). Although there isn’t an explicit onMouseMove handler, the onMouseEnter handler with a check for e.buttons effectively serves the purpose of handling drag actions. Minor ambiguity in naming reduces confidence slightly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment  
  Audio objects are instantiated within a useMemo hook to ensure they are created once, and the playback logic correctly resets the currentTime before playing, which is an appropriate management strategy.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility  
  The FullscreenButton component implements fullscreen toggling by conditionally calling requestFullscreen and exitFullscreen using optional chaining. This covers browser compatibility in a concise manner.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns  
  The code applies conditional classes using the classNames utility in both PianoKey and ToggleButtons components, which is a modern React pattern.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate  
  The PianoKey component is wrapped with React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders when its props do not change.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations  
  The application handles audio playback by creating audio elements once and managing active note state, with proper cleanup of keyboard event listeners ensuring adherence to React lifecycle methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application  
  The codebase consistently uses TypeScript with explicit prop types and type annotations, ensuring strong type safety across the application.
