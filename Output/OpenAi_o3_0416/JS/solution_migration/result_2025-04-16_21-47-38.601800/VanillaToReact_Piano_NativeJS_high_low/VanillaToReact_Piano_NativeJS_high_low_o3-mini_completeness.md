# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'.  
  The App component contains a header with an h1 element whose content is "Virtual Piano".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons.  
  The ToggleButtons component renders two buttons labeled "Notes" and "Letters" within a container.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys).  
  The Piano component maps over the KEYS array for natural keys and uses FULL_KEY_LIST for the sharp (overlay) keys, ensuring all keys are rendered.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes.  
  In PianoKey, the div element includes data attributes such as data-letter and data-note extracted from the key info.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked.  
  The Piano component creates an audio element for each note using useMemo and plays the audio from the corresponding file when a key is clicked or activated via keyboard events.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed).  
  Active keys have the 'piano-key-active' class applied based on the activeNotes state, which is updated during play/release events.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes.  
  The Piano component sets up keydown and keyup event listeners that map keyboard letters to the correct piano note, triggering play and release functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked.  
  The App component passes the mode to the Piano component via the showLetters prop. The ToggleButtons component allows the user to change the mode, and Piano displays either the note or the letter accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes.  
  The FullscreenButton component toggles fullscreen mode based on the current state of document.fullscreenElement, using requestFullscreen and exitFullscreen.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly.  
  The application uses a Set to manage active notes which prevents duplicate plays and supports concurrent key presses.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys.  
  The PianoKey componentâ€™s onMouseEnter handler checks for a pressed mouse button (e.buttons === 1) to allow for dragging functionality when moving across keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information.  
  The App component includes a footer that displays "2020" inside a footer container.
