# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18.x
  
  The code clearly uses React 18, as evidenced by the use of `createRoot` in the `index.tsx` file:
  ```tsx
  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
    document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement
  );
  ```
  This is the React 18 way of rendering applications, replacing the older `ReactDOM.render()` method.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript for type safety
  
  TypeScript is used throughout the application, with all files having `.ts` or `.tsx` extensions. We can see explicit type annotations, interfaces (like `Todo`, `TodosState`), and TypeScript-specific syntax throughout the codebase.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for state management
  
  Redux Toolkit is indeed used, with the `createSlice` function properly implemented in `todosSlice.ts`:
  ```ts
  const todosSlice = createSlice({
    name: 'todos',
    initialState,
    reducers: {
      // reducers defined here
    },
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm nanoid is used for generating unique IDs
  
  The application imports and uses nanoid from Redux Toolkit:
  ```ts
  import { createSlice, PayloadAction, nanoid } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
  ```
  And it's used when creating new todos:
  ```ts
  prepare: (title: string) => ({
    payload: { id: nanoid(), title: title.trim(), completed: false } as Todo,
  }),
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code uses functional components with hooks instead of class components
  
  All components are defined as functional components using the React FC type, and they utilize hooks like useState, useEffect, useRef, and custom hooks (useAppDispatch, useAppSelector). No class components are present in the codebase.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains the same routing functionality with proper route handling
  
  The routing functionality is correctly implemented using react-router-dom with HashRouter:
  ```tsx
  <HashRouter>
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/:filter" element={<TodoApp />} />
      <Route path="*" element={<Navigate to="/all" replace />} />
    </Routes>
  </HashRouter>
  ```
  The code also handles hash-based routes (/all, /active, /completed) and redirects unknown routes to the default route.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Redux store is properly configured with appropriate slices
  
  The store is correctly configured in `store.ts` with the todos reducer:
  ```ts
  export const store = configureStore({
    reducer: { todos: todosReducer },
    preloadedState: loadState(),
  });
  ```
  It also properly handles loading and saving state to localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the Redux provider is set up in the application entry point
  
  The Redux Provider is correctly set up in `index.tsx`:
  ```tsx
  root.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
      <Provider store={store}>
        <App />
      </Provider>
    </React.StrictMode>
  );
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for all data structures
  
  TypeScript interfaces and types are properly defined for all data structures, including:
  - Todo interface
  - Filter type
  - TodosState interface
  - RootState and AppDispatch types
  - Props interfaces for components
  - TypedUseSelectorHook for useSelector

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows React best practices for component composition
  
  The code follows good component composition practices:
  - Components are separated by responsibility (Header, TodoList, TodoItem, etc.)
  - Logic is properly divided between UI components and state management
  - Props are passed down appropriately
  - Components are organized in a logical folder structure

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles keyboard events properly (Enter key for creating/updating todos, Escape key for canceling edits)
  
  Keyboard events are properly handled:
  - In Header.tsx for creating new todos with Enter key
  - In TodoItem.tsx for handling Enter (save) and Escape (cancel) during editing

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application maintains local storage persistence if implemented
  
  Local storage persistence is implemented correctly in the store.ts file with loadState and saveState functions, and the store subscribes to state changes to save them to localStorage.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  The code appears to be well-structured and should not produce console errors or warnings during normal operation. However, without actually running the application, I cannot be 100% certain that there are no runtime errors or warnings.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify the application implements proper error handling
  
  Error handling is implemented for local storage operations with try/catch blocks:
  ```ts
  try {
    const raw = localStorage.getItem(STORAGE_KEY);
    return raw ? JSON.parse(raw) : undefined;
  } catch {
    return undefined;
  }
  ```
  The code also handles edge cases like empty todo titles and graceful recovery from storage issues. However, there might be other error scenarios not explicitly covered in the code.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm the code is optimized with no unnecessary re-renders
  
  The code appears to be optimized with appropriate use of hooks:
  - useEffect with proper dependency arrays
  - Component splitting to minimize re-renders
  - State management through Redux

  However, without profiling the actual running application, it's difficult to be 100% certain there are no unnecessary re-renders in all edge cases.
