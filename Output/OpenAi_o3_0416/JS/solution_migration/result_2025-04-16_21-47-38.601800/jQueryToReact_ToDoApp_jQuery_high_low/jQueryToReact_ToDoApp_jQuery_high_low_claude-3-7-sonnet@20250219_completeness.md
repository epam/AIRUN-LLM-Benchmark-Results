# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos
  
  The `Header.tsx` component includes an h1 with "todos" and an input field with id "new-todo" and class "new-todo" that handles creating new todos when Enter is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos
  
  The `TodoApp.tsx` includes a main section with class "main" that contains both a `ToggleAll` component and a `TodoList` component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button
  
  The `TodoItem.tsx` component includes an input checkbox with class "toggle", a label for displaying the title, and a button with class "destroy" for deletion.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode
  
  In `TodoItem.tsx`, the label has an `onDoubleClick` handler that sets the editing state to true, which then renders the edit input field.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The application implements filtering via the `Footer.tsx` component with filter links and the `selectFilteredTodos` selector in the Redux store, with proper routing for `/all`, `/active`, and `/completed`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization
  
  The `Footer.tsx` component displays the active todo count with proper pluralization logic: `<strong>{activeCount}</strong> {plural} left` where `plural` is conditionally "item" or "items".

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter
  
  The `Footer.tsx` component includes filter links wrapped in `<li>` elements with a `selected` class applied to the current filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist
  
  The `Footer.tsx` component conditionally renders a clear-completed button when there are completed todos: `{completed.length > 0 && (<button className="clear-completed"...`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter
  
  The `Header.tsx` component has a `handleKeyUp` function that dispatches the `addTodo` action when Enter is pressed and the input is not empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos
  
  The `TodoItem.tsx` component includes a checkbox that dispatches the `toggleTodo` action when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once
  
  The `ToggleAll.tsx` component dispatches the `toggleAll` action when its checkbox is clicked, affecting all todos at once.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management
  
  The `TodoItem.tsx` component includes editing functionality with a `useEffect` hook that focuses the input field and positions the cursor at the end of the text when editing mode is activated.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos
  
  The `TodoItem.tsx` component has a delete button that dispatches the `deleteTodo` action when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos
  
  The `Footer.tsx` component includes a "Clear completed" button that dispatches the `clearCompleted` action when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status
  
  The application uses the `selectFilteredTodos` selector in `todosSlice.ts` which returns the appropriate todos based on the current filter state, and this is properly connected to the router.
