# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos  
  The Header component renders an <h1> with the title "todos" and an input field (with id "new-todo") to capture new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle‑all checkbox and a list of todos  
  The TodoApp component contains a <main> element that renders both the ToggleAll component and the TodoList component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button  
  Each TodoItem renders an input of type "checkbox" for toggling, a label for displaying the todo title, and a button (with class "destroy") to delete the todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode  
  The TodoItem component listens for a double-click on the label to trigger an editing state, which brings up the in‑place editor.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  Filtering is implemented via routing in TodoApp and via selectors in the todos slice, allowing the UI to filter todos by all, active, or completed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization  
  The Footer component calculates the count of active todos and adjusts the text to "item" or "items" based on the count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the currently selected filter  
  The Footer component renders links for each filter (all, active, completed) and uses a conditional class ("selected") to indicate the current filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist  
  When there are any completed todos, the Footer displays a "Clear completed" button that dispatches an action to clear them.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter  
  The Header component listens for the "Enter" key on the input field and dispatches an action to add a new todo if the input is non-empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos  
  In the TodoItem component, the checkbox toggles the completion state by dispatching a toggleTodo action.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once  
  The ToggleAll component dispatches the toggleAll action on change; however, the checked state logic is flawed. The code calculates the "allCompleted" variable as:  
  • activeTodos.length === 0 && activeTodos.length !== 0  
  This condition is always false—even when there are todos and all are completed—because the second part (activeTodos.length !== 0) prevents the checkbox from being checked correctly.  
  Confidence is 90% because while the intention to toggle all todos exists, the computed condition for the checkbox status is contradictory.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management  
  When editing is enabled in TodoItem, a useEffect hook sets focus to the editing input and adjusts the selection range properly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos  
  The TodoItem component includes a "destroy" button which dispatches the deleteTodo action when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos  
  The Footer component conditionally displays a "Clear completed" button that dispatches the clearCompleted action, allowing the removal of all completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status  
  The todos slice provides selectors (selectFilteredTodos, selectActiveTodos, selectCompletedTodos) that correctly filter todos based on the selected filter, ensuring the UI displays the appropriate set of todos.
