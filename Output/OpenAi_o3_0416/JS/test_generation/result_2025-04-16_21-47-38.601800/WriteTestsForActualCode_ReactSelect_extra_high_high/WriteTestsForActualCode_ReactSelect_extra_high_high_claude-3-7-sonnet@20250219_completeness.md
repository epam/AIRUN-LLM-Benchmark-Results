# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present
- **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented
- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested
- **Fail** (95%): Validate tests for loading and error states

    While the test suite is comprehensive, I couldn't find explicit tests for loading states. The answer mentions a loading indicator in the list of components that should be tested ("indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)"), but no specific test for loading or error states is provided in the code samples.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance
- **Pass** (90%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested

    While focus management is tested indirectly through keyboard navigation tests and ARIA tests, there aren't extensive explicit tests focused solely on focus management across all interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering
- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations

    The provided test suite doesn't include any tests for custom formatOptionLabel implementations, which was a specific evaluation step.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)

    While onChange is tested in the controlled component test, the test suite doesn't explicitly test onInputChange, onMenuOpen, or onMenuClose callbacks, which were included in the evaluation criteria.

- **Fail** (95%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)

    Tests for the clear indicator are included, but there are no explicit tests for dropdown indicators or loading indicators.
