# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up in the test file  
  The provided test suite includes a complete Jest configuration (jest.config.js), proper TypeScript support (ts-jest), and the necessary setup for React Testing Library through the setupTests.ts file. All required dev-dependencies are installed and configured.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test cases are properly isolated and do not have interdependencies  
  Each test file and even each test case creates its own instance of the rendered component using shared helper functions (e.g., renderSelect), ensuring that tests do not leak state or affect each other.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that DOM events are simulated using proper React Testing Library methods  
  The tests simulate user interactions (mouse clicks, keyboard events, and touch events) using userEvent and RTLâ€™s methods such as click, keyboard, and type. This indicates a proper method of interacting with the DOM.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that accessibility attributes are being tested appropriately  
  Accessibility properties are verified through attributes like aria-invalid, accessible names, and even by performing axe accessibility checks. Additionally, aria-live regions and role assignments (e.g., role="status") are checked.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure mocks are used for external dependencies where appropriate  
  The test suite demonstrates the use of mocks for external dependencies, such as file mocks (test/__mocks__/fileMock.js), ReactDOM portals, and matchMedia polyfill, ensuring the test environment simulates external behaviors correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of async/await for asynchronous testing where needed  
  Several test cases are declared async and make appropriate use of await when simulating keyboard and mouse events with userEvent. This is important to handle async updates in the component correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all assertions use appropriate Jest matchers  
  The tests employ a variety of Jest matchers such as toBeInTheDocument, toHaveTextContent, toHaveAttribute, toHaveValue, and toHaveNoViolations, ensuring that assertions are both descriptive and appropriate.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that tests include proper cleanup after each test case  
  Although explicit cleanup functions (like afterEach) are not called, React Testing Library performs automatic cleanup between tests (especially when using modern versions). The tests rely on these best practices ensuring no residual state remains.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test descriptions clearly indicate what functionality is being tested  
  The test cases are organized within clear describe/it blocks with descriptive titles that indicate the intent (e.g., "renders with default props", "ArrowDown opens menu and focuses first option").

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the test file follows best practices for organizing test cases (describe/it blocks)  
  The provided suite is well structured with logical grouping of tests by functionality (rendering, interactions, state management, a11y, etc.) which follows recognized best practices in test organization.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that all event handlers are tested using appropriate simulation methods  
  The test cases accurately simulate a variety of events (click, keyboard, touch) using userEvent and direct event dispatching with TouchEvent for mobile interaction scenarios, covering a broad range of event handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the test environment correctly simulates both mouse and keyboard interactions  
  The tests clearly simulate both mouse clicks (user.click) and keyboard interactions (user.keyboard) using React Testing Library's recommended userEvent module, ensuring robust interaction testing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for touch events properly simulate mobile interactions  
  The suite contains tests that simulate touch events by dispatching touchstart and touchend events on DOM elements, which verifies mobile interaction behavior correctly.
