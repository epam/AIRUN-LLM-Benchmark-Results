# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist  
  The test file "Select.render.test.tsx" contains a test case that renders the component with default props and verifies the presence of the combobox and default placeholder.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present  
  Although tests for ArrowDown, ArrowUp, Enter, and Escape are implemented, no test case explicitly covers the use of the Tab key for keyboard navigation.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)  
  The provided test suite includes mouse click interactions and even touch events. However, there is no test that explicitly verifies hovering behavior, which is part of the checklist.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior  
  The tests include a controlled component test ("works as a controlled component") and state management for multi‑select behavior. There is no explicit test demonstrating uncontrolled behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values  
  The state management tests cover selecting an option, removing a value via Backspace, and clearing via the clear‑indicator.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented  
  Several tests address menu opening (via arrow keys or clicks) and closing (using Escape and clicking outside), ensuring menu behavior is covered.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality  
  The "Select.menu.test.tsx" file contains tests for filtering by input and using a custom filter function.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi‑select behavior exist  
  The multi‑select functionality is tested in the state management test where selecting multiple options is followed by removing individual selections.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility  
  The a11y tests include checks for axe violations and verify that aria-live regions update correctly on selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested  
  An edge‑case test explicitly verifies that an empty options list shows a "No options" message.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states  
  There are no tests covering loading states or error conditions in the provided test suite.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states  
  The edge‑case tests include a scenario to ensure that a disabled option is marked correctly and remains unselected upon interaction.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance  
  A performance test verifies that rendering 1,000 options takes less than 100 ms, which meets the performance requirement.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested  
  Focus management is indirectly tested through keyboard navigation (e.g., ensuring the first option is focused upon opening the menu). Although not exhaustive, the tests do partially cover focus behavior.  
  Explanation: A more explicit focus test (e.g., directly asserting which element has focus) could improve confidence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering  
  The test suite confirms the default placeholder ("Select…") is rendered and validates the combobox value after selection.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations  
  There is no test provided that verifies custom rendering logic via a formatOptionLabel prop.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)  
  The tests cover the onChange callback. However, there are no tests for onInputChange, onMenuOpen, or onMenuClose callback functions.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)  
  While the clear indicator is tested via clicking on the element with aria‑label "Clear value", there are no tests for dropdown or loading indicator components.
