# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)  
  The test‐suite uses Jasmine for BDD-style tests and Karma as the test runner which qualifies as modern testing frameworks.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints  
  The tests for the REST factory setup a $resource spy that captures endpoints and actions, demonstrating proper mocking of REST API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation  
  The test files consistently use beforeEach hooks (and clear localStorage where needed) to ensure fresh test states and proper dependency injection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls  
  With angular-mocks and the dedicated REST mocks, the tests effectively simulate HTTP requests without invoking real API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection  
  Every test module loads dependencies via module() and inject() methods, ensuring that AngularJS DI is correctly applied.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations  
  The tests simulate promise-based behavior (e.g., using $q.resolve in the translate mock) and use callbacks in REST actions. Although explicit asynchronous handling (such as calling $scope.$apply or flush) is not visibly needed due to the synchronous resolution in mocks, this may hide subtleties in truly asynchronous scenarios.  
  Explanation: The asynchronous operations appear to be handled through the promise mechanisms provided by AngularJS mocks, but explicit flushing isn’t done. This yields a high confidence while leaving a slight uncertainty in more complex asynchronous cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies  
  Jasmine’s spyOn and createSpy methods are used throughout the tests to monitor and simulate external dependencies (such as locals, $resource, and $broadcast).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization  
  All test cases are well organized using the describe and it structure, making the intent of every test case clear.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls  
  The test suite includes validations for both positive (happy path) and negative scenarios (guard clauses and invalid inputs) for API calls and user inputs.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate  
  The tests simulate user-driven changes (like title changes and URL modifications) by directly updating scope values and invoking related functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage  
  Local storage and scope creation are explicitly cleared or re-initialized between tests to ensure no residual state contaminates subsequent tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested  
  All describe and it blocks are named with clear, descriptive titles, making it straightforward to understand the purpose of each test.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible  
  The tests consistently check the output (such as URL changes, property values, broadcast messages, and redirection) rather than relying overly on internal implementation details.
