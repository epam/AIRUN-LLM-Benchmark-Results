# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering
- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos
- **Fail** (95%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos

    The app.tsx test file covers component rendering, adding new todos, and toggling all todos, but does not explicitly test filtering todos. The test suite tests the filter navigation in the footer component, but doesn't validate that the filtering functionality works in the main app.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos

    The app.tsx test file doesn't include tests for clearing completed todos. This functionality is tested in the footer component and the todoModel, but not in an end-to-end context in the app tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events
- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts
- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation
- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data
- **Fail** (90%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented

    While the solution includes a mock for Router in the jest.setup.ts file, there are no explicit tests for routing functionality. The footer test checks if the correct filter link has the 'selected' class, but doesn't verify that the routing correctly changes the displayed todos based on filter selection.
