# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up with TypeScript support  
  The provided answer includes installation of Jest, ts‑jest, TypeScript types, and testing libraries for React, which confirms full TypeScript support.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test configuration files (jest.config.js, setupFilesAfterEnv in jest.setup.ts) are properly configured  
  The answer includes a complete jest.config.js with correct preset, test environment, module name mapping, global mocks setup in jest.setup.ts, and coverage thresholds, ensuring proper configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use proper isolation with no dependencies between test cases  
  Each test module clears or resets global states (e.g., localStorage.clear() and jest.clearAllMocks()) in beforeEach hooks, ensuring that tests run in isolation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mocks are implemented for external dependencies and browser APIs (localStorage)  
  Global stubs and mocks are clearly provided for localStorage, Router, and certain DOM APIs (such as setSelectionRange and focus), ensuring external dependencies are properly isolated.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that component lifecycle methods are properly tested  
  The tests simulate component initialization and user interactions (e.g., editing mode toggling) which implies that lifecycle methods or side‑effects are triggered and observed accordingly.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure tests verify both happy paths and edge cases/error conditions  
  The tests thoroughly cover the standard (happy) paths, such as creating, toggling, and deleting todos, and also test UI interactions (like editing behavior). However, explicit error conditions or less common edge cases are not directly addressed, which slightly lowers the confidence level.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use proper describe/it blocks structure for readability  
  The test files are organized with clear describe and it/test blocks, providing a logical structure for each component and module.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm assertions include meaningful error messages  
  While the tests rely on standard assertion libraries (e.g., expect(...).toBe...), the assertions are clear and the use of specific matcher functions (e.g., toHaveClass, toBeInTheDocument) aids in diagnosing failures.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that event handling tests correctly simulate user interactions  
  Event handling is accurately simulated using @testing-library/user-event, with tests verifying events like clicks, double‑clicks, key presses (ENTER, ESC), and their results.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests achieve minimum 80% code coverage across all components  
  The jest.config.js enforces a global coverage threshold of 80% on branches, functions, lines, and statements, ensuring that the tests meet the minimum coverage requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for UI components verify proper rendering based on props/state  
  Tests for components such as TodoFooter and TodoItem check the rendered output (e.g., correct text, class names, and element properties) based on various prop values and states.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for data management verify proper state updates  
  The tests for TodoModel validate that state-altering methods (addTodo, toggle, destroy, save, clearCompleted) update the state as expected and persist data where required.
