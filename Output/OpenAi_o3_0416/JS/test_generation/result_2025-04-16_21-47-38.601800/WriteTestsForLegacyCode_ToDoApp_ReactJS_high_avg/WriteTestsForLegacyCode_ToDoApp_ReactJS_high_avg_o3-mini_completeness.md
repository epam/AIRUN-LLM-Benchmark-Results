# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering  
  The app test file (src/app.test.tsx) renders the TodoApp component and checks for the presence of elements (e.g. verifying that added todos appear in the document).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos  
  The test "adds a new todo when ENTER is pressed" in src/app.test.tsx confirms that new todos are added.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos  
  The test "toggles all todos via master checkbox" in src/app.test.tsx checks that toggling the master checkbox marks all todos as completed.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos  
  There is no test in the app.tsx file that directly verifies filtering functionality. Filtering is instead indirectly tested via the footer component tests.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The app.tsx test file does not contain a test for clearing completed todos. Although the footer tests check the "Clear completed" button, this functionality is not directly verified by tests in app.tsx.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering  
  The test "renders label & checkbox according to props" in src/todoItem.test.tsx confirms that rendering works as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos  
  The todoItem.test.tsx file includes tests that cover toggling (via checkbox click), editing (double‑click and save), and destroying a todo (clicking the destroy button).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events  
  Keyboard interactions are tested (ENTER to save and ESC to cancel) in the todoItem tests, confirming proper handling of keyboard events.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts  
  The footer tests check that the item count is displayed correctly with proper pluralization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation  
  The footer tests include a verification for highlighting the current filter by checking for the 'selected' CSS class.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The test "renders 'Clear completed' button when completedCount > 0" in the footer tests simulates clicking the button and confirms the clear completed functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos  
  The todoModel tests cover addTodo, toggle, save, and destroy functions, ensuring that todos are added, toggled, updated, and removed as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions  
  The test "subscribe() + inform() call subscriber" in the todoModel test file confirms that the notification mechanism works.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The test "clearCompleted() drops only completed todos" validates that only completed items are removed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation  
  The test "creates a RFC‑ish uuid with 36 chars & dashes" ensures that the uuid function generates a valid id.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality  
  The pluralize functionality is tested by verifying correct singular and plural forms.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations  
  The tests check that JSON is correctly stored and retrieved from localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function  
  The extend function is tested using a shallow merge, confirming it produces the expected object.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx  
  All test files follow the convention (*.test.tsx or *.test.ts) as seen in the provided structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data  
  A sample todo fixture (sampleTodo) is defined in todoItem.test.tsx and used for various tests.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented  
  Although global mocks for Router and some DOM APIs are set up in jest.setup.ts, there are no explicit tests verifying routing functionality.
