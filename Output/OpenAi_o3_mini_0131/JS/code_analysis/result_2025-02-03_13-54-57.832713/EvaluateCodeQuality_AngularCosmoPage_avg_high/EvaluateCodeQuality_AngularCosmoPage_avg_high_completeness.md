# Evaluation Report

## Readability

### 1. Overly Verbose Controller Functions
**Pass**: The suggestion to extract specific business logic into smaller, named functions or services is valid and improves readability.

### 2. Duplicated LocalStorage Element Handling
**Pass**: The recommendation to create a helper function or service for localStorage operations is appropriate and enhances maintainability.

## Maintainability

### 1. Hard-Coded REST Endpoints in the Factory
**Pass**: Extracting a configuration object for API endpoints is a good practice and simplifies future updates.

### 2. Large Controller with Multiple Responsibilities
**Pass**: Splitting the controller into multiple controllers or components improves reusability and clarity.

## Performance

### 1. Repeated Access to localStorage in Loops
**Pass**: Caching localStorage values in a temporary object before iterating is a valid optimization.

### 2. Inefficient Loops for Saving Extras
**Pass**: Refactoring to allow for batch saves and using `Promise.all` for parallel requests is a good performance improvement.

## Accessibility

### 1. Missing ARIA Attributes and Semantic HTML Enhancements
**Pass**: Adding ARIA labels and roles to buttons and interactive elements enhances accessibility.

### 2. Incorrect Input Attribute and Label Associations
**Pass**: Correcting the typo and ensuring proper form field associations improves accessibility.

## Best Practices

### 1. Use of Deprecated or Incorrect Attributes
**Pass**: Fixing the typo from `ng-modal` to `ng-model` is necessary for proper data binding.

### 2. Lack of Component-Based Structure
**Pass**: Using the component method in AngularJS 1.x applications is a best practice for better encapsulation and testability.

## Testing

### 1. Difficulty to Unit Test Large Monolithic Controllers
**Pass**: Separating business logic into services and using `controllerAs` syntax makes unit testing easier.

## Documentation

### 1. Improving In-Code Comments and Documentation
**Pass**: Using JSDoc for clear and consistent documentation helps in understanding and maintaining the code.
