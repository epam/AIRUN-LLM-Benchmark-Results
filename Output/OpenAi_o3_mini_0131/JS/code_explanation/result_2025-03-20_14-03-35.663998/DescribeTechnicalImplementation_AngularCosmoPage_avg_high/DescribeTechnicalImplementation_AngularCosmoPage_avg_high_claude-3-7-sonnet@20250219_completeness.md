- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all major components (REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and Page controller) are documented
  
  All major components are thoroughly documented in section 3 "Detailed Component Features", with subsections A-E covering REST Factory, Page Factory, Users Factory, Page Controller, and HTML Template.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure all significant features of the page management system are described
  
  The documentation extensively covers all significant features including page creation, editing, deletion, draft recovery, URL auto-generation, tag suggestions, and revision handling across multiple sections.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all form inputs and their behavior are documented
  
  Section 4 "Interface Specifications" includes a detailed table of all form inputs (properties/parameters) with their data types, descriptions, and whether they're required. Additionally, the behavior of these inputs is described in sections 3 and 5.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page versioning and revision system
  
  The documentation explains the revision system in multiple places, notably in section 3.D where it mentions "Handles saving logic for both new pages and page updates, including: Creating and updating content, Storing page revisions and extra data..." and in section 5.D explaining revisions handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation covers the tag system and autocomplete functionality
  
  The tag system and autocomplete functionality are well documented in section 3.D (Page Controller features) and again in section 5.D (Common Use Cases and Patterns) where it specifically mentions "Tag Autocompletion: The user edits the tags field and gets suggestions dynamically from REST.contentTags.query."

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes explanation of error handling and user notifications
  
  The documentation mentions user notifications in section 3.D, stating "Uses Angular's $translate service for multi-language support in notifications" and explaining how the controller implements notification mechanisms.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page publishing workflow including scheduling
  
  The publishing workflow including scheduling is documented in section 3.D (explaining how scheduled publish dates are set) and in section 4's interface specifications table which describes the "Page.publish" and "Page.scheduleDate" parameters.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation details how content extras and additional metadata are managed
  
  The documentation addresses content extras and metadata management in section 3.D ("Handles saving logic for both new pages and page updates, including: [...] Storing page revisions and extra data") and in section 5.D ("Revision and Extras Handling: The saving process automatically creates a revision record and then saves extra metadata").

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation explains how the UI interacts with the backend APIs
  
  The documentation clearly explains the interaction between UI and backend APIs through the REST factory explanation in section 3.A, the controller implementation in 3.D, and in the usage documentation in section 5.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes sample usage examples or patterns
  
  Section 5 "Usage Documentation" provides clear examples and patterns, including HTML setup code and explanations of common use cases like creating pages, editing existing pages, auto-generating URLs, and tag autocompletion.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains all significant event broadcasting and inter-component communication
  
  The documentation covers event broadcasting and inter-component communication in section 3.D, specifically mentioning "Employs Angular event broadcasting (e.g., $rootScope.$broadcast('contentGet')) to sync state among components" and explaining how factories serve as shared state objects for communication between components.
