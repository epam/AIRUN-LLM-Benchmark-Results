# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  The component is clearly written as a React functional component and the context mentions React 18.x. While there is no explicit version check in the code, the syntax and hooks used are fully supported in React 18.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  The code uses TypeScript interfaces (such as Option and SearchableSelectProps) and leverages TypeScript’s type checking. This meets the criteria for proper type definitions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  An index.css file is provided with appropriate styling for the component. The file is referenced in the TSX file, confirming its inclusion.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  The provided code is free of any TODO comments and shows a clean, production-ready style with proper naming conventions and structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  The component manages its internal states (such as isOpen, query, and highlightedIndex) using React’s useState hook in an appropriate manner. The selected item is received as a prop, which is a valid pattern for controlled components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  The component accepts customizable props (options, placeholder, onSelect, and selected), making it reusable across different contexts.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  The code includes clearly defined handlers for keyboard events (including Enter, ArrowDown, ArrowUp, and Escape) which enables proper keyboard navigation and selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  The component makes proper use of useRef to handle DOM interactions (for example, containerRef and inputRef) along with a cleanup mechanism in the useEffect hook when listening for click events.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  When the dropdown is closed, the code returns focus to the input element, ensuring that focus management is handled properly and enhances accessibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  The component is equipped with several ARIA attributes (aria-haspopup, aria-expanded, aria-controls, role="combobox", and role="listbox") that improve the accessibility of the UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  There are no indications of console errors or warnings in the provided snippet. The code is crafted to avoid common pitfalls that lead to console issues.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  The implementation is efficient with state management and event handling. There are no extraneous re-renders evident from the code provided. Although the options filtering is done on each render, this is acceptable for typical use cases and is not a source of unnecessary re-rendering.
