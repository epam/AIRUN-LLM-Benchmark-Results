# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component renders a dropdown list (using the <code>ul</code> element with role="listbox") when <code>isOpen</code> is true.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  The component includes an <code>input</code> that supports search functionality. Although the input is rendered in a separate wrapper (not nested inside the dropdown <code>ul</code>), its behavior provides the expected searchable feature when the dropdown is open. There is slight uncertainty in interpretation because “within the dropdown” could be taken literally, but the overall functionality meets the search input requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The component’s design allows selection of one option at a time as reflected by the single <code>onSelect</code> callback invocation and the absence of any multi-selection logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The <code>handleKeyDown</code> function processes both "ArrowDown" and "ArrowUp" keys to adjust the highlighted option.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  When the Enter key is pressed, if the dropdown is open and there are available options, the component selects the currently highlighted item.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  The <code>handleKeyDown</code> function opens the dropdown if it is not open when the Enter key is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  The <code>closeDropdown</code> function explicitly calls <code>focus()</code> on the input element (via <code>inputRef</code>), ensuring focus is returned.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  Clicking an option triggers the <code>onClick</code> handler on the list item, which calls <code>handleSelect</code> and subsequently closes the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  Selecting an option with the Enter key in the open state calls <code>handleSelect</code>, which in turn closes the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  The Escape key event in <code>handleKeyDown</code> calls <code>closeDropdown</code>, closing the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  An event listener on document clicks in the <code>useEffect</code> hook checks if the click is outside the <code>containerRef</code> and, if so, closes the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  When the input receives focus and the Enter key is pressed while the dropdown is closed, the component calls <code>openDropdown</code> to display the list.
