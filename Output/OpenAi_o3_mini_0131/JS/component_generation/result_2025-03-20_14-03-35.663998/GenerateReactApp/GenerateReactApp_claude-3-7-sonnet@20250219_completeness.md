# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The code fetches character data from the SWAPI (Star Wars API) using Axios and displays the characters in a list. The API endpoint used is 'https://swapi.dev/api/people', which is the correct endpoint for fetching Star Wars characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The code includes a loading state that is initially set to true and is displayed while the API request is in progress. The loading state is set to false once the data is fetched or an error occurs.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The characters fetched from the API are stored in the 'characters' state and displayed in the UI through the CharacterList component, which maps over all characters and renders each one as a list item.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  There are no search bars, input fields, or any other user input functionality in the provided code. The application simply fetches and displays data without any search capabilities.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character is rendered in a list item displaying the character's name: `<li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The application structure follows the Create React App (CRA) template, with appropriate file structure (index.tsx, App.tsx) and package.json including react-scripts and other CRA dependencies. Instructions also explicitly mention using Create React App.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The application properly manages three states:
  - A characters state for storing the fetched data
  - A loading state for tracking API request progress
  - An error state for handling and displaying errors

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each list item has a unique key using the character's URL: `<li key={character.url}>`. Since URLs in the Star Wars API are unique identifiers, this ensures optimal rendering by React.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  The application handles all possible states appropriately:
  - Loading state with a loading indicator
  - Error state with an error message
  - Empty characters array would simply render an empty list (implied by the mapping logic)
