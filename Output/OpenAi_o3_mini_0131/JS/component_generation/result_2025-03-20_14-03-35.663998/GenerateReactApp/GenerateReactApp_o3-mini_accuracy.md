# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses React 18.x or newer by checking the package.json dependencies  
  The package.json lists "react": "^18.2.0" and "react-dom": "^18.2.0", confirming that the application uses React 18.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that TypeScript is properly implemented with appropriate type definitions for all components, props, and states  
  The code defines interfaces (e.g., for Character) and correctly types component props and states (using React.FC and generics in useState), showing proper implementation of TypeScript.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Axios is used for API requests to fetch data from the Star Wars API endpoint  
  Axios is imported and used in the useEffect hook to perform a GET request to the SWAPI endpoint.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles API errors gracefully with appropriate error states or messages  
  The .catch block sets an error state which is then rendered to display "Error fetching data" when an API call fails.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the character data is fetched on component mount using the useEffect hook  
  The useEffect hook with an empty dependency array ensures that the API call is made once when the component mounts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application properly manages component rendering optimization  
  The CharacterList component is wrapped in React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders, improving performance.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows React best practices using hooks appropriately  
  The code leverages React hooks (useState, useEffect) correctly for state management and side effects, adhering to best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't contain any TODO comments or unnecessary code  
  The code is clean and free from any TODO comments or extraneous code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the codebase has minimal comments that only clarify complex logic when necessary  
  The code includes minimal comments, focusing on clarity without adding clutter.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the API endpoint 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' is being called correctly  
  The GET request explicitly targets 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' with the expected type structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application renders without console errors or warnings  
  Based on the provided code structure and standard Create React App setup, there are no apparent errors or warnings that would disrupt rendering.
