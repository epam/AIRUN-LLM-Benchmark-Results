# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The code fetches character data from the SWAPI endpoint and passes the results to the CharacterList component which maps and displays each character.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The application returns a <div>Loading...</div> while the loading state is true, fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  After fetching the data, all characters contained in the response are set into state and are rendered in the list.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  There is no search box or any user input element; the focus is entirely on fetching and rendering data.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each <li> element displays the character's name, which is extracted from the API response, ensuring proper presentation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The presence of react-scripts and the provided instructions confirm that the project uses Create React App with the TypeScript template.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The component utilizes useState hooks for managing characters, loading, and error, and updates these states appropriately based on API outcomes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  Unique keys are provided to each list item using the characterâ€™s URL, which meets the requirement for optimal rendering practices.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  In cases where the API returns an empty result, the app will display an empty list under the "Star Wars Characters" heading. Although it gracefully avoids errors, it does not provide a specific message (e.g., "No characters found"). The solution is acceptable, but the handling could be more explicit, hence a slightly lower confidence rating.
