# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type  
  The input field's onChange handler calls setQuery(e.target.value), which correctly updates the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls  
  A debounce mechanism is implemented using setTimeout with a 500ms delay, ensuring API calls occur only after the user pauses typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured  
  The code imports axios and uses axios.get with a typed response, correctly handling the API request.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses  
  TypeScript typings are provided for components, states, API responses (SWAPIResponse), and character data.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters  
  The endpoint is constructed using template literals (https://swapi.dev/api/people/?search=${searchQuery}) to include the search parameter.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate  
  The fetchCharacters function is wrapped in useCallback to avoid unnecessary re-creations on each render.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback  
  A try/catch block is used to handle API call errors, with an error message set in state and displayed to the user.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing  
  The debounce implemented in the useEffect hook ensures that API calls are made only after a 500ms pause in typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices  
  useState is appropriately used for managing search query, character results, loading state, and error handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code  
  The provided code is clean, with no commented-out code or unused imports; the only console output is a deliberate error log.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests  
  The code sets loading to true before the request and resets it back to false in a finally block, ensuring correct management of the loading state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns  
  The implementation uses functional components with React.FC, hooks, and an error boundary (the latter still uses a class component as recommended for error boundaries), which align with current React 18.x design patterns.
