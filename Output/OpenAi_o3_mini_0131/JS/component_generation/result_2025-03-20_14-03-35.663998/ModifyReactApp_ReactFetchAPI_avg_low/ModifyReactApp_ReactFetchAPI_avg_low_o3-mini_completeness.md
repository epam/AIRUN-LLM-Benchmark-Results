# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The provided code includes an input element with a placeholder "Search characters...", which updates the query state and filters the characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  The code conditionally renders a loading indicator ("Loading...") when the loading state is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  An initial API call is made when the component mounts (query state is initially empty), as observed in the useEffect hook.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  The search functionality is implemented with a debounced call (500ms delay) based on the query state, ensuring that search results update dynamically.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  When there are no characters returned (i.e., characters array is empty), the code displays "No characters found" to inform the user.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The component uses inline styles (e.g., maxWidth of 600px, margin auto, responsive padding) to ensure a reasonably responsive design. However, while these inline styles support responsiveness, more advanced responsive techniques (such as media queries) are not used, hence the confidence is at 90%.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  The code maps over the characters array and renders each character in a list, confirming that search results are properly displayed after receiving data.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  An ErrorBoundary component is defined and used to wrap the CharacterList, catching and handling errors in the component tree.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The code defines TypeScript interfaces for a SWAPI Character and SWAPIResponse, and it also properly types the component props in the ErrorBoundary and App components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The updated solution incorporates search functionality via the query state and debounced API calls without compromising the initial functionality for fetching and displaying default characters.
