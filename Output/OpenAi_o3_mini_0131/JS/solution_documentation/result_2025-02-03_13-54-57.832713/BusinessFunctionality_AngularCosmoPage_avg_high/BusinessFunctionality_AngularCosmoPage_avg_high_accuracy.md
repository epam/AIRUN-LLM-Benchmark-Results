# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### 1. Ensure that the application uses `$resource` objects for RESTful API communication.
**Pass**: The code defines a service layer (the REST factory) that encapsulates all RESTful API calls for various resources using `$resource`.

### 2. Verify that the application saves page changes to local storage.
**Pass**: The application stores unsaved changes in `localStorage`, ensuring that data is not lost between sessions.

### 3. Confirm that the application initializes the page type correctly.
**Pass**: The page factory (Page) holds global variables for page data, including the page type, which is initialized correctly.

### 4. Validate that the application manages local storage for unsaved changes.
**Pass**: The application checks for unsaved versions from previous sessions in `localStorage` and notifies the user accordingly.

### 5. Verify that the application handles errors during saving or updating pages.
**Pass**: The controller implements saving logic that notifies the user about success or errors via broadcast events and translation services.

### 6. Confirm that the application broadcasts events to update page variables and settings when necessary.
**Pass**: The application uses `$rootScope.$broadcast` to update components dynamically, ensuring that the UI stays in sync.

### 7. Validate that the application uses promises and callbacks for asynchronous operations.
**Pass**: REST calls for saving revisions, extras, and tags are executed asynchronously, allowing for responsiveness.

### 8. Validate that the application broadcasts notifications for various operations (e.g., page saving, updating, deleting).
**Pass**: The application uses Angular’s translation ($translate) and notification mechanisms to provide timely feedback for various operations.

### 9. Verify that the application supports scalability and maintainability through modular design.
**Pass**: The code is structured to separate concerns (factories for REST, Page, and Users), which helps scalability and maintainability.

### 10. Confirm that the application optimizes performance through efficient API usage and local storage management.
**Pass**: The use of AngularJS’s `$resource` simplifies REST API interactions, and local storage is used to cache unsaved changes, optimizing performance.
