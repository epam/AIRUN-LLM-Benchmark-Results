  The use of localStorage to temporarily store unsaved changes is clearly documented.

  The documentation covers the editing process, including loading unsaved changes and updating the Page factory.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the page duplication feature  
  The duplication feature is mentioned as part of key functionalities and its handling of duplicate URLs is explained.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains the page deletion process  
  It describes how deletion involves multiple REST calls to remove content, revisions, extras, and tags.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the auto-URL generation from title feature  
  The documentation clearly states that the application auto-generates a URL based on the page title when none is provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains tag management and autocompletion  
  Tag management, including the autocomplete feature for tags, is well detailed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the publication status options (publish, draft, schedule)  
  The documentation lists the radio buttons for selecting the publish status and explains their roles.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains scheduled content publishing  
  It covers the workflow related to scheduled publishing, including the appearance of a date/time input when needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes page revision management  
  The revision system is mentioned as a part of saving and managing page histories.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the handling of page extras and additional data  
  The documentation explains that extras (additional metadata/settings) are handled alongside pages and revisions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes form validation mechanisms  
  It lists the validations such as non-empty title, URL, a selected page type, and duplicate URL checks, along with ng-change usage.

- **Fail** (90%): Validate the documentation explains error handling during API operations  
  While the documentation covers multiple functionalities and validations, it does not explicitly delve into how API errors are handled.  
  (Less than 100% confident because error handling is only implied through validations and confirmation messages, rather than explained in detail.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes notification messaging for user feedback  
  The documentation mentions the “New Version Notification” and confirmation messages before deletion, which serve as user feedback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the theme-specific page types feature  
  The documentation references dropdowns for page types, indicating support for theme-specific templates.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the featured image handling  
  There is no mention of featured image handling in the analysis, which is required by the evaluation step.

- **Pass** (95%): Validate the documentation explains URL validation and error handling
