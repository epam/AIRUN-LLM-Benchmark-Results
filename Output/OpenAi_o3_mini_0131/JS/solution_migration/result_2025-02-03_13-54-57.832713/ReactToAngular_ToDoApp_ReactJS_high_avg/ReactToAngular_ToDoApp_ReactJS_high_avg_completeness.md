# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that the main component displays the header with input for new todos.
- **Pass**: The `app.component.html` contains a header with an input field for new todos.

### Step 2: Ensure that adding a new todo item works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `handleNewTodoKeyDown` method in `AppComponent` handles adding new todos when the Enter key is pressed.

### Step 3: Verify that the todo list displays all added todo items.
- **Pass**: The `app.component.html` uses `*ngFor` to iterate over `filteredTodos` and display each todo item using the `app-todo-item` component.

### Step 4: Confirm that toggle functionality works for marking todos as completed.
- **Pass**: The `toggle` method in `AppComponent` calls the `toggle` method in `TodoModelService`, which updates the todo's completed status.

### Step 5: Check that editing a todo item works and updates the todo item correctly.
- **Pass**: The `edit` and `save` methods in `AppComponent` handle editing and saving todo items. The `todo-item.component.ts` also has the necessary logic to handle editing.

### Step 6: Ensure that deleting a todo item removes it from the list.
- **Pass**: The `destroy` method in `AppComponent` calls the `destroy` method in `TodoModelService`, which removes the todo item from the list.

### Step 7: Verify that the footer correctly displays the count of active items.
- **Pass**: The `app.component.html` includes the `app-todo-footer` component, which displays the count of active items using the `count` input property.

### Step 8: Confirm that the footer's clear completed button works and removes completed items.
- **Pass**: The `clearCompleted` method in `AppComponent` calls the `clearCompleted` method in `TodoModelService`, which removes completed items from the list.

### Step 9: Check that filtering todos by "all", "active", and "completed" works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `filteredTodos` getter in `AppComponent` filters todos based on the `nowShowing` property.

### Step 10: Ensure that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `toggleAll` method in `AppComponent` calls the `toggleAll` method in `TodoModelService`, which marks all todos as complete or incomplete.

### Step 11: Check that the application persists todos to local storage and reloads them correctly.
- **Pass**: The `store` method in `Utils` handles storing and retrieving todos from local storage. The `TodoModelService` initializes the todos from local storage.
