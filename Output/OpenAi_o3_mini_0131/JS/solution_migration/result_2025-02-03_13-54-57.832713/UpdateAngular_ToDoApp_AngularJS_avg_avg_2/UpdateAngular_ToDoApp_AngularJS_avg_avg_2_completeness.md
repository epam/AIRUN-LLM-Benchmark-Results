# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Confirm that the application initializes correctly and loads persisted todos.**
   - **Pass**: The `ngrxOnInitEffects` method in `TodoEffects` dispatches the `loadTodos` action, which loads todos from `localStorage`.

2. **Ensure that the todo list displays correctly and is interactive.**
   - **Pass**: The `TodoListComponent` subscribes to the `selectTodos` selector and displays the todos in the template.

3. **Verify that adding a new todo works correctly.**
   - **Pass**: The `TodoInputComponent` dispatches the `addTodo` action with the new todo title, and the `todoReducer` handles this action to add the new todo to the state.

4. **Check that editing a todo works correctly.**
   - **Pass**: The `TodoListComponent` handles editing by dispatching the `editTodo` action, and the `todoReducer` updates the todo title in the state.

5. **Confirm that toggling a todo item completion status works correctly.**
   - **Pass**: The `TodoListComponent` dispatches the `toggleTodo` action, and the `todoReducer` toggles the completion status of the todo in the state.

6. **Ensure that removing a todo works correctly.**
   - **Pass**: The `TodoListComponent` dispatches the `removeTodo` action, and the `todoReducer` removes the todo from the state.

7. **Verify that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works.**
   - **Pass**: The `TodoListComponent` dispatches the `markAll` action, and the `todoReducer` updates the completion status of all todos in the state.

8. **Check that the filter functionality (All, Active, Completed) works.**
   - **Pass**: The `TodoFooterComponent` sets the current filter and the template displays todos based on the selected filter.

9. **Confirm that the "Clear completed" button works correctly.**
   - **Pass**: The `TodoFooterComponent` dispatches the `clearCompleted` action, and the `todoReducer` removes all completed todos from the state.

10. **Ensure that the application is responsive and functions correctly on different screen sizes.**
    - **Pass**: The application uses standard HTML and CSS practices, and Angular's responsive design capabilities ensure it functions correctly on different screen sizes.
