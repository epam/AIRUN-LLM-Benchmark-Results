# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented

    The code clearly demonstrates page management functionality through the `savePageAsync` thunk which handles both create and update operations, with specific logic for handling duplicates. Delete functionality is referenced in the PageForm component, and the API layer includes `pageAPI.delete()`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present

    Page type selection is implemented in the PageForm component with a select dropdown that maps over `localPage.themePages` to generate options, and proper onChange event handling to update the page type.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists

    URL auto-generation from the title is clearly implemented in the `handleChange` function, which converts the title to a URL-friendly format when the title field is updated and the URL is either 'new' or empty.

- **Fail** (90%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented

    While tag management is partially implemented (the code shows input for tags and conversion between comma-separated string and array), there is no clear implementation of autocomplete suggestions for tags. The `tagAPI` is defined but the autocompletion UI functionality is not visible in the provided code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available

    The code implements publish status options through radio buttons for 'publish' (Y), 'draft' (N), and 'schedule', with proper onChange handlers for each option.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented

    Scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented with a conditional datetime-local input that appears when the 'schedule' option is selected, with proper value binding and onChange handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present

    Local storage functionality is implemented through the custom `useLocalStorage` hook, and the code includes specific UI elements and handlers for comparing, using, or discarding newer versions from local storage.

- **Fail** (95%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented

    While there are basic alert calls for errors (e.g., for missing URL or page type), a comprehensive notification system is not clearly implemented. The code has `alert(t('page_error_saving'))` for save errors, but lacks a more sophisticated notification system for success messages or non-blocking notifications.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present

    Form validation for required fields is implemented in the `handleSubmit` function, which checks for the presence of URL and page type before submission, displaying appropriate error messages when validation fails.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled

    The code defines various API endpoints in the `rest.ts` file, including methods for pages, tags, and users. While it covers the basic operations mentioned, without seeing the original code, I cannot be 100% certain that all endpoints are properly handled, but the implementation appears comprehensive.

- **Fail** (85%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented

    While the IPage interface includes an "extras" field and there is a `deleteExtras` method in the API layer, there is no clear implementation of extras management in the form component. The code doesn't show UI for adding, editing, or managing extras.

- **Fail** (90%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained

    While the code includes `saveRevision` calls in the `savePageAsync` thunk, there is no UI or component for viewing or managing revision history. The backend functionality appears to be there, but the user interface for revision history is not evident in the provided code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components

    The code follows a clear organization with feature folders and proper separation of concerns. Business logic is in Redux slices and API layers, while UI components are separate, demonstrating a well-structured React application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved

    Translation functionality is preserved using react-i18next. The code includes the necessary imports, initialization, and usage of the `t` function for translating UI text throughout the application.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters

    The routing implementation with react-router-dom appears to maintain the expected URL structure
