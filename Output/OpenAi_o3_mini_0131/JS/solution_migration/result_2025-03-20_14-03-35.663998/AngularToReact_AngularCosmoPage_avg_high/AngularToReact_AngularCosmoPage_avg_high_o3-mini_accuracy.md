# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props  
  All code samples (interfaces for IPage and IUser, React.FC components, the custom hook useLocalStorage, etc.) demonstrate the use of TypeScript and proper type annotations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management  
  The provided code uses createSlice from Redux Toolkit in pageSlice.ts, and the store is properly configured using configureStore.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components  
  All components (e.g., PageForm, AppRoutes, App) are implemented as functional components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately  
  Hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useCallback are used in PageForm. Although useMemo is not explicitly used, the others are appropriately applied.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource  
  The API module (rest.ts) is implemented using axios, completely replacing Angular’s $resource.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components  
  The PageForm component demonstrates controlled components by managing field values via state and onChange handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation  
  The AppRoutes.tsx file provides a proper implementation of React Router v6 with BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization  
  The use of react‑i18next (via the useTranslation hook) and the i18n configuration in /src/i18n/config.ts confirms that internationalization is appropriately handled.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization  
  Code splitting is addressed by wrapping routes in a Suspense component in App.tsx, and dynamic import is mentioned. However, explicit usage of React.lazy for individual routes or components is not shown.  
  (Slightly less than 100% because while the Suspense fallback is used, explicit dynamic imports are not demonstrated.)

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations  
  Although the optimization section recommends using React.memo for reusable components, none of the provided components (for example, PageForm or the Button component) are wrapped with React.memo. This indicates the optimization is suggested but not implemented in the sample code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks  
  The useEffect and useCallback hooks correctly list their dependencies to avoid unnecessary re-renders and side effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models  
  The code defines TypeScript interfaces (IPage, IUser) for modeling data consistently across the project.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state  
  The PageForm component uses the useSelector hook (with RootState) to access Redux state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations  
  Action creators such as setPage, updateField, setNewerVersion, and resetLocalVersion are defined in pageSlice.ts and used appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks  
  The custom hook useLocalStorage.ts is implemented to encapsulate local storage read and write operations.
