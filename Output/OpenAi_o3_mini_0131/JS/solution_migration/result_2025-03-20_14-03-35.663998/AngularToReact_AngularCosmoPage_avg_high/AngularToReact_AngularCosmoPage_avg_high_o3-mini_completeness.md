# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
  While the code covers creating, updating, and deleting pages (via the API’s delete endpoint) and includes a duplicate flag in the async thunk, the deletion and duplication aspects are primarily handled at the API level with no UI-specific duplicate confirmation. This gives a high level of confidence, though minor details could be expanded.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
  The PageForm component includes a select element for the "type" field that allows users to choose a page type.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
  The component auto-generates a new URL in the handleChange callback when the title changes and the URL is empty or set to "new".

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
  Although the solution handles tags as a comma-separated input and converts them into an array, there is no implementation of autocomplete suggestions for tag management.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
  The form provides radio inputs for different publish states ("Y" for publish, "N" for draft, and "schedule" for scheduling).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
  When the "schedule" option is selected, a datetime-local input appears for selecting a publishing date.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
  The useLocalStorage hook is used along with logic to detect unsaved changes and allow restoration, indicating that local storage management is implemented.

- **Fail** (90%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
  The code uses simple alert calls to notify the user of errors (e.g., missing URL or type, save failure). While this meets basic notification requirements, it does not constitute a robust notification system. A more sophisticated approach (e.g., using a toast notification library) would be expected in modern applications.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
  The handleSubmit function checks for the presence of critical fields such as URL and page type before proceeding with the save operation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
  The provided API module defines endpoints for getting, saving, updating, deleting pages, managing tags, saving revisions, and deleting extras.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
  An API endpoint (deleteExtras) is defined to handle extras, and the IPage interface includes an extras field. However, dedicated UI handling for extras management is not demonstrated, so while the API support exists, the overall extras management functionality is only partially showcased.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
  Revision history is managed by calling pageAPI.saveRevision in both the create and update flows, ensuring that revision data is captured.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
  The suggested file structure clearly separates API calls, Redux slices, hooks, components, type definitions, and routes, promoting a clean separation of concerns.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
  The use of react‑i18next for internationalization is evident, and translation keys are used throughout the component, maintaining the original translation functionality from Angular’s $translate.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
  The routing setup using react-router-dom defines routes such as "/new" for new records and "/:url" to format dynamic URLs, preserving the expected URL structure.
