# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling
  
  The component clearly uses Angular's Reactive Forms approach. This is evident from the import of FormBuilder, FormGroup, Validators, and other form-related classes, as well as the implementation of the form using `this.fb.group()` in the ngOnInit method.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)

  The form validation properly implements synchronous validators:
  - Name: `[Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3), Validators.maxLength(60)]`
  - Email: `[Validators.required, Validators.email]`
  - Password: `[Validators.required, Validators.minLength(6)]`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use

  Asynchronous validation is correctly implemented for both name and email:
  - The `nameAsyncValidator()` method calls `this.authService.isName()`
  - The `emailAsyncValidator()` method calls `this.authService.isEmail()`
  - Both use timer(500) to debounce input and prevent excessive API calls

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched

  The HTML template shows proper validation styling:
  ```html
  [ngClass]="{'has-error': name.invalid && (name.dirty || name.touched), 'has-success': name.valid && (name.dirty || name.touched)}"
  ```
  This pattern is consistently applied to all form fields (name, email, password).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions

  The submission process is handled in the `onSubmit()` method, which:
  - Extracts form values
  - Dispatches the action: `this.store.dispatch(AuthActions.signupRequest({ name, email, password }))`
  - The API call itself is handled by the AuthEffects class via NgRx

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails

  Error messages are properly displayed using `*ngIf` directives:
  ```html
  <div *ngIf="name.invalid && (name.dirty || name.touched)" class="help-block">
    <div *ngIf="name.errors?.required">Name is required</div>
    <div *ngIf="name.errors?.minlength || name.errors?.maxlength">Name must be between 3 and 60 characters in length</div>
    <div *ngIf="name.errors?.nameTaken">{{ name.errors.nameTaken }}</div>
  </div>
  ```
  This pattern is consistently applied for all form fields.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service

  There is no evidence in the provided code that the Angular Title service is being used. The Title service should be imported from '@angular/platform-browser' and injected into the component constructor, then used to set the page title in ngOnInit.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management

  The code properly implements NgRx for state management:
  - Action creators are defined in auth.actions.ts
  - Effects are defined in auth.effects.ts
  - The store is injected and used in the component: `private store: Store<any>`
  - Actions are dispatched: `this.store.dispatch(AuthActions.signupRequest({ name, email, password }))`
  - The store is subscribed to: `this.store.select('auth').subscribe(...)`

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress

  The submit button properly uses the disabled property bound to the submitting state:
  ```html
  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary form-control" [disabled]="submitting">
  ```
  The submitting state is toggled in the onSubmit method.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both
