# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component includes all three required form fields: name, email, and password
  
  The component includes all three required form fields in both the component class and the HTML template. The form fields are properly defined in the `ngOnInit()` method using FormBuilder and have corresponding input elements in the HTML.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page includes a heading 'Join PodBaby today.'
  
  The HTML template includes an h2 element with the exact text "Join PodBaby today."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a lead paragraph about membership benefits
  
  The HTML includes a paragraph with class "lead" that explains: "As a member you can subscribe to podcast feeds and keep track of your favorite episodes."

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form includes a submit button with appropriate styling and icon
  
  The form includes a submit button with class "btn btn-primary form-control" and an icon using Font Awesome with class "fa fa-sign-in".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a link to the login page with appropriate text
  
  The page includes a link to the login page using the routerLink directive pointing to "/login" with the text "Already a member? Log in here."

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the FormGroup component or equivalent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display
  
  The component implements FormGroup correctly. Each form field has appropriate styling using ngClass to display success/error states, and error messages are shown conditionally using *ngIf directives based on validation state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Icon component or equivalent is implemented for the signup button
  
  The signup button includes an icon implemented using Font Awesome with the class "fa fa-sign-in".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all validation rules are implemented (name length, email format, password length)
  
  All required validations are implemented:
  - Name: required, minLength(3), maxLength(60)
  - Email: required, email format
  - Password: required, minLength(6)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure asynchronous validation for both name and email uniqueness is implemented
  
  Asynchronous validation is implemented for both name and email using AsyncValidatorFn. The implementation includes:
  - Debounce with timer(500)
  - API calls to check name/email availability
  - Proper error messages for taken names/emails

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API integration is complete with proper error handling
  
  The signup API integration is complete with:
  - Action dispatch to NgRx store
  - Error handling in the effects
  - Subscription to store state to handle success/failure cases
  - Routing to home page on success

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form layout matches the horizontal form structure specified
  
  The form layout uses Bootstrap classes for horizontal form structure with form-group classes and appropriate styling for input fields and error messages.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure the page has proper document title setting functionality
  
  There is no evidence in the provided code that the document title is being set. Angular applications typically set the document title using the Title service from @angular/platform-browser, but there is no import or usage of this service in the component. A proper implementation would include something like:
  ```typescript
  constructor(
    private titleService: Title,
    // other dependencies
  ) {}
  
  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.titleService.setTitle('Sign Up - PodBaby');
    // other initialization code
  }
  ```
