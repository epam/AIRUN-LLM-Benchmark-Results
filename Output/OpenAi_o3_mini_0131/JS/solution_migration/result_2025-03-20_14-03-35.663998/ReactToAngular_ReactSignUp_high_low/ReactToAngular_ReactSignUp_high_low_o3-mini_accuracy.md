# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The component imports FormBuilder, creates a FormGroup, and uses Reactive Forms APIs, confirming proper usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  Synchronous validators such as Validators.required, Validators.minLength, Validators.maxLength, and Validators.email are properly applied in the signup form configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  The component defines nameAsyncValidator and emailAsyncValidator, which use timer and switchMap to call AuthService methods for checking uniqueness.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The template uses ngClass directives to conditionally apply 'has-error' and 'has-success' classes based on the field’s validity and touch status, ensuring proper validation feedback.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  The onSubmit() method dispatches the signupRequest action with form values and subscribes to the store for state changes. The API service is indirectly called through the effect triggered by this action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The template includes conditional sections (using *ngIf) for each form control that display appropriate error messages when validation errors occur.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  There is no evidence in the provided code that the Angular Title service is used to set the page title, which is a missing implementation with respect to this step.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The component dispatches actions via the injected Store, and effects are properly set up in the provided AuthEffects file.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button in the template has the [disabled]="submitting" binding, and the component updates the 'submitting' state accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  In AuthEffects, the API call is managed through mergeMap, mapping successful responses to signupSuccess and handling errors with catchError mapping to signupFailure.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component properly implements OnInit for initialization and follows a modular approach consistent with Angular conventions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The AuthService uses HttpClient’s post and get methods, returning Observables instead of promises.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The template error messages for each form control correctly reflect requirements: for example, proper messages for required fields, length constraints, and uniqueness checks for name and email.
