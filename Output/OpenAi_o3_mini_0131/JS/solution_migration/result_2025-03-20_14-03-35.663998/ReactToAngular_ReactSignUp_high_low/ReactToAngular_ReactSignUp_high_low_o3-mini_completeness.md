# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component includes all three required form fields: name, email, and password  
  The SignupComponent uses FormBuilder to create a FormGroup with the controls “name”, “email”, and “password”.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page includes a heading 'Join PodBaby today.'  
  The HTML template contains the heading <code>&lt;h2&gt;Join PodBaby today.&lt;/h2&gt;</code>.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a lead paragraph about membership benefits  
  The provided HTML includes a <code>&lt;p class="lead"&gt;</code> element explaining membership benefits.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form includes a submit button with appropriate styling and icon  
  The form features a submit <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> with Bootstrap classes and an embedded icon (<code>&lt;i class="fa fa-sign-in"&gt;</code>).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a link to the login page with appropriate text  
  The HTML contains an anchor tag (<code>&lt;a routerLink="/login"&gt;</code>) with the text “Already a member? Log in here.”

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the FormGroup component or equivalent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display  
  The component defines a FormGroup with built-in validations and the HTML template conditionally applies classes for error display.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Icon component or equivalent is implemented for the signup button  
  The signup button includes a Font Awesome icon (<code>fa fa-sign-in</code>) which fulfills the icon requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all validation rules are implemented (name length, email format, password length)  
  The form controls include validators: “name” has required, minlength, and maxlength; “email” has required and email validators; “password” has required and a minimum length validator.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure asynchronous validation for both name and email uniqueness is implemented  
  The component defines <code>nameAsyncValidator</code> and <code>emailAsyncValidator</code> using RxJS timers and the respective AuthService methods for async validation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API integration is complete with proper error handling  
  The AuthService correctly implements API calls and the AuthEffects and SignupComponent both handle the API response and errors appropriately.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm the form layout matches the horizontal form structure specified  
  The provided code uses Bootstrap’s container and form-group classes but does not explicitly implement a horizontal form layout (typically involving a row with label and input columns). This may indicate the form layout does not meet a strict “horizontal” structure requirement.  
  Explanation: Without explicit row/column classes or labels aligned in a horizontal manner, it appears to be a vertical layout. There is a slight possibility that CSS elsewhere could achieve a horizontal style, but from the given code, it is not evident.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page has proper document title setting functionality  
  The code does not show any implementation for setting the document title (e.g., using Angular’s Title service or similar approach). This functionality is missing.
