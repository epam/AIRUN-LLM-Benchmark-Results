# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The solution clearly states it's using Angular 14 in the introduction and uses Angular-specific syntax, decorators, and imports throughout the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
  
  The solution includes proper NgRx store implementation with commands to install it (`ng add @ngrx/store@latest`), along with store configuration in the app.module.ts file and store usage throughout components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
  
  The solution properly implements @ngrx/effects with the TodoEffects class that handles localStorage persistence and loading of todos from storage.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
  
  The solution includes complete implementations of actions (todo.actions.ts), reducers (todo.reducer.ts), and selectors (todo.selectors.ts) following NgRx patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
  
  The components properly use @Component decorators and @Input properties where appropriate, like in the todo-item.component.ts file.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators
  
  The solution uses @ViewChild decorators in both TodoAppComponent (for the new todo input field) and TodoItemComponent (for the edit field), replacing React's refs.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
  
  The TodoItemComponent uses @Input() for receiving todo items, and the overall component structure shows proper parent-child communication.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
  
  The solution includes a TodoService that handles persistence logic and utility functions like UUID generation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
  
  Dependency injection is implemented correctly in services and components, with `@Injectable()` decorators and proper constructor injection.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
  
  The solution doesn't explicitly specify change detection strategies using `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` where it could be beneficial, such as in the TodoItemComponent or TodoFooterComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
  
  The solution implements Angular Router with an AppRoutingModule and proper route configurations for different todo filters.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code structure, naming conventions, and organization follow Angular style guide recommendations.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
  
  The solution defines and uses proper TypeScript interfaces for Todo, Filter, and AppState, and uses strong typing throughout components and services.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
  
  The solution includes proper Angular HTML templates for all components with appropriate Angular-specific syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
  
  The solution replaces React event handlers with Angular's event binding syntax like (click), (change), (keydown), etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs
  
  The solution states that "All TODOs have been resolved" and there are no TODO comments visible in the code.

- **Fail** (80%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules
  
  While the solution mentions that "Lazy loading could be implemented by moving the todo feature into its own module if the app grows," it doesn't actually implement lazy loading. The code presents a standard eager loading approach.
