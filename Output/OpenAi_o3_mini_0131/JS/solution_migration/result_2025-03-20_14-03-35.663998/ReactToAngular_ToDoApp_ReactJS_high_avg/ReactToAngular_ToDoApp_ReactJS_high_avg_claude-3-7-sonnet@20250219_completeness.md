# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items
  
  The solution implements a component structure that properly displays todo items. It uses NgRx selectors to retrieve todos and renders them in the TodoAppComponent through the todo-list element with proper binding.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented
  
  The solution includes functionality to add new todo items through the handleNewTodo method in TodoAppComponent, which dispatches the addTodo action when Enter is pressed in the input field.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works
  
  Toggling functionality is implemented in the TodoItemComponent with the onToggle method that dispatches the toggleTodo action, and the reducer correctly updates the completed status.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented
  
  Editing functionality is implemented with the onEdit method in TodoItemComponent, which allows users to enter edit mode, and the onSave method which saves the edited text when completed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented
  
  The solution provides deletion functionality through the onDestroy method in the TodoItemComponent, which dispatches the destroyTodo action when the destroy button is clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented
  
  The toggleAll method in TodoAppComponent dispatches the toggleAll action which marks all todos as complete or incomplete, with the reducer correctly handling this state change.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works
  
  Filtering is implemented through the Angular Router and NgRx. The router configuration includes routes for '/', '/active', and '/completed', and the selectVisibleTodos selector filters todos based on the current filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The TodoFooterComponent displays the active count through the activeCount$ observable, which is retrieved using the selectActiveCount selector.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items
  
  The clearCompleted method in TodoFooterComponent dispatches the clearCompleted action, which is handled by the reducer to remove all completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage
  
  The solution uses NgRx Effects to handle persistence. The persistTodos$ effect listens for actions that modify todos and saves them to localStorage using the TodoService.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation
  
  The application uses Angular Router with routes configured for '/', '/active', and '/completed', maintaining the same URL structure as the original application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states
  
  The main section in TodoAppComponent uses *ngIf="(visibleTodos$ | async)?.length as count" to conditionally render the todo list only when there are items, handling empty states appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly
  
  Form submissions are handled correctly through event handling for key presses (Enter to submit, Escape to cancel) in both adding new todos and editing existing ones.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships
  
  The solution follows Angular best practices with a clear component hierarchy: TodoAppComponent as the main container, TodoItemComponent for individual items, and TodoFooterComponent for the footer.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved
  
  All business logic from the original application is preserved and implemented in the NgRx architecture, with actions, reducers, selectors, and effects handling state management while maintaining the same functionality.
