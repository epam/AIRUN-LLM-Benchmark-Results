# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The App Component template iterates over (visibleTodos$ | async) using *ngFor with an <app-todo-item> for each todo. This confirms that all todos are displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoAppComponent includes a handleNewTodo method that dispatches the addTodo action when the Enter key is pressed, successfully adding new items.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  The TodoItemComponent provides an onToggle method that dispatches the toggleTodo action and the reducer updates the completed state accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent implements onEdit, onSave, and onCancel methods that allow for editing a todo, with the editing state maintained and handled via NgRx actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent includes an onDestroy method that dispatches the destroyTodo action to delete a todo item; the reducer then updates the state accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  In the TodoAppComponent, the toggleAll method dispatches toggleAll with the completed state based on the checkbox, and the reducer maps over todos to update their completed status.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  The selectors (selectVisibleTodos) and the router configuration to dispatch setFilter action based on the URL demonstrate proper filtering behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooterComponent subscribes to selectActiveCount and outputs the count inside the footer, confirming that active items are displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The footer includes a clearCompleted button wired to dispatch the clearCompleted action, and the reducer removes completed todos accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  The TodoEffects persistTodos$ listens to todo-related actions and updates localStorage using TodoService.store, while loadTodos$ dispatches loadedTodos from localStorage, confirming persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  Angular Router is configured with child routes for '', 'active', and 'completed', using hash routing. URL changes trigger filter updates, ensuring navigation consistency.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  The main section is rendered conditionally via *ngIf based on the length of visibleTodos. While no explicit “empty state” message is shown, hiding the main list and displaying the footer with 0 active count is acceptable in many TodoMVC implementations. (Slightly less than 100% since preference for an explicit “empty state” message can be subjective.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  The new todo is added on the Enter key in the input field and the event is properly prevented from default behavior, ensuring correct form submission handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The application cleanly separates concerns into App Component, Todo Item Component, and Todo Footer Component, with each component interacting via inputs and NgRx store, confirming proper component structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  All key functionalities (adding, toggling, editing, deleting, filtering, and persistence) are present and managed by NgRx state, thereby preserving the original application’s business logic.
