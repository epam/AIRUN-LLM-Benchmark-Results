# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The solution consistently references Angular 14 throughout the code structure and implementation patterns. The module structure, component architecture, and use of modern Angular features confirm Angular 14.x is being used.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS
  
  All code samples use ES module imports (`import` statements) instead of RequireJS, with proper module declarations throughout.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management
  
  The solution implements @ngrx/store with proper imports from '@ngrx/store', Store injection in components, and state management through the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects
  
  @ngrx/effects is properly implemented with the TodoEffects class decorated with @Injectable and using createEffect() for side effects related to persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management
  
  The solution includes comprehensive actions (loadTodos, addTodo, updateTodo, removeTodo, clearCompleted, toggleAll), a reducer with all necessary state transitions, selectors for various aspects of the state, and effects for persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator
  
  The TodoStorageService is properly decorated with @Injectable and provides providedIn: 'root' configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service
  
  The TodoStorageService correctly implements localStorage access with getTodos() and saveTodos() methods using the appropriate localStorage API.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators
  
  All components (AppComponent, TodoInputComponent, TodoListComponent, TodoItemComponent, TodoFooterComponent) are properly decorated with @Component and include appropriate selector and template properties.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators
  
  Both TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective use the @Directive decorator with correct selector configurations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)
  
  Templates correctly use Angular structural directives such as *ngFor (for iterating todos) and *ngIf (for conditional rendering).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))
  
  Event bindings use the correct Angular syntax with parentheses, such as (click), (change), (ngSubmit), etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])
  
  Property bindings correctly use square brackets syntax for [checked], [class.selected], etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed
  
  The TodoFocusDirective properly implements ngOnChanges lifecycle hook to handle focus behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models
  
  The Todo model is defined as a TypeScript interface with appropriate properties (id, title, completed).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services
  
  Dependency injection is correctly implemented with constructor parameters (private store: Store) in components and services.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code generally follows Angular style guide conventions with proper naming, organization, and architecture. The slight reduction in confidence is due to some minor inconsistencies in file paths mentioned in the imports versus the file structure description, but these appear to be formatting issues rather than fundamental style issues.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings
  
  While there's no explicit indication of console errors or warnings, the implementation appears sound. The reduced confidence is because we can't actually run the code to verify no runtime errors exist, but the code structure suggests it should run without errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)
  
  The code makes good use of Type
