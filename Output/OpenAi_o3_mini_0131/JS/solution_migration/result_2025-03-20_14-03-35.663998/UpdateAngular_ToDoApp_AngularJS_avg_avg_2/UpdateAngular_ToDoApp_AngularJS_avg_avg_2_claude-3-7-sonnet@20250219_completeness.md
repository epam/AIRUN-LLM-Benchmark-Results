- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo
- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original

    The code seems to maintain the TodoMVC visual appearance through CSS class usage (like `todoapp`, `header`, `main`, `footer`, etc.), but without seeing the actual CSS files or a direct comparison with the original, I cannot be 100% confident that all visual aspects are maintained.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately
- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter

    The code implements filtering functionality in the TodoFooterComponent by setting a local template state for the filter (All, Active, Completed), but it doesn't update the URL based on the selected filter. The code comment "(You can improve filter functionality further by dispatching a filter action or using route params.)" acknowledges that URL updates with route parameters would be an improvement but isn't implemented in the current solution.
