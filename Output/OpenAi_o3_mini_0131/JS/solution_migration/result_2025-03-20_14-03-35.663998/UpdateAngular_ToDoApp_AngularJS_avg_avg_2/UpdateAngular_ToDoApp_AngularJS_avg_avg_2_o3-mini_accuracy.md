# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The provided migration instructions and code explicitly mention Angular 14.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
  The sample code imports modules using ES module syntax (e.g., import { NgModule } from '@angular/core') and explicitly states that RequireJS is no longer used.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
  The application configures NgRx Store using StoreModule.forRoot with a todoReducer, and actions along with reducers are properly defined.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
  NgRx Effects are set up via EffectsModule.forRoot with TodoEffects, and an effect is shown for persisting todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
  The provided code includes a complete set of actions (addTodo, updateTodo, etc.), a reducer, selectors for data retrieval, and an effect for handling persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
  For example, TodoStorageService is decorated with @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
  The TodoStorageService uses localStorage.getItem and localStorage.setItem to persist and retrieve todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
  All components, such as AppComponent, TodoInputComponent, and TodoListComponent, are correctly decorated with @Component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
  Both TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective are implemented using the @Directive decorator with appropriate selectors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
  The templates include Angular structural directives like *ngFor and *ngIf to handle lists and conditional rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
  The code demonstrates event binding with proper usage, for example (click)="removeTodo()" in component templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
  Property binding is evident in the templates (for instance, [checked]="todo.completed" and [class.selected]="currentFilter === 'all'"). 

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
  The TodoFocusDirective implements ngOnChanges appropriately. Components that do not require lifecycle hooks do not implement them unnecessarily.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
  The Todo model is defined as a TypeScript interface in todo.model.ts.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
  The code uses constructor injection (for Store, ElementRef, etc.) consistently throughout the application.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The provided sample generally adheres to Angular style guidelines in terms of project structure and naming conventions.  
  Explanation: Although the structure and naming generally follow best practices, there might be minor stylistic variations or improvements possible (for instance, additional file organization or further strict typing in some templates) that prevent a full 100%.

- **Pass** (70%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
  Based on the code quality and usage of Angular best practices, it is expected that no console errors or warnings would occur.  
  Explanation: Without executing the application, a 100% confidence rating is not possible; however, the sample appears to be error-free in its static analysis.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
  The use of TypeScript features such as interfaces, type annotations in function parameters, and module imports is consistent.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
  The code sample is free from any leftover TODO comments or large blocks of commented-out code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design  
  Each component, service, and directive has a focused purpose (e.g., TodoInputComponent for input, TodoListComponent for listing todos, etc.) demonstrating adherence to the single responsibility principle.
