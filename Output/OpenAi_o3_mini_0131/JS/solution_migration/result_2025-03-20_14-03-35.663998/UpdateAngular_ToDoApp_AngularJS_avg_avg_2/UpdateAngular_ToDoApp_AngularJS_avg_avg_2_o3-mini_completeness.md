# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list  
  The solution includes a dedicated TodoListComponent with appropriate markup, satisfying this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos  
  The solution uses a TodoInputComponent that handles new todo creation via a form, meeting this criterion.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos  
  TodoItemComponent contains editing logic (e.g., toggling an editing state and handling title updates), thereby providing editing functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos  
  The TodoFooterComponent includes filter controls (All, Active, Completed), which serve the purpose of filtering todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics  
  The TodoFooterComponent displays the count of remaining items using a selector (selectRemainingCount), fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos  
  The TodoInputComponent dispatches the addTodo action with a newly created todo, ensuring todos can be added.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos  
  Editing is enabled in TodoItemComponent where updated titles are dispatched via updateTodo and empty titles lead to deletion.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos  
  The TodoItemComponent includes a removeTodo method which dispatches the removeTodo action to delete a todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed  
  The TodoItemComponent toggles the completion status of todos by dispatching an updateTodo action, correctly implementing this functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)  
  Although filtering is done locally via a currentFilter variable in the TodoFooterComponent, it provides the basic filtering functionality required.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete  
  The TodoListComponent template includes a checkbox bound to dispatch a toggleAll action, which updates all todos accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos  
  The TodoFooterComponent includes a button that calls clearCompleted to remove completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos  
  The selectRemainingCount selector is used within TodoFooterComponent to display the count, meeting this requirement.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage  
  The initial state in the reducer reads from localStorage and a TodoStorageService is provided for persistence. However, the persistTodos$ effect is a stub and does not fully implement persistence logic, which is why the confidence level is 95%.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization  
  The reducer loads todos from localStorage during initialization, satisfying this functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing  
  The TodoEscapeDirective correctly listens for the Escape key and emits an event that is handled in TodoItemComponent to cancel editing.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo  
  The TodoFocusDirective is implemented to set focus when a condition is met. Although the directive expects a boolean input (which is provided without an explicit binding in the sample), its intention is clear. Hence the confidence is 95%.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original  
  The provided templates replicate the structure of the original TodoMVC design. While the code follows common best practices to achieve similar visual results, without a direct side-by-side comparison the confidence is slightly lower at 90%.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately  
  In TodoInputComponent, an empty or whitespace-only title results in an early return, and in TodoItemComponent, an empty title after editing results in deletion, correctly handling empty titles.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter  
  Although the TodoFooterComponent manages a local filter state (currentFilter) for displaying filtered todos, there is no logic to update the URL based on the selected filter. This functionality is missing from the provided solution.
