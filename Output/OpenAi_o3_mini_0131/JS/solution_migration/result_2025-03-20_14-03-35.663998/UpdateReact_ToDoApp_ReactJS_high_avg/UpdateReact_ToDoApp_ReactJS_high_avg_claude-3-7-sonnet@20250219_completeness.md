# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed
  
  The code in `TodoApp.tsx` clearly implements this functionality in the `handleNewTodoKeyDown` function, which checks for the Enter key, trims the input, dispatches the `addTodo` action, and clears the input field.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter
  
  The code in `TodoApp.tsx` filters todos based on the `nowShowing` state value and renders only the filtered todos. It correctly handles "all", "active", and "completed" filter states.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos
  
  The `handleToggleAll` function in `TodoApp.tsx` dispatches the `toggleAll` action which marks all todos as completed or active. The reducer in `todosSlice.ts` implements this functionality properly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted
  
  The `TodoItem.tsx` component implements handlers for toggling (`handleToggle`), editing (`handleEdit`), and deleting (`handleDestroy`) todos, dispatching the appropriate actions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode
  
  In `TodoItem.tsx`, the label element has an `onDoubleClick={handleEdit}` event handler that dispatches the `setEditing` action to enable editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo
  
  In `TodoItem.tsx`, the `handleKeyDown` function checks for the Enter key and calls `handleSubmit` which saves the edited todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value
  
  The `handleKeyDown` function in `TodoItem.tsx` also checks for the Escape key, resets the edit text to the original todo title, and exits editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The `TodoFooter.tsx` component receives a `count` prop representing active items and displays it along with properly pluralized text.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The `TodoFooter.tsx` component includes filter links for "All", "Active", and "Completed", with appropriate URL hash changes and styling for the selected filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos
  
  The `TodoFooter.tsx` component includes a "Clear completed" button that dispatches the `clearCompleted` action when clicked, and is only shown when there are completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence
  
  The application loads todos from localStorage in the initial state setup in `todosSlice.ts` and subscribes to store changes in `index.tsx` to save todos to localStorage whenever state changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state
  
  The application conditionally renders various UI elements based on state, such as the main section when there are todos, the footer when there are active or completed todos, and the edit input field when editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count
  
  The application uses a `pluralize` utility function in `utils.ts` that is correctly used in the footer to display "item" or "items" based on count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components
  
  The code is well-structured with separate components for the main app (`TodoApp.tsx`), individual todo items (`TodoItem.tsx`), and the footer (`TodoFooter.tsx`), each with focused responsibilities.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality
  
  The code follows a clear organization pattern with separate directories for features (`features/todos`), components, and utilities, and separates the Redux store configuration into its own file.
