# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The TodoApp component’s input field has an onKeyDown handler that listens for the 'Enter' key. When pressed, if the trimmed input is not empty, it dispatches the addTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The TodoApp component filters the todos based on the nowShowing state (which is updated via the URL hash) and maps over the filteredTodos to display them in a list.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  A checkbox with id "toggle-all" in the TodoApp triggers the toggleAll action via its onChange handler, allowing all todos’ completion status to be toggled.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  In the TodoItem component, functionality is provided through event handlers: clicking the checkbox toggles, double-clicking initiates editing, and clicking the destroy button deletes the todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  The label element in TodoItem has an onDoubleClick event that triggers the edit mode by dispatching setEditing, which correctly places the component in editing state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  Inside TodoItem, the onKeyDown handler listens for the 'Enter' key to invoke handleSubmit, which either saves the updated title or deletes the todo if the new text is empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  The onKeyDown handler in TodoItem also captures the 'Escape' key. When pressed, it resets the edit text to the original todo.title and cancels the editing state by dispatching setEditing(null).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooter component displays the count of active items (items not completed) using the provided count prop.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The TodoFooter component presents three links corresponding to the filters "All", "Active", and "Completed". Clicking these links updates the URL hash, which in turn alters the state filter via the TodoApp useEffect.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  The TodoFooter displays a "Clear completed" button when completedCount is greater than zero, which dispatches the clearCompleted action on click.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  In index.tsx, a store.subscribe callback persists the todos slice to localStorage on each state change, and the todosSlice initializes its state by reading from localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  The TodoApp component conditionally renders the main section (only if todos exist) and the TodoFooter (if active or completed todos exist), demonstrating correct conditional UI behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  The TodoFooter uses a pluralize utility function from utils.ts to correctly pluralize the word "item" based on the provided count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The application is divided among focused components such as TodoApp, TodoItem, and TodoFooter. Each component handles a distinct responsibility, demonstrating clear component separation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The file structure separates concerns into folders like "features" (for todosSlice), "components" (for UI components), and "utils", illustrating an organized structure by functionality.
