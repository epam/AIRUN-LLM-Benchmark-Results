# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration
  
  The code explicitly mentions using React 18 with Create React App using TypeScript template. The instruction "npx create-react-app virtual-piano --template typescript" is provided, and the code uses TypeScript syntax throughout with .tsx file extensions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure
  
  TypeScript interfaces are properly utilized, including:
  - `Note` type definition as a union type for all piano notes
  - `Record<Note, HTMLAudioElement>` typing for the sound mapper
  - `KeyData` interface for piano key properties
  - `PianoProps` and `PianoKeyProps` interfaces for component props

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks
  
  All components (App, Piano, PianoKey) are implemented as functional components with the React.FC type annotation. The code utilizes various React hooks such as useState, useCallback, and useEffect.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)
  
  The application properly uses:
  - `useState` for managing UI state (isLettersMode, activeNotes)
  - `useEffect` for handling keyboard events with proper cleanup
  - `useCallback` for memoizing event handler functions

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels
  
  Keyboard event handlers are implemented at the App component level using useEffect, which is appropriate since these are global events. The handlers properly map keyboard keys to notes and update the state accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events
  
  The PianoKey component correctly implements all required mouse interactions using React's synthetic events:
  - onMouseDown for key press
  - onMouseUp for key release
  - onMouseOut for leaving a pressed key
  - onMouseEnter with button check for dragging (mousemove equivalent)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment
  
  Audio resources are handled correctly with:
  - Audio objects created using process.env.PUBLIC_URL for correct path resolution
  - Proper sound playback logic with currentTime reset
  - Appropriate handling in the component lifecycle

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility
  
  Fullscreen functionality is implemented with:
  - A React event handler (handleFullscreenToggle)
  - Proper use of the browser's fullscreen API
  - Error handling for browser compatibility
  - Toggle behavior between fullscreen and normal mode

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns
  
  Conditional class application follows React patterns:
  - Using template strings and ternary operators for dynamic class names
  - Building class lists programmatically and joining them
  - Applying active state classes based on component props

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate
  
  Performance optimization is correctly implemented:
  - React.memo is used on the PianoKey component to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - useCallback is used for event handlers to maintain referential equality
  - Event handlers include proper dependency arrays

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations
  
  The audio playback is handled correctly regarding React's lifecycle:
  - Audio objects are created outside of the component render cycle
  - Sound playback is triggered by stateful events
  - The code resets currentTime before playing to ensure consistent behavior

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application
  
  The code consistently uses TypeScript typing throughout:
  - Explicit type annotations for all state variables
  - Proper interface definitions for all component props
  - Type definitions for keyboard event handlers
  - Union types for the Note type
