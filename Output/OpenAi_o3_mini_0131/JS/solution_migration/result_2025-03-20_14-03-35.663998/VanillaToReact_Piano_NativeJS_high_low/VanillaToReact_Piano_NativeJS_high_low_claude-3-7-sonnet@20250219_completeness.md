# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'
  
  The code includes a header component with the class "header" that contains an h1 element with the class "header-title" displaying "Virtual Piano".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons
  
  The application includes a div with class "btn-container" that contains two buttons: one with the text "Notes" and one with the text "Letters". These buttons have the appropriate classes and onClick handlers to toggle between the two modes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)
  
  The Piano component correctly renders both white keys (natural notes) and sharp keys. The white keys are rendered directly in the piano component, and the sharp keys are rendered inside a "keys-sharp" div. The code includes all the expected piano keys, including a placeholder for the missing sharp key.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes
  
  Each piano key div has data attributes for both letter and note:
  ```jsx
  <div
    className={classNames.join(' ')}
    data-letter={letter}
    data-note={note}
    // ...event handlers
  >
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked
  
  The application includes a soundMapper object that maps each note to its corresponding audio file. When a piano key is clicked (via the handleMouseDown event), the playNote function is called, which correctly updates the activeNotes state and plays the sound using the HTML Audio API.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)
  
  The PianoKey component adds the "piano-key-active" class to keys that are active, based on the isActive prop which is derived from the activeNotes state in the App component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes
  
  The App component includes a useEffect hook that adds event listeners for 'keydown' and 'keyup' events. These event handlers map keyboard keys to piano notes and call playNote and resetNote appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked
  
  The App component includes a state variable isLettersMode and a handleModeChange function that updates this state. The state is passed to the Piano component, which in turn passes it to each PianoKey. When in letters mode, the piano keys display their corresponding letter.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes
  
  The application includes a button with class "fullscreen" and an onClick handler that calls handleFullscreenToggle. This function correctly implements the Fullscreen API, toggling between fullscreen and normal modes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly
  
  The activeNotes state is an array that can hold multiple notes, and the playNote function is designed to add a note to this array only if it's not already present. This ensures that multiple keys can be active at the same time.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys
  
  The PianoKey component includes a handleMouseEnter function that checks for the buttons property to determine if the mouse button is pressed during the enter event. This allows for dragging across keys to play them in sequence.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information
  
  The App component includes a footer element with the class "footer" containing a div with the class "footer-container" displaying the year "2020".
