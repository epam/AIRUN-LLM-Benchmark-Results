# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration  
  The answer clearly indicates that the project was created with "npx create-react-app virtual-piano --template typescript" and all code is using React 18 conventions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure  
  The audio mapping is declared as a constant using TypeScript’s Record type (Record<Note, HTMLAudioElement>), and the code also defines interfaces for key data; this meets strict TypeScript typing expectations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks  
  All components (App, Piano, PianoKey) are implemented as functional components. React hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useCallback are utilized appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)  
  The useState hook manages state for note toggling and letter/notes mode, and useEffect is used for handling global events, demonstrating proper state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels  
  The keyboard event handlers are set up in the App component using the useEffect hook on the window object. These handlers correctly convert key presses to notes and are removed on cleanup.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events  
  The PianoKey component implements onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseOut, and onMouseEnter via React’s synthetic events with useCallback to ensure event handling efficiency.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment  
  Audio playback is managed by a soundMapper constant defined outside the components, utilizing process.env.PUBLIC_URL to correctly reference assets, which is proper for React.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure full-screen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility  
  The fullscreen feature is implemented as an event handler in the App component that uses document.fullscreenElement and requestFullscreen, along with error handling via .catch. This approach is consistent with React patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns  
  Conditional classes are applied in both the App and Piano components using template literals and JavaScript conditions, which is in line with best React practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate  
  The PianoKey component is wrapped with React.memo to avoid unnecessary re-renders, showing conscious use of performance optimization techniques.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations  
  Audio playback is triggered via callbacks with proper resetting of playback time. Although the useEffect for keyboard events reattaches listeners upon dependency changes, the cleanup is correctly implemented, ensuring there are no lifecycle issues.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application  
  The application leverages TypeScript effectively with explicit type annotations, union types, and interfaces, ensuring strict type safety across components and functionalities.
