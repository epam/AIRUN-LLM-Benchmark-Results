# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'  
  The App.tsx file clearly defines a header with an h1 element containing "Virtual Piano".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons  
  The code includes a div with the class "btn-container" and two buttons that toggle between notes and letters.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)  
  The Piano component maps over arrays for whiteKeys (7 keys) and sharpKeys (6 keys, including a placeholder), rendering them appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes  
  The PianoKey component applies data-letter and data-note attributes based on the provided keyData, ensuring the necessary metadata is present.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked  
  The playNote function in App.tsx resets and plays the correct audio from the soundMapper mapping upon key activation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)  
  Active keys are determined by checking if a note is in the activeNotes state and the PianoKey component adds the class "piano-key-active" accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes  
  Global keyboard event listeners are established using useEffect, mapping keys to notes and triggering playNote/resetNote functions appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked  
  The isLettersMode state is toggled by the respective buttons, and the Piano component adapts its rendering based on the mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes  
  The fullscreen toggle function utilizes the browser’s fullscreen API and is successfully bound to a button click event.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly  
  The activeNotes state is updated using an array that adds a note only if it isn’t already active, supporting the concept of multiple keys being active simultaneously.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys  
  The PianoKey component includes an onMouseEnter event that checks if the mouse button is pressed (e.buttons === 1) to trigger a note, which supports dragging.  
  (Slight uncertainty stems from nuances in different browser event implementations, though the implementation follows best practices.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information  
  A footer element displaying "2020" is present in App.tsx as part of the application layout.
