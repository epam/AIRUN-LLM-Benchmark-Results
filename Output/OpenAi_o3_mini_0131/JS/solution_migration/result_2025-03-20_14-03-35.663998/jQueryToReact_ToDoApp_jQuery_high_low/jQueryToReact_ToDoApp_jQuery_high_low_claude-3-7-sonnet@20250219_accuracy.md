# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18.x
  
  The code explicitly imports from 'react-dom/client' and uses `ReactDOM.createRoot()` which is a React 18.x feature. In index.tsx, we can see:
  ```typescript
  import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript for type safety
  
  All files have .tsx or .ts extensions and contain TypeScript-specific syntax such as interface definitions, type annotations, and generics. For example:
  ```typescript
  interface TodoItemProps {
    todo: Todo;
  }
  
  const TodoItem: React.FC<TodoItemProps> = ({ todo }) => { ... }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for state management
  
  The code clearly uses Redux Toolkit's createSlice for state management in todosSlice.ts:
  ```typescript
  import { createSlice, PayloadAction } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
  
  const todosSlice = createSlice({
    name: 'todos',
    initialState,
    reducers: { ... }
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm nanoid is used for generating unique IDs
  
  The code imports and uses nanoid to generate unique IDs in the prepare callback of the addTodo reducer:
  ```typescript
  import { nanoid } from 'nanoid';
  
  prepare(title: string) {
    return { payload: { id: nanoid(), title, completed: false } };
  }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code uses functional components with hooks instead of class components
  
  All components are defined as functional components using the React.FC type and utilize React hooks like useState, useDispatch, and useSelector. For example:
  ```typescript
  const TodoInput: React.FC = () => {
    const [title, setTitle] = useState('');
    const dispatch = useDispatch<AppDispatch>();
    // ...
  }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains the same routing functionality with proper route handling
  
  The application uses react-router-dom with HashRouter to maintain the original routing behavior:
  ```typescript
  import { HashRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
  
  // In index.tsx
  <HashRouter>
    <App />
  </HashRouter>
  
  // In App.tsx
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<Navigate to="/all" replace />} />
    <Route path="/:filter" element={<FilterWrapper />} />
  </Routes>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Redux store is properly configured with appropriate slices
  
  The store.ts file properly configures the Redux store with todosReducer:
  ```typescript
  export const store = configureStore({
    reducer: {
      todos: todosReducer
    }
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the Redux provider is set up in the application entry point
  
  The Redux Provider is properly set up in index.tsx:
  ```typescript
  <Provider store={store}>
    <HashRouter>
      <App />
    </HashRouter>
  </Provider>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for all data structures
  
  The code defines appropriate TypeScript interfaces for data structures, including the Todo interface and state types:
  ```typescript
  // src/types/Todo.ts
  export interface Todo {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    completed: boolean;
  }
  
  // In store.ts
  export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>;
  export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch;
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows React best practices for component composition
  
  The code follows React best practices by breaking the application into small, focused components with clear responsibilities. The TodoApp component composes TodoInput, TodoList,
