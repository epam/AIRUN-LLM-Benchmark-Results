# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos  
  The header section in TodoApp.tsx contains an <h1> with “todos” and the TodoInput component, which provides an input field for new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos  
  The main section, implemented in TodoApp.tsx and TodoList.tsx, contains a toggle-all checkbox (rendered conditionally when todos exist) and an unordered list of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button  
  In TodoItem.tsx, every todo is rendered with a checkbox (for toggling completion), a label for the title, and a delete button (with the class “destroy”).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode  
  The label in TodoItem.tsx has an onDoubleClick event handler that switches the component into editing mode by updating the local editing state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The App.tsx uses react-router-dom with dynamic parameters, and the FilterWrapper passes a valid filter to the TodoApp. Both TodoList and TodoFooter handle filtering based on the provided filter prop.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization  
  In TodoFooter.tsx, the count of active (not completed) todos is shown, and a simple pluralization function correctly handles the plurality of the word “item.”

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter  
  The footer renders filter links using react-router-dom’s Link component and assigns the “selected” class to the link representing the current filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist  
  The TodoFooter component conditionally renders a “Clear completed” button if there are any completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter  
  In TodoInput.tsx, an onKeyUp event handler checks for the “Enter” key. It dispatches the addTodo action when the entered text is non-empty, allowing new todos to be created.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos  
  Each TodoItem includes a checkbox that triggers the toggleTodo action via its onChange event handler, allowing individual todos to have their completion status toggled.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once  
  The TodoList component includes a toggle-all checkbox which dispatches the toggleAll action, enabling all todos to be marked as complete or active simultaneously.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management  
  When activated (by double-clicking), TodoItem switches to an edit mode that auto-focuses the input field and handles key events (Enter to finish, Escape to cancel) along with the onBlur event to complete the editing.  
  (Note: Although the focus management is basic, it meets the common requirements for a TodoMVC app.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos  
  The delete functionality is implemented in TodoItem.tsx with a delete button that dispatches the deleteTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos  
  The Clear completed button in the TodoFooter component dispatches the clearCompleted action, effectively removing all completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status  
  The TodoList component correctly applies filters (“all”, “active”, “completed”) to display only the todos matching the current filter criteria.
