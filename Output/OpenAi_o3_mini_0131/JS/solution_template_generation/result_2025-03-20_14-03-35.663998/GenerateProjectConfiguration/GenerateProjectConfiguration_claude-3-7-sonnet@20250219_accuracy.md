- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the React setup includes necessary entry points and proper component structure
  
  The project includes a proper React entry point in `src/index.tsx` that correctly mounts the application to the DOM. The component structure follows best practices with App as the main component and separation of concerns in pages and routing.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that Redux is implemented with appropriate store configuration, reducers, and actions
  
  Redux is properly implemented using Redux Toolkit with a store configuration in `src/store/index.ts`, and a slice in `counterSlice.ts` that includes actions and a reducer. The store is provided to the React application in the entry point.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify React Router is correctly configured with defined routes and navigation components
  
  React Router is properly configured in `AppRouter.tsx` with Routes and Route components. Navigation links are implemented in the page components using the Link component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure testing libraries are properly configured with appropriate test setup files
  
  Testing is configured with Vitest, Jest DOM, and React Testing Library in the `package.json`. The `vite.config.ts` file includes test configuration with the JSDOM environment.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate package.json includes correct dependencies with compatible version specifications
  
  The `package.json` file includes all necessary dependencies with appropriate version specifications, including React, Redux, Router, TypeScript, and testing libraries.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm package.json contains scripts for development, building, and testing operations

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the project structure follows modern React development conventions
  
  The project structure follows modern React conventions with separate directories for pages, routing, and state management. Components are modular and follow a logical organization.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that configuration files are production-ready with appropriate optimization settings
  
  Configuration files are set up for production use with appropriate settings in `vite.config.ts` and TypeScript configuration files. The build script in `package.json` will create optimized production builds.
