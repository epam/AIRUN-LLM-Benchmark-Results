# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that the tests are isolated and do not depend on each other.
**Pass**: Each test case is independent, using `beforeEach` and `afterEach` to set up and tear down the environment.

### Step 2: Validate that the tests adhere to best practices for unit testing.
**Pass**: The tests are well-structured, focusing on individual components and their behavior. They use mocking to isolate the unit under test.

### Step 3: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
**Pass**: The code does not contain any noticeable duplications and adheres to the DRY principle.

### Step 4: Verify that the testing environment is set up correctly.
**Pass**: The `setupTests.js` file configures Enzyme with the appropriate adapter, and the `package.json` includes necessary configurations for Jest.

### Step 5: Check if a testing library for JavaScript (such as Jest) has been chosen.
**Pass**: Jest is chosen as the testing library, as indicated in the `package.json` and the test files.

### Step 6: Validate that dependencies are mocked where necessary, such as API calls.
**Pass**: API calls and other dependencies are mocked appropriately using `jest.mock`.

### Step 7: Verify that the test coverage for the code is at least 80%.
**Fail**: The provided information does not include test coverage reports, so this cannot be verified.

### Step 8: Confirm that the package.json file includes necessary dependencies and scripts for running tests.
**Pass**: The `package.json` file includes necessary dependencies and a script for running tests with Jest.

### Step 9: Confirm that the tests use the proper methods and assertions from the chosen testing library.
**Pass**: The tests use appropriate methods and assertions from Jest and Enzyme.
