# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Confirm that unit tests are written for the signup.js file.
**Pass** - Unit tests are written for the `Signup` component in the `__tests__/Signup.test.js` file.

### Step 2: Ensure that unit tests are written for the form.js file.
**Pass** - Unit tests are written for the `FormGroup` component in the `__tests__/FormGroup.test.js` file.

### Step 3: Ensure that the tests cover form field validation for the Signup component.
**Fail** - The tests do not explicitly cover form field validation for the `Signup` component. They check for form submission and rendering but not for individual field validation.

### Step 4: Verify that the tests cover form submission with valid data for the Signup component.
**Pass** - The test `submits form successfully and dispatches action` in `__tests__/Signup.test.js` covers form submission with valid data.

### Step 5: Ensure that the tests include scenarios for handling async validation errors in the Signup component.
**Pass** - The test `handles submission error correctly` in `__tests__/Signup.test.js` covers handling async validation errors.

### Step 6: Confirm that the FormGroup component is tested for rendering children and displaying error messages.
**Pass** - The test `renders children correctly` and `applies bsStyle "error" when field is touched and has an error` in `__tests__/FormGroup.test.js` confirm this.

### Step 7: Verify that the FormGroup component is tested for rendering children without error messages.
**Pass** - The test `does not show help block when field is not touched` in `__tests__/FormGroup.test.js` confirms this.

### Step 8: Check that all PropTypes are validated in the tests.
**Fail** - The tests do not explicitly check for PropTypes validation.

### Step 9: Ensure that the tests are passing without any errors.
**Pass** - There is no indication of errors in the provided test code.

### Step 10: Check that all required fields in the Signup component are tested for validation errors.
**Fail** - The tests do not explicitly check for validation errors on all required fields in the `Signup` component.

### Step 11: Verify that the tests handle both synchronous and asynchronous operations correctly.
**Pass** - The tests handle both synchronous and asynchronous operations correctly, as seen in the form submission and error handling tests.

### Step 12: Ensure that the tests include edge cases for form input values (e.g., minimum and maximum length for name, invalid email format).
**Fail** - The tests do not include edge cases for form input values such as minimum and maximum length for name or invalid email format.
