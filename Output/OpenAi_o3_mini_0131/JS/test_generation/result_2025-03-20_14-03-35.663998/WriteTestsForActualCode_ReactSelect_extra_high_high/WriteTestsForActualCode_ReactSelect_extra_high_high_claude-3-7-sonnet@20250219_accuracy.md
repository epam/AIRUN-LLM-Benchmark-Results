# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up in the test file
  
  The file correctly imports Jest and React Testing Library components:
  ```javascript
  import { render, fireEvent, screen, act } from '@testing-library/react';
  import '@testing-library/jest-dom'; // for extended expect matchers
  ```
  It also uses proper Jest functions like `describe`, `it`, `jest.fn()`, and `beforeEach`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test cases are properly isolated and do not have interdependencies

  Each test case is independent with its own render call and assertions. The `beforeEach` hook uses `jest.clearAllMocks()` to reset mocks between tests, preventing test interdependencies.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that DOM events are simulated using proper React Testing Library methods

  The test file correctly uses React Testing Library's event simulation methods:
  ```javascript
  fireEvent.mouseDown(container);
  fireEvent.keyDown(combobox, { key: 'ArrowDown' });
  fireEvent.click(option);
  fireEvent.touchStart(container, { touches: [{ clientX: 10, clientY: 10 }] });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that accessibility attributes are being tested appropriately

  The test verifies accessibility attributes in multiple places:
  ```javascript
  expect(input).toHaveAttribute('aria-autocomplete', 'list');
  expect(input).toHaveAttribute('aria-expanded', 'true');
  expect(option).toHaveAttribute('aria-selected', 'true');
  expect(input).toHaveAttribute('role', 'combobox');
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure mocks are used for external dependencies where appropriate

  The test correctly uses Jest mocks for callback functions:
  ```javascript
  onChange: jest.fn(),
  onInputChange: jest.fn(),
  onMenuOpen: jest.fn(),
  onMenuClose: jest.fn(),
  ```

- **Fail** (100%): Verify proper use of async/await for asynchronous testing where needed

  The test file doesn't include any async/await patterns even though there are scenarios that might require asynchronous testing, such as: delayed loading states, animations, or network requests. This is especially relevant when testing components that might trigger debounced or throttled events (like filtering options based on input).

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all assertions use appropriate Jest matchers

  The test uses appropriate Jest matchers throughout:
  ```javascript
  expect(screen.getByRole('combobox')).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(input).toHaveAttribute('aria-autocomplete', 'list');
  expect(minimalProps.onChange).toHaveBeenCalled();
  expect(minimalProps.onChange).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.anything(), expect.objectContaining({ action: 'select-option' }));
  ```

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that tests include proper cleanup after each test case

  While the test does use `beforeEach` to clear mocks, it doesn't explicitly use any cleanup functions like `afterEach` or React Testing Library's `cleanup`. Most modern versions of RTL automatically clean up after each test, but it's not explicitly shown here. The 90% confidence is because automatic cleanup might be in place but not visible in the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test descriptions clearly indicate what functionality is being tested

  The test uses clear, descriptive test names:
  ```javascript
  it('renders correctly with default props', () => { ... });
  it('applies required accessibility attributes', () => { ... });
  it('opens menu on control click when closed', () => { ... });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the test file follows best practices for organizing test cases (describe/it blocks)

  The test is well-organized with logical groupings in describe blocks:
  ```javascript
  describe('Select Component Rendering', () => { ... });
  describe('User Interaction Testing', () => { ... });
  describe('State Management and Value Changes', () => { ... });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that all event handlers are tested using appropriate simulation methods

  The test ver
