# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist
  
  The test suite includes a `Select Component Rendering` section with tests that verify the component renders correctly with default props. It checks for the presence of the combobox role and placeholder text.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present
  
  The test suite includes keyboard navigation tests in the `User Interaction Testing` section. Specifically, there are tests for arrow down and enter key functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)
  
  The test file includes tests for mouse interactions, with specific tests for click events (opening the menu on control click) and mouse hover events in the `User Interaction Testing` section.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior
  
  While the test suite provides extensive coverage for controlled component behavior (with props like `menuIsOpen`), there aren't explicit tests that verify uncontrolled component behavior where the component manages its own state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values
  
  The test suite includes tests for selecting values and clearing values in the `State Management and Value Changes` section.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented
  
  Tests for menu opening behavior are included in the `User Interaction Testing` section, specifically testing that the menu opens on control click.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality
  
  While the test suite provides a `filterOption` function in the props, there are no explicit tests that validate the filtering and searching functionality of the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist
  
  The test suite includes tests for multi-select functionality in the `Menu and Options Behavior` section.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility
  
  The test suite includes tests for ARIA attributes in both the `Select Component Rendering` and `Accessibility and Keyboard-only Navigation` sections.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested
  
  The test suite includes tests for empty options in the `Edge Cases and Performance` section.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states
  
  While `isLoading` is included in the props, there are no explicit tests that validate the loading state of the component. There are also no tests for error states.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states
  
  While `isOptionDisabled` is provided in the props, there are no explicit tests that validate the behavior when options are disabled or when the entire component is disabled.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance
  
  The test suite includes a test for large option sets in the `Edge Cases and Performance` section.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested
  
  While there are some tests related to focus (e.g., checking that the option gets aria-selected attribute when focused), there aren't comprehensive tests for focus management during different types of interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering
  
  The test suite includes verification of placeholder rendering in the `Select Component Rendering` section.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations
  
  While there are format functions in the props (like `formatGroupLabel`), there are no explicit tests that validate custom formatting implementations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)
  
  The test suite includes tests for callback functions, particularly testing that `onChange` and `onMenuOpen` are called in appropriate scenarios.

- **Fail** (90%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)
  
  The test suite includes a test for the clear indicator, but there are no explicit tests for dropdown or loading indicators.
