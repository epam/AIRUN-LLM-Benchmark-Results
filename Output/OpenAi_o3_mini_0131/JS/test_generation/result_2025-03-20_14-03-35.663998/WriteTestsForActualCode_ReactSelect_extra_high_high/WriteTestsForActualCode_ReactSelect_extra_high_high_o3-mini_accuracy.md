# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up in the test file  
  The test file correctly imports Jest functions and React Testing Library methods (e.g., render, fireEvent) and includes proper configuration (e.g., importing '@testing-library/jest-dom').

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test cases are properly isolated and do not have interdependencies  
  The use of beforeEach with jest.clearAllMocks ensures that mocks are reset before each test, indicating proper isolation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that DOM events are simulated using proper React Testing Library methods  
  The tests use fireEvent for simulating mouse, keyboard, and touch events, and the usage is wrapped within act when needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that accessibility attributes are being tested appropriately  
  Accessibility is verified by checking roles, aria attributes (such as aria-autocomplete and aria-expanded), and the presence of a live region, which are appropriate assertions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure mocks are used for external dependencies where appropriate  
  External dependencies such as event handlers (onChange, onMenuOpen, etc.) are mocked using jest.fn(), which is appropriate for unit tests.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify proper use of async/await for asynchronous testing where needed  
  Although none of the tests explicitly use async/await, the test scenarios appear to be synchronous. In contexts where asynchronous operations are expected, async/await should be used. Since the current tests do not require this, the approach is acceptable.  
  (Note: Confidence is 95% because while synchronous tests work well here, if asynchronous behavior were introduced, additional async handling might be necessary.)

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all assertions use appropriate Jest matchers  
  The test assertions use matchers such as toBeInTheDocument, toHaveAttribute, toHaveBeenCalled, and expect.anything(), which are correct and appropriate for the assertions made.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that tests include proper cleanup after each test case  
  The test file includes cleanup of mocks in beforeEach. Additionally, React Testing Library typically performs automatic DOM cleanup after each test, ensuring no residue affects subsequent tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test descriptions clearly indicate what functionality is being tested  
  Each describe and it block clearly states the functionality under test (e.g., rendering, user interactions, state management), making the test suite easy to understand.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the test file follows best practices for organizing test cases (describe/it blocks)  
  The tests are organized into logical describe blocks that group related tests, and each individual test case has a clear description.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that all event handlers are tested using appropriate simulation methods  
  The tests simulate events (mouse down, key down, touch events) appropriately using fireEvent, and check that the correct callbacks are invoked as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the test environment correctly simulates both mouse and keyboard interactions  
  The test file includes simulation of both mouse interactions (e.g., fireEvent.mouseDown, fireEvent.click) and keyboard interactions (e.g., fireEvent.keyDown with ArrowDown and Enter), covering both interaction types.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for touch events properly simulate mobile interactions  
  The test suite simulates touch events (touchStart, touchMove, touchEnd) on a mobile interaction target, which is an appropriate approach to verify mobile behavior.
