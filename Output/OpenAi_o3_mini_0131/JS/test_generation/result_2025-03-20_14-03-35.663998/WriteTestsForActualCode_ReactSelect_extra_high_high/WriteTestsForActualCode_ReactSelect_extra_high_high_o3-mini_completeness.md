# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist  
  The test suite includes a "Select Component Rendering" block that checks rendering of the combobox and placeholder text.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present  
  While the tests cover arrow down and Enter key interactions, there are no tests for Tab or Escape key behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)  
  The tests simulate mouse click (option selection) as well as mouse hover events, confirming the behavior.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior  
  The suite uses minimal props with a null value (uncontrolled) and tests with provided value (controlled for multi-select and clear indicator). However, the differentiation isnâ€™t very explicit, so there is slight uncertainty.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values  
  There is a test that selects an option and another that triggers clear functionality, verifying state change on selection and clearing.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented  
  Although a test exists for opening the menu via a control click, there is no explicit test verifying the menu closing behavior or the onMenuClose callback.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality  
  The provided tests do not simulate any filtering or searching interactions despite the presence of a filterOption prop.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist  
  The test "supports multi-select option addition" explicitly covers the multi-select functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility  
  The tests check for proper ARIA attributes (e.g., aria-autocomplete, aria-expanded) and include a check for the existence of an element with test ID "live-region" for screen reader feedback.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested  
  There are two tests addressing empty options: one verifying the no-options message and another handling empty options gracefully.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states  
  Despite having a loadingMessage prop, the test suite does not include any tests specifically addressing loading behavior or error states.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states  
  Although a callback for isOptionDisabled is provided in minimalProps, there are no tests checking the behavior of disabled options or the disabled state of the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance  
  A test simulating 1000 options checks that both the first and last options appear in the rendered output.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested  
  The tests include scenarios for focus changes, such as verifying that a touch event blurs the focus from the combobox and using ARIA attributes to indicate focus.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering  
  The basic rendering tests verify that the placeholder is rendered when no value exists, confirming correct display behavior.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations  
  Although the props include formatGroupLabel, there is no test that validates a custom format for option labels.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)  
  The tests validate onChange and onMenuOpen callbacks, but there are no tests for onInputChange or onMenuClose.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)  
  There is a test for the clear indicator, but no tests are provided for dropdown indicators or loading indicators.
