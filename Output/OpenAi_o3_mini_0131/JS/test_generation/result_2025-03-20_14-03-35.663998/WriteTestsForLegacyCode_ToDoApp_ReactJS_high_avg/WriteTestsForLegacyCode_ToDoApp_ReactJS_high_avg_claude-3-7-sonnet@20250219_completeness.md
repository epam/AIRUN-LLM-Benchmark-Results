# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering
- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos
- **Fail** (90%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos
  
  The app.test.tsx file doesn't explicitly test filtering functionality. While it sets up Router mocks and there is code that would interact with the routing system, there are no specific tests that verify different filters (ALL_TODOS, ACTIVE_TODOS, COMPLETED_TODOS) work correctly by checking if the appropriate todos are displayed when filters are changed.

- **Fail** (95%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
  
  While the app.test.tsx file includes a mock for clearCompleted, there is no explicit test verifying that the clearCompleted functionality works when triggered from the TodoApp component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events
- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts
- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation
- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos
- **Fail** (80%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions
  
  The provided code verifies that the subscribe functionality works by checking if the changeCallback is called when model changes occur. However, there is no explicit test for the inform function itself, only indirect testing through the callback being triggered.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data
- **Fail** (85%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented
  
  While there is a Router mock implemented in the app.test.tsx file, the tests don't fully verify that routing functionality works as expected. The tests mock the Router and verify it's initialized, but don't test the actual route changes and their effects on the displayed todos.
