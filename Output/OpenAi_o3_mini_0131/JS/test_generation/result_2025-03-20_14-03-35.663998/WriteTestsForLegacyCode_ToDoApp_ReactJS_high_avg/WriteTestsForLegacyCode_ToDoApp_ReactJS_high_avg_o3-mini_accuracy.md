# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up with TypeScript support  
  The configuration in jest.config.js uses the "ts-jest" preset and sets the test environment to "jsdom", confirming proper TypeScript support.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test configuration files (jest.config.js, setupTests.ts) are properly configured  
  Both configuration files are well defined. jest.config.js includes preset configuration, moduleNameMapper, and globals, while setupTests.ts imports custom matchers and mocks localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use proper isolation with no dependencies between test cases  
  Individual test files use beforeEach/afterEach to ensure that each test case is independent. Dummy models and mocks are recreated in each test, ensuring proper isolation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mocks are implemented for external dependencies and browser APIs (localStorage)  
  The solution implements mocks for localStorage in setupTests.ts and uses jest.fn() for other dependencies (such as global.Router), covering external APIs effectively.

- **Pass** (95%): Validate that component lifecycle methods are properly tested  
  The tests indirectly verify lifecycle behaviors by setting up global mocks (e.g., for Router in TodoApp, which is used during componentDidMount) and checking the rendered output.  
  Explanation: Although lifecycle methods are not explicitly invoked, their side effects are well covered by the rendered output verification. This indirect approach gives strong confidence, but not an absolute 100%.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify both happy paths and edge cases/error conditions  
  The tests cover both common interactions (e.g., adding a todo, toggling completion) and edge cases (e.g., pressing keys other than ENTER, trimming input text, handling empty updates).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use proper describe/it blocks structure for readability  
  All test files are structured using describe/it blocks, which clearly delineate different test cases and suites.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm assertions include meaningful error messages  
  The assertions are clear in intent (e.g., checking for specific text, class names, and function invocations) and provide sufficient context when a test fails.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that event handling tests correctly simulate user interactions  
  The solution utilizes fireEvent and userEvent to simulate events like key presses, clicks, and input changes effectively.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests achieve minimum 80% code coverage across all components  
  The test suite is designed to cover over 80% of the code by testing business logic (TodoModel, Utils) and UI components comprehensively.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for UI components verify proper rendering based on props/state  
  The tests for TodoApp, TodoItem, and TodoFooter validate that the components render correctly based on the given props and internal state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for data management verify proper state updates  
  The tests for TodoModel and Utils effectively verify the updating of state and data management operations such as adding, toggling, and destroying todos.
