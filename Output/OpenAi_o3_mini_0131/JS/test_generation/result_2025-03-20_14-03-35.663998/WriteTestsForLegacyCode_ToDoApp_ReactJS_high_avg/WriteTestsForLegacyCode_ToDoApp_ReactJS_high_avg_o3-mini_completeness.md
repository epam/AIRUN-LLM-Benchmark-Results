# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass (100%)**: Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering  
   The provided app.test.tsx file contains tests such as "renders header and input" that confirm component rendering.

2. **Pass (100%)**: Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos  
   The test "calls addTodo when ENTER_KEY is pressed and input is not empty" validates that adding new todos is handled.

3. **Pass (100%)**: Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos  
   The test "calls toggleAll with correct value on checkbox change" ensures that toggling all todos is tested.

4. **Fail (90%)**: Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos  
   The app.test.tsx file does not contain a dedicated test addressing filtering logic for todos. Although filtering behavior appears in the footer tests, there is no specific filtering test directly within app.test.tsx.  
   Explanation: I am 90% confident because filtering may be indirectly covered via the footer, but the step specifically requires tests in app.tsx.

5. **Fail (90%)**: Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
   There is no direct test in app.test.tsx that invokes or verifies the clearing of completed todos; this functionality is tested in footer.test.tsx instead.  
   Explanation: I am 90% confident because while functionality is covered overall, the step's requirement for app.test.tsx is not met.

6. **Pass (100%)**: Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering  
   The todoItem.test.tsx file includes a test "renders todo item with proper classes" to verify proper rendering.

7. **Pass (100%)**: Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos  
   Tests are present that check onEdit (editing mode), onToggle (toggling), onSave, and onDestroy functionalities.

8. **Pass (100%)**: Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events  
   The tests "calls handleSubmit on ENTER_KEY press" and "cancels editing on ESCAPE_KEY press" cover the required keyboard event handling.

9. **Pass (100%)**: Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts  
   In footer.test.tsx, tests for correct count text and button presence based on the number of completed todos are included.

10. **Pass (100%)**: Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation  
    The test "highlights the correct filter" confirms that filter navigation is properly rendered.

11. **Pass (100%)**: Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
    The test "calls onClearCompleted on button click" shows that the footer handles clearing completed todos.

12. **Pass (100%)**: Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos  
    The tests in todoModel.test.ts cover adding, toggling, saving (updating), and destroying todos.

13. **Pass (100%)**: Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions  
    The tests validate that when adding or toggling todos, the subscribed changeCallback gets notified, indirectly testing subscription handling.

14. **Pass (100%)**: Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
    The test "clears completed todos" confirms that completed todos are removed appropriately.

15. **Pass (100%)**: Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation  
    The test verifies that Utils.uuid() produces a 36-character UUID string formatted as expected.

16. **Pass (100%)**: Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality  
    Both singular and plural cases are tested in utils.test.ts.

17. **Pass (100%)**: Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations  
    The test "store sets and gets data to localStorage" demonstrates that Utils.store functions as intended with localStorage.

18. **Pass (100%)**: Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function  
    The test for Utils.extend confirms that properties of two objects are merged as expected.

19. **Pass (100%)**: Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx  
    The component test files use the .test.tsx suffix (app, todoItem, footer). Non-UI tests use .test.ts, which is acceptable given their context.

20. **Pass (100%)**: Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data  
    Dummy model and sample todo objects are consistently created in the tests (e.g., in app.test.tsx and todoItem.test.tsx).

21. **Pass (100%)**: Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented  
    The app.test.tsx file includes a setup for a global Router mock, fulfilling the routing functionality testing requirement.
