# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies Angular.js as the framework used
  
  The documentation explicitly states "It is written with Angular 1.x" in the Overview section, and throughout the document consistently references Angular 1.x concepts like factories, controllers, and directives.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all factories (REST, Page, Users) are accurately documented with their purposes
  
  All three factories are thoroughly documented with their purposes:
  - REST factory is described as a "strongly typed gateway to the RESTful back-end"
  - Page factory is described as a "singleton that holds the page currently being authored / edited"
  - Users factory is described as a "singleton with information about the signed-in user"
  
  Each factory has detailed API documentation in section 3.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of the Page controller and its functionality is technically accurate
  
  The documentation accurately describes the pageCtrl as the "controller that drives the authoring UI, orchestrates state changes, persistence, revisioning and notifications." Section 3.4 provides a detailed list of public members and their functionality, which appears technically accurate and consistent with Angular 1.x patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the RESTful API endpoints are correctly documented
  
  Section 3.1 provides a detailed table of REST endpoints with their template patterns (like `api/content/:contentID`). The documentation also notes that all resources are created with `update : { method : 'PUT' }` to allow idempotent updates, which is a technically accurate detail.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of Angular module dependencies ($resource, $location, etc.) is correct
  
  The documentation correctly identifies Angular dependencies like $resource, $upload, $location, $route, and $rootScope. The explanation of how these are used in the context of the application (e.g., "$resource instances expose the standard Action API") is technically accurate.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the page management features (creating, editing, deleting) are accurately described
  
  Section 2 (Feature Matrix) and section 4 (Usage & Integration) provide detailed explanations of CRUD operations, including the savePage() function that "decides whether to POST (create) or PUT (update)" and the deletePage() function. The common patterns section also shows concrete examples of creating and duplicating pages.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately explains how the local storage mechanism works
  
  The local draft recovery feature is well-documented in section 2.4, explaining that "Every keystroke calls saveLocal() which writes the latest values into localStorage" and "On controller start a diff is executed; if mismatches are found the banner 'newerVersion' is shown with actions Compare / Discard / Use."

- **Pass** (90%): Check that the description of form validation logic is technically accurate
  
  While form validation is implied in various functions like titleChange(), descriptionChange(), and urlChange(), there isn't an explicit section dedicated to form validation logic. The document describes input transformation (like slug generation) but doesn't clearly detail validation constraints or error handling. The functionality described appears technically accurate, but the coverage is not as comprehensive as other areas.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of publish/schedule date handling is correct
  
  Section 2.5 clearly explains scheduled publishing, noting the three radio button states, the conditional datetime input, and how the published_date is normalized to "Unix seconds (UTC)" when saving - all of which are technically accurate details.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the tag management and autocomplete feature explanation is technically accurate
  
  Tag management and autocomplete are accurately described in section 2.6, explaining how autocompleteTags() queries the API with the appropriate endpoint and how selectSuggestion() is used to pick from the suggestions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the relationship between controllers, factories, and templates is accurately explained
  
  The document clearly explains how these components relate: the Page factory serves as a singleton data store, the pageCtrl manipulates this data and handles UI events, and the template (page.html) binds to the controller. Section 4 also provides concrete examples of integration, including router configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation correctly identifies and explains the purpose of broadcast events
  
  The documentation accurately explains broadcast events in section 2.9, specifically mentioning "$rootScope.$broadcast('notify', {message, classes?})" for notifications. It also mentions other events like 'previewReload' in the examples, correctly noting these are application-wide events for communication with other subsystems.
