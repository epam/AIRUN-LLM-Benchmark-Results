# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation includes a comprehensive component overview explaining the purpose and architecture  
  The documentation opens with an "Overview" section and provides a clear description of the page authoring module’s purpose, its responsibilities, and its architectural role within the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all major components (REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and Page controller) are documented  
  Each major component is well described in the documentation, with separate sections and detailed API tables for the REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and explanation of the Page controller.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure all significant features of the page management system are described  
  The documentation covers all critical features such as CRUD operations, duplication, URL slug generation, local draft recovery, scheduled publishing, tag auto-complete, extras subsystem, revisioning, and user notifications.

- **Pass** (95%): Check that all form inputs and their behavior are documented  
  The documentation specifies how inputs are bound (e.g., `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<input type="datetime-local">`) and details the related functions in the Page controller. However, while most behaviors are clearly explained, it could benefit from a little more detail on each form input’s validation or edge-case handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page versioning and revision system  
  Revisioning is explicitly detailed, including the creation of immutable snapshots and the handling of extras during the revision process.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation covers the tag system and autocomplete functionality  
  There is a dedicated explanation for tag auto-complete, covering the functionality of querying the tags API, displaying suggestions, and the role of the `autocompleteTags()` and `selectSuggestion()` functions.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes explanation of error handling and user notifications  
  While the documentation discusses the notification bus and the use of `$rootScope.$broadcast('notify', ...)` for user notifications, it does not provide details on error handling mechanisms or how errors are managed and relayed to the user.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page publishing workflow including scheduling  
  The publishing workflow is well documented, including the use of radio buttons for state selection, the conditional display of a date/time input, and the normalization of `published_date`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation details how content extras and additional metadata are managed  
  The extras subsystem is clearly documented along with the way additional metadata is handled at both the page and revision levels.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation explains how the UI interacts with the backend APIs  
  Interaction between the UI and backend is adequately covered via the REST factory descriptions, annotations on endpoints, and usage examples in the integration and router sections.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes sample usage examples or patterns  
  The documentation provides practical usage examples and common patterns, including code snippets for creating a page, duplicating a page, and integrating the template within the admin shell.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains all significant event broadcasting and inter-component communication  
  The documentation explains the use of `$rootScope.$broadcast` for events (e.g., notifications and preview reloads) and outlines how components communicate within the module.
