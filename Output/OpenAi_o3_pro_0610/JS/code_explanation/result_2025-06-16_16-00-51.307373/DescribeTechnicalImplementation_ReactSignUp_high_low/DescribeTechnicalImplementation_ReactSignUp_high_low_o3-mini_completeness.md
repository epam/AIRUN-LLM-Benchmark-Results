- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation includes a concise overview of the component's purpose and functionality  
  The documentation begins with a clear "Overview" section that concisely explains that the component is a self-contained React/Redux-Form signup component, describing its purpose and basic functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all props (fields, handleSubmit, submitting, asyncValidating, dispatch) are documented  
  All required props are detailed in a well-organized table, including types, whether they are required, and their descriptions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation covers the FormGroup component's validation feedback mechanism

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that both synchronous and asynchronous validation processes are fully documented  
  Both synchronous (using `validate(values)`) and asynchronous (using `asyncValidate(values)` and `asyncBlurFields`) validation processes are clearly explained, including specific validation rules and their triggers.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation explains the form submission process and error handling  
  The form submission process is well-documented, detailing how the `handleSubmit(values)` method makes an API call, triggers success actions, and manages error handling through returned promises.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure usage examples demonstrate proper component integration and prop configurations

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation concludes with a summary highlighting key benefits, accessibility compliance, and performance considerations  
  A clear summary is provided at the end, listing the benefits, accessibility features, and performance notes of the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the component's internal structure and state management approach are fully documented  
  The "Architecture & Internal Flow" section covers internal aspects including HOC decoration, lack of local state, and usage of Redux-Form state management, offering a comprehensive look at the component's structure.
