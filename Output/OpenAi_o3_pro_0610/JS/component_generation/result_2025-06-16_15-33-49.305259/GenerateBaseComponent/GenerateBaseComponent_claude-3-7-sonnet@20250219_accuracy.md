# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x
  
  The imports include React hooks like `useId` which was introduced in React 18, and the code comment explicitly mentions "React 18 + TypeScript".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
  
  The code uses TypeScript with proper type definitions throughout. The component includes interfaces (`Option<T>`, `SearchableSelectProps<T>`), generic type parameters, and proper type annotations for all functions, parameters, and variables.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling
  
  The code includes an index.css file with appropriate styling for the searchable select component.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments
  
  The code is clean, well-organized, and there are no TODO comments anywhere in the implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility
  
  The component properly uses React's `useState` hooks for managing state:
  ```tsx
  const [isOpen, setOpen] = useState(false);
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
  const [highlighted, setHighlighted] = useState<number>(-1);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props
  
  The component accepts various props through the `SearchableSelectProps` interface, including:
  - `options` - list of selectable items
  - `value` - currently selected value
  - `onChange` - callback for selection changes
  - `placeholder` - customizable placeholder text
  - `className` - additional CSS class
  - `disabled` - for disabling the component

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection
  
  The component has comprehensive keyboard navigation with handlers for:
  - Arrow keys for navigating options
  - Enter/Space for opening/closing and selecting
  - Escape for closing the dropdown
  - All keyboard interactions are properly implemented with preventDefault() where needed

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions
  
  The component follows best practices for refs:
  - Uses `useRef` for DOM references
  - Properly handles forwarded refs
  - Accesses DOM elements safely through refs
  - Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for focus management

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques
  
  The component handles focus properly:
  - Automatically focuses the search input when opened
  - Returns focus to the toggle when closed
  - Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for reliable focus timing
  - Manages focus containment within the component

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
  
  The component uses appropriate ARIA attributes:
  - `role="combobox"`, `role="listbox"`, `role="option"`
  - `aria-controls`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-haspopup`
  - `aria-owns`, `aria-activedescendant`
  - `aria-selected`, `aria-disabled`, `aria-label`

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  There are no console.log, console.error, or console.warn statements in the code, and the implementation follows patterns that would avoid React warnings.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component
  
  The component uses proper memoization techniques:
  - `useMemo` for computed values like `selected` and `filtered`
  - `useCallback` for event handlers and functions
  - Dependencies arrays are properly defined for all hooks
