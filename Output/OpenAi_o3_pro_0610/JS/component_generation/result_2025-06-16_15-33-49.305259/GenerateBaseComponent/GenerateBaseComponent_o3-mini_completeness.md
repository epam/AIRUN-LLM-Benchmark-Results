# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component returns a main container with the CSS class "searchable-select", a toggle element, and conditionally renders the dropdown panel when opened.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  When the dropdown is open, an <input> element with class "search-input" is rendered to allow searching.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The code only permits one selected value at a time by using a controlled property "value" and updating via onChange when an option is chosen.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The component handles ArrowDown and ArrowUp key events in the input’s onKeyDown, allowing the highlighted index to change accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  Both in the input’s keyDown handler and the container’s keyDown handler, the Enter key commits the selection when an item is highlighted or toggles the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  The container’s onKeyDown detects the Enter key and calls toggle(), which either opens or closes the dropdown based on its current state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  The close() function explicitly calls toggleRef.current?.focus(), ensuring that focus returns to the toggle element after the dropdown is closed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  The list item (<li>) elements have an onClick handler that calls commitSelection, which in turn calls close() to dismiss the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  When the Enter key is pressed with a highlighted option, commitSelection is called (via the input’s onKeyDown), which then closes the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  Both the input’s keyDown handler and a global keydown listener (added via useEffect) capture the Escape key and call close().

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  A useEffect attachment listens for mousedown events on the document and, if the click occurs outside containerRef.current, calls close().

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  The container’s onKeyDown handler listens for the Enter key and toggles the dropdown; if closed, Enter will call open().
