# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The application fetches character data from the SWAPI API (`https://swapi.dev/api/people`) and renders it using the `CharacterList` component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The application shows a "Loadingâ€¦" message when the `loading` state is true, which is set during API calls and cleared once the data is fetched or an error occurs.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The application uses a `fetchAllPeople` function that recursively fetches all paginated data until `next` is null, ensuring all characters are retrieved and displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  The application does not contain any search functionality or user input fields. It simply displays the full list of characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  The `CharacterList` component maps through each character and displays its name within a list item element.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The project structure and package.json file are consistent with a Create React App project. The code references the use of CRA, and includes the standard scripts and dependencies for a CRA TypeScript application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The application uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) to manage three states: `characters` (the list of characters), `loading` (to indicate when data is being fetched), and `error` (to handle error messages).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each list item in the `CharacterList` component uses the character's URL as a unique key, which ensures optimal rendering performance.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  If the API call fails, an error message is displayed. During loading, a loading indicator is shown. The application doesn't explicitly handle an empty successful response, but the CharacterList would render an empty list if no characters were returned.
