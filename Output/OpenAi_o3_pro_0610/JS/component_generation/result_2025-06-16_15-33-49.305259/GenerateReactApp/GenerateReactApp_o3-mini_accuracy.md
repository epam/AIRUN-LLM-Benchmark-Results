# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses React 18.x or newer by checking the package.json dependencies  
  The package.json specifies "react": "^18.2.0" and "react-dom": "^18.2.0", which confirms the use of a React 18 version.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that TypeScript is properly implemented with appropriate type definitions for all components, props, and states  
  The project uses .tsx files, defines interfaces (e.g., Character, ApiResponse), and properly types props and states, satisfying the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Axios is used for API requests to fetch data from the Star Wars API endpoint  
  Axios is clearly imported and used in the asynchronous function fetchAllPeople to make GET requests from "https://swapi.dev/api/people".

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles API errors gracefully with appropriate error states or messages  
  The code uses try-catch in the async data fetching function and sets an error state displaying a red-colored error message when the API call fails.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the character data is fetched on component mount using useEffect hook  
  The App component employs the useEffect hook to call load() during component mount, ensuring the data is fetched when the component is first rendered.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application properly manages component rendering optimization  
  The CharacterList component is wrapped with React.memo, which prevents unnecessary re-renders when props do not change.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code follows React best practices using hooks appropriately  
  The code utilizes useState for state management, useEffect for side effects, and properly cleans up with AbortController to prevent memory leaks.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't contain any TODO comments or unnecessary code  
  There are no TODO comments, and the code maintains a minimal and clean structure free of extraneous or commented-out code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the codebase has minimal comments that only clarify complex logic when necessary  
  The code includes only necessary comments (e.g., file structure outline) and does not include excessive or redundant commentary.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the API endpoint 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' is being called correctly  
  The fetchAllPeople function uses the exact URL "https://swapi.dev/api/people" and correctly handles the pagination via the "next" property.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application renders without console errors or warnings  
  Based on the provided code, it follows standard CRA patterns and TypeScript best practices, suggesting that it should render without console errors or warnings.  
  Note: While confident in the code quality, an actual runtime test is required to be 100% certain of the absence of console issues.
