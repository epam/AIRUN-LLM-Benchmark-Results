# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The App component fetches data from SWAPI and passes the resulting list of characters to the CharacterList component, which renders each character’s name.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The code displays a `<p>` element with the text “Loading…” while the HTTP request is in progress, indicating a visual loading state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  The implementation loops through paginated results until there are no more pages and renders all characters in the list.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  There are no search forms or input fields implemented; the UI only consists of a list for displaying characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  In the CharacterList component, each character's name is rendered correctly within a list item using the URL as a unique key.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The file structure and package dependencies (including react-scripts) indicate that the project was bootstrapped with Create React App using a TypeScript template.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The App component manages loading, error, and character data through dedicated state variables (using useState) and updates them appropriately using useEffect.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  Each list item is assigned a unique key based on the character’s URL, which is an appropriate choice to ensure optimal rendering in React.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  When no characters are available (e.g., if the API returns an empty list), the CharacterList component will render an empty `<ul>`. While it doesn't display a specific message for empty data, this minimal handling is acceptable given the requirements.
