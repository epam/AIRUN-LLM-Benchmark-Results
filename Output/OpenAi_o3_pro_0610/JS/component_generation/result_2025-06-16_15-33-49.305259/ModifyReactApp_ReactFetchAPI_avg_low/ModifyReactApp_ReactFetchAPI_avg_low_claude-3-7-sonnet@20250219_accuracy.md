# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type
  
  The implementation correctly updates state when users type with this code:
  ```tsx
  const [search, setSearch] = useState<string>('');
  const handleSearchChange = useCallback(
    (e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => setSearch(e.target.value),
    [],
  );
  ```
  And the input is properly bound with value and onChange handler.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls
  
  The code implements a custom `useDebounce` hook with a default delay of 400ms, which falls within the required 300-500ms range:
  ```tsx
  function useDebounce<T>(value: T, delay = 400): T {
    const [debouncedValue, setDebouncedValue] = useState<T>(value);
    useEffect(() => {
      const id = window.setTimeout(() => setDebouncedValue(value), delay);
      return () => window.clearTimeout(id);
    }, [value, delay]);
    return debouncedValue;
  }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured
  
  Axios is correctly imported and used for API requests with proper configuration including cancel tokens and parameters:
  ```tsx
  import axios, { CancelTokenSource } from 'axios';
  // ...
  const { data } = await axios.get<PeopleResponse>(
    'https://swapi.dev/api/people',
    {
      params: { search: debouncedSearch },
      cancelToken: cancelToken.token,
    },
  );
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses
  
  The code uses proper TypeScript typing throughout, including:
  - Interface definitions for Character and PeopleResponse
  - Generic typing for the useDebounce hook
  - Proper typing for all state variables and function parameters
  - React.FC type for the main component
  - Typing for the axios response

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters
  
  The API endpoint is properly constructed using axios's params option:
  ```tsx
  const { data } = await axios.get<PeopleResponse>(
    'https://swapi.dev/api/people',
    {
      params: { search: debouncedSearch },
      cancelToken: cancelToken.token,
    },
  );
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate
  
  The code uses both useMemo and useCallback appropriately:
  - useCallback for the search input change handler
  - useMemo for sorting the characters array, preventing unnecessary re-sorting

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback
  
  Error handling is properly implemented with:
  - Try/catch block around the API request
  - Error state management: `const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);`
  - User feedback in the UI: `{error && !loading && (<p className="characters__feedback characters__feedback--error">{error}</p>)}`
  - Console error logging
  - Special handling for cancelled requests

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing
  
  The implementation uses the debouncedSearch value in the useEffect dependency array, ensuring API calls are only triggered after the user stops typing:
  ```tsx
  useEffect(() => {
    // fetch logic
  }, [debouncedSearch]);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices
  
  The implementation follows React best practices for state management:
  - Separate state variables for raw input and API results
  - Proper initialization of state
  - Clean separation of concerns with callbacks, effects, and memoization
  - Proper cleanup in useEffect

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code
  
  The code is clean with:
  - No unused imports (all imports are utilized)
  - No commented-out code (only comments for organization)
  - No apparent console errors in the implementation
  - Well-structured code with clear section divisions

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests
  
  Loading state is properly managed:
  ```tsx
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(false);
  // In the fetch function:
  setLoading(true);
  // After request completion:
  setLoading(false);
  // UI feedback:
  {loading && <p className="characters__feedback">Loadingâ€¦</p>}
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns
  
  The implementation follows React 18.x patterns:
  - Using modern hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo)
  - Proper JSX syntax and functional component approach
  - React.StrictMode in the root render
  - Using createRoot API from React DOM which is specific to React 18
