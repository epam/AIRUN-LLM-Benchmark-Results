# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name
  
  The code includes an input field with type="search" that captures user input and triggers an API call with the search parameter to filter characters by name.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests
  
  The component includes a loading state that displays "Loading..." when the loading state is true, which is set during API requests.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query
  
  The useEffect hook that fetches characters runs on component mount with an initially empty debouncedSearch value, which sends an empty search parameter to the API.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type
  
  The code implements a useDebounce hook that triggers new API requests after a delay (400ms) when the user types, updating the results dynamically.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found
  
  The component displays "No characters found." when sortedCharacters.length is 0 and there is no loading or error state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design
  
  The CSS includes responsive design elements such as max-width with fluid width (100%), proper padding and margin settings to ensure the component works well on different screen sizes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response
  
  After the API response, the characters state is updated with data.results, and the sortedCharacters (derived from characters) are displayed in the list.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed
  
  An ErrorBoundary component is implemented and wraps the CharacterList component in the index.tsx file, providing fallback UI when unexpected errors occur.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props
  
  The code defines appropriate TypeScript interfaces including Character, PeopleResponse, and proper typing for all state variables, function parameters, and return types.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities
  
  The implementation maintains the original functionality of displaying characters while adding search capabilities, proper error handling, and performance optimizations.
