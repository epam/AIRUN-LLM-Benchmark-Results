# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type  
  The input field uses a controlled component pattern with the state variable "search" updated on each keystroke via the "handleSearchChange" callback.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls  
  The custom hook "useDebounce" uses a default delay of 400ms, which falls within the required interval.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured  
  Axios is imported and used to perform GET requests, and a CancelToken is implemented to cancel requests appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses  
  Interfaces such as "Character" and "PeopleResponse" are used throughout along with proper annotations in function and component definitions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters  
  The code constructs the API endpoint to include "search" as a query parameter, fulfilling the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate  
  Both "useMemo" and "useCallback" are correctly implemented for memoizing sorted characters and the search input handler, respectively.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback  
  The code includes a try-catch block where errors (except cancellations) trigger a friendly error message and are logged to the console.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing  
  By using the debounced search value, API calls are deferred until the user has paused typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices  
  The code uses useState to manage state across search input, loading status, error messages, and character results in a clean and efficient way.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code  
  The implementation is clean with relevant imports and no extraneous commented-out code, ensuring maintainability.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests  
  The "loading" state is correctly set before the API call and reset in the finally block of the try-catch-finally structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns  
  The code uses ReactDOM.createRoot for rendering and adheres to updated React practices with functional components and hooks.
