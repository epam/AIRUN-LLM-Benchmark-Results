# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The code contains an <input> element with type="search" and a handler (handleSearchChange) that updates the search state, which is used to filter characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  A loading state is managed via setLoading, and when true, a “Loading…” message is displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  The search state is initially set to an empty string. Therefore, on mount, the debounced search value is empty, triggering an API call that retrieves all characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  The useDebounce hook updates debouncedSearch after a delay based on the raw input, and useEffect fetches updated results using the new search term.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  The component renders a message “No characters found.” when not loading, no error exists, and the sortedCharacters array is empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The CSS ensures a max-width and fluid behavior with a 100% search input width, making the UI responsive across devices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  After fetching, the characters are set into state and sorted, then rendered inside a list (using map on sortedCharacters), fulfilling this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  An ErrorBoundary component is provided and used in index.tsx to wrap the CharacterList, thereby catching any unforeseen errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The required interfaces (Character, PeopleResponse) and strict type annotations for component state and props are implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The solution integrates the new debouncing search capability without affecting the initial “fetch all” behavior or other parts of the component’s functionality.
