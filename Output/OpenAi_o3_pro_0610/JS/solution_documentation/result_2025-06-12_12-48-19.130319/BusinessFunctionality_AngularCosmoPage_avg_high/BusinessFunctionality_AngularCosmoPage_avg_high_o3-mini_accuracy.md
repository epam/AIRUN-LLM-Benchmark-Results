# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies the application as an Angular.js application for web content management  
  The documentation clearly mentions “AngularJS” and uses Angular-specific terminology (e.g., controllers, factories, ngRoute, ngResource), confirming it is indeed an Angular.js application designed for managing web content.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately describes the REST factory for backend communication  
  The report explains that the REST factory is a thin wrapper around $resource and exposes CRUD endpoints with conventional RESTful URIs, which is accurate.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation correctly explains the Page factory for storing global page variables  
  It notes that the Page factory acts as a single in-memory object used as a global cache for the currently edited page, which is consistent with the provided details.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately describes the Users factory for storing current user data  
  The documentation specifies that the Users factory holds the currently logged-in user, aligning well with the description.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation correctly explains the page controller functionality  
  The explanation indicates that pageCtrl orchestrates the UI, business logic, and persistence, and interacts with the Page factory and REST services. This is an accurate summary of the controller’s role.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation accurately explains the page creation and editing process  
  The report details both “Create new page” and “Edit existing page” workflows, outlining the sequence of REST calls and the redirection patterns, which accurately captures the process.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately describes the local storage recovery mechanism for unsaved changes  
  The description mentions that unsaved local modifications are stored in browser localStorage and that an alert is shown when a newer unsaved version is available, which correctly reflects the recovery mechanism.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm that the documentation correctly explains the version comparison and management features  
  The documentation mentions an alert for “There is a newer unsaved local version” and describes the creation of immutable revisions during saves. Although it does not elaborate in great depth on version comparison, the essential aspects of version management are covered.  
  *Explanation:* The term “version comparison” isn’t explicitly detailed; however, the processes to manage revisions and identify unsaved changes are clearly described.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation accurately describes the page deletion workflow  
  It correctly explains that deleting a page involves a confirmation step, followed by a cascade deletion (content, revisions, extras, tags), and then redirection, which matches the provided details.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately explains the auto-URL generation from title functionality  
  The documentation states that the URL slug editor auto-generates the URL while typing the title (until the user manually edits it), which accurately reflects the functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation correctly describes the tag autocompletion and suggestion system  
  The report describes the tag input field with auto-complete (capped at 10 suggestions) and mentions an endpoint that returns suggested tags, which is consistent with the system’s design.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation accurately explains the publication scheduling system  
  It clearly describes the publish state options (Publish now, Draft, Schedule), including the use of a date-time picker for scheduled publications and the associated business rules.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately describes the handling of page revisions and extras  
  The explanation includes that every save creates a new immutable revision and that extras, along with tags, are managed in separate steps, which accurately captures the process.
