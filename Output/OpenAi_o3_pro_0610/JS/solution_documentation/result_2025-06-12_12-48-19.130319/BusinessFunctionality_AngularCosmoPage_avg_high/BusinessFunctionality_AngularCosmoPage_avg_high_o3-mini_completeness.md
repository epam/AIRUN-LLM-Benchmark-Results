# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation identifies all major components (REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, pageCtrl)  
  The answer clearly lists the REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and pageCtrl among the main components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the purpose of the REST factory for API communication  
  The documentation states that the REST factory is "a thin wrapper around $resource that exposes CRUD endpoints," which implies its purpose for API communication.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes all API endpoints exposed in the REST factory  
  The answer enumerates several endpoints (blocks, content, revisions, extras, tags, users, etc.), covering the scope of API endpoints.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the documentation explains the Page factory and its role in storing global page variables  
  It is explicitly mentioned that the Page factory is a "single in-memory object acting as a global cache" for the currently edited page.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the Users factory and its purpose for user data management  
  The documentation explains that the Users factory holds the currently logged-in user.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page controller's responsibilities and features  
  The answer details that pageCtrl orchestrates UI, business logic, and persistence, and it exposes data to page.html.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm the documentation describes the local storage mechanism for unsaved changes  
  The answer explains that local unsaved modifications are stored in browser localStorage for recovery on the next visit.  
  (Minor caveat: while the basic mechanism is described, additional implementation details might add further clarity.)

- **Fail** (90%): Validate documentation explains the version comparison functionality  
  The answer only indirectly hints at version-related logic through the alert message "There is a newer unsaved local version" without a detailed explanation of how versions are compared or managed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the page creation workflow  
  The "Create new page" workflow is clearly described, including the route, form filling, and subsequent API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page editing workflow  
  It outlines the "Edit existing page" process and the corresponding REST call updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the page duplication feature  
  The duplication process is described, including how it forces a new URL and uses the same save flow.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate documentation explains the page deletion process  
  The deletion process is well detailed, including the cascade delete (content, revisions, extras, tags) and redirection.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the auto-URL generation from title feature  
  The answer covers the URL slug editor functionality, which auto-generates based on the title until manually edited.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains tag management and autocompletion  
  Tag input with auto-complete and a maximum of 10 suggestions is clearly mentioned, along with the related API call details.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the publication status options (publish, draft, schedule)  
  The documentation lists the publish state radio buttons and the corresponding options.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate documentation explains scheduled content publishing  
  Details on how "publish == 'schedule'" changes to a draft if scheduled in the future (and converts to 'Y' when past) are provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes page revision management  
  Revisions are defined as immutable snapshots captured during saves, and the workflow for creating a new revision is explained.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify documentation explains the handling of page extras and additional data  
  The handling of extras is described both in the data model (arbitrary key/value meta data) and during API calls (POSTed after the main content).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes form validation mechanisms  
  The answer specifies hard stops with translated error notifications for various validation issues (e.g., duplicate URL, no page type, blank URL).

- **Pass** (90%): Validate documentation explains error handling during API operations  
  The answer mentions success/failure toasts and notifications, implying error handling for API operations; however, more detailed handling logic is not explicitly outlined.  
  (Confidence is slightly less than 100% because while user notifications are mentioned, internal API error handling specifics are not deeply elaborated.)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes notification messaging for user feedback  
  It clearly describes the use of translated success/failure toasts and communication via $translate and $broadcast for notifications.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the theme-specific page types feature  
  The answer mentions the page type selector populated from themePages and the business rule that a page must belong to one of the themeâ€™s allowed page types.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the documentation describes the featured image handling  
  There is no reference or description of any featured image handling in the documentation.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate documentation explains URL validation and error handling  
  The documentation includes validations to prevent blank, 'new', or duplicate URLs and provides error notifications for these situations.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation describes the tag suggestion system based on user input  
  The tag suggestion system is described by noting that an API call is made on every keystroke with a debounce suggestion cap (limitTo:10).
