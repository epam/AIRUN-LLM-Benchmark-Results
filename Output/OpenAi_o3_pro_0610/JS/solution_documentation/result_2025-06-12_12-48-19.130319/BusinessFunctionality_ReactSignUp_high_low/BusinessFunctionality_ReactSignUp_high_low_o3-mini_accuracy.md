# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies the application as a React signup form for PodBaby platform  
  The documentation clearly states that the visitor can create a new PodBaby account via a signup form with fields for name, email, and password.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately describes the validation rules for name (3-60 characters), email (valid format), and password (minimum 6 characters)  
  The rules are explicitly stated under "Business-requirements summary" and reiterated in the "Business logic & rules" section.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation correctly explains the asynchronous validation for checking existing usernames and emails  
  It is mentioned that asynchronous uniqueness checks are triggered on field blur using Promise.all, ensuring that both username and email uniqueness are verified concurrently.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately describes the form submission process and API interaction  
  The documentation details that on submit, the submit button is disabled, the API (api.signup) is called, and on success, a Redux action (signupComplete) is dispatched.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation correctly explains the Redux integration for state management  
  The documentation explains that the Signup container component interacts with Redux (dispatching auth actions) and notes that redux-form manages local form state.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation accurately describes the form feedback mechanisms for validation errors  
  It clearly details the visual feedback (red/green borders, help text) shown on each field based on validation status.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately describes the FormGroup component's role in displaying validation feedback  
  The FormGroup is explained as a dumb/presentational component that wraps each Redux-form field and applies appropriate Bootstrap feedback styles.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation correctly explains the Promise-based architecture for parallel validation checks  
  The use of Promise.all to run email and name uniqueness checks in parallel is explicitly mentioned.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the documentation accurately describes the user flow from form completion to successful signup  
  The user flow is detailed step-by-step from landing on the page, filling the form, getting validations, to finally submitting the form and handling success or failure.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation accurately explains the error handling during form submission  
  It explains that on API/sign-up errors, redux-form surfaces server errors (as _error or field-level errors) and resets the submit button state.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the documentation correctly identifies the document title management using react-document-title  
  The documentation only mentions a "Semantic page title ('Signup')" but does not reference react-document-title, which was expected by the evaluation step.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that the documentation accurately describes the integration with React Router for navigation  
  While the documentation notes that a user navigates to “/signup” and a login link is provided, it does not explicitly reference or explain React Router integration.
