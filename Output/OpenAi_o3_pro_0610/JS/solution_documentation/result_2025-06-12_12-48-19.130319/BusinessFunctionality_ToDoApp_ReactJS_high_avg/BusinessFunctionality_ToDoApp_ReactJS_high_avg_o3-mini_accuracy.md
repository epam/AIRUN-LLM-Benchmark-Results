# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document identifies the application as a Todo list management application  
  The document clearly describes the application as a “TodoMVC” implementation, which is a Todo list management application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the component structure (TodoApp, TodoItem, TodoFooter)  
  The answer details the component tree by listing TodoApp, Header, Main section (including TodoItem) and TodoFooter.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of local storage for data persistence  
  The document mentions the LocalStorage key (`react-todos`) and explains its use for persisting the todos across browser reloads.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the state management approach using the TodoModel  
  The answer explains that TodoModel.todos is the “single source of truth” and details its pub/sub mechanism for state updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the routing mechanism for filtering todos  
  The document clearly describes the use of hash routes (“#/”, “#/active”, “#/completed”) and the global router for managing filters.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the event handling for user interactions  
  Detailed descriptions of interactions (e.g., adding todos via ENTER, double-click to edit, using checkboxes) confirm proper identification of event handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of immutable data structures for state management  
  The explanation mentions the creation of new arrays via immutable methods (map, filter, concat) when updating the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the performance optimization using shouldComponentUpdate  
  The answer points out that TodoItem’s shouldComponentUpdate is used to avoid unnecessary DOM operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of the Utils class for helper functions  
  The document mentions “Utils.store()” as being used for abstracting LocalStorage read/write operations, adequately identifying its role.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the data flow between components  
  The answer includes a data flow diagram describing user interaction, event handling, model updates, persistence, and re-rendering of the application components.
