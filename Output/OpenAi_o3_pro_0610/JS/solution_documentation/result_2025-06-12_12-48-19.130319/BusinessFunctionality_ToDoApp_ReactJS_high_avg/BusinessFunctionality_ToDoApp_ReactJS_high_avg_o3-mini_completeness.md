# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers all main functionality including adding, editing, deleting, and toggling todos  
  The document clearly lists core features such as adding a new todo, in-place editing, deleting (destroy), and toggling the completion status of individual todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about filtering todos by status (all, active, completed)  
  Filtering functionality is detailed with explicit hash routes (e.g., “#/”, “#/active”, “#/completed”) and the corresponding UI implications.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the user workflow for creating new todo items  
  The user workflow section explains how the user lands on the application, inputs a new todo item, and sees it added (with auto-clear of the input field).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the editing functionality triggered by double-clicking  
  The analysis details that double-clicking an item's label initiates edit mode, including specifics on saving via ENTER/blur or cancelling with ESC.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the clear completed functionality  
  The document mentions the “Clear completed” button and its behavior to remove all completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the toggle all functionality  
  It covers the toggle-all switch, explaining how it marks every item as complete or active, with reference to maintaining the master checkbox state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the counter for remaining items  
  The inclusion of a “Remaining-items counter” and the dynamic pluralisation (“1 item left” vs “n items left”) confirms this functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the persistent storage of todos  
  The analysis outlines the use of LocalStorage (with mention of key `react-todos`) and details how persistence is managed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the UI components and their relationships  
  A detailed component tree and the discussion of component responsibilities (e.g., TodoApp, Header, TodoItem, TodoFooter) are provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the business objectives addressed by the application  
  The business goals, such as providing a lightweight task list and maintaining best-practice patterns in React, are clearly explained.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes performance and scalability considerations  
  Optimizations, limitations, and potential enhancements regarding performance and scalability are discussed in-depth.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes technical constraints and limitations  
  The technical constraints (e.g., reliance on LocalStorage, assumptions on the browser environment, routing pre-requisites) are explicitly stated.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the pluralization of item/items text based on count  
  The analysis includes dynamic pluralisation as a secondary behaviour, highlighting the logic for “1 item left” versus “n items left.”
