# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented
  
  The code clearly implements all the page management functionality:
  - Create: Implemented via `api.create` and handled in the `savePage` thunk
  - Update: Implemented via `api.update` and handled in the `savePage` thunk
  - Delete: Implemented via `api.remove` and the `deletePage` thunk
  - Duplicate: Implemented in the `handleSave(true)` function in PageEditor

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present
  
  Page type selection is implemented through a select dropdown in the PageEditor component, which maps through `page.themePages` and updates the Redux store via `dispatch(setField({ key: 'type', value: e.target.value }))`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists
  
  URL auto-generation is implemented in the `handleTitleChange` function that converts the title to a URL-friendly format when `autoURL` is true:
  ```javascript
  if (autoURL)
    dispatch(
      setField({
        key: 'url',
        value: value
          .toLowerCase()
          .replace(/ /g, '-')
          .replace(/[.,\/#!$%\^&\*;:{}=_`~()?\']/g, ''),
      })
    );
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented
  
  Tag management is implemented with a dedicated `TagSuggestions` component and functionality to:
  - Add tags through input field
  - Get suggestions based on typing
  - Add suggested tags via clicking
  - Clear suggestions

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are present
  
  The code includes a radio button group for selecting publish status with all three options:
  - Publish (`'Y'`)
  - Draft (`'N'`)
  - Schedule (`'schedule'`)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented
  
  Scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented with a DatePicker component that appears conditionally when `page.publish === 'schedule'`. The component handles date selection and updates the `scheduleDate` field in the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present
  
  Local storage is managed through:
  - A custom `useLocalStorage` hook
  - An effect in PageEditor that saves changes to local storage
  - A `newerVersion` flag in the page state
  - A UI notification when newer version exists
  - A `revertLocal` action to restore from local storage

- **Pass** (90%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented
  
  The code uses alerts for notifications such as:
  - `alert(t('saved'))` for successful saves
  - `alert(t('page_error_saving'))` for error handling
  - `alert(t('page_no_url'))` for validation errors
  
  However, I'm 90% confident because the code might benefit from a more sophisticated notification system beyond browser alerts.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present
  
  Form validation is implemented in the `handleSave` function with checks for:
  - URL validation (`!page.url || page.url === 'new'`)
  - Page type validation (`!page.type`)
  - Duplicate URL validation (`duplicate && page.url === url`)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled
  
  The code includes API handlers for all necessary operations:
  - `/content/:url` (GET) for fetching by URL
  - `/content/:id` (GET) for fetching by ID
  - `/content` (POST) for creating pages
  - `/content/:id` (PUT) for updating pages
  - `/content/:id` (DELETE) for deleting pages
  - `/content/:id/tags` (GET, POST, DELETE) for tag operations

- **Fail** (95%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented
  
  While the `PageExtras` interface is defined in the data models and the `extras` field is included in the page state, there's no explicit UI component or functionality in the provided code that manages page extras. The `extras` field is defined as:
  ```typescript
  export interface PageExtras {
    [key: string]: string | number | boolean | object | null;
  }
  ```
  But no UI or handlers for managing these extras are shown in the PageEditor component.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained
  
  There is no mention or implementation of revision history functionality in the provided code. This would typically include displaying version history, comparing versions, or restoring previous versions beyond just the local storage comparison.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components
  
  The code follows a clear organization pattern:
  - Feature folders (e.g., `features/page/`)
  - Business logic in slice files (e.g., `pageSlice.ts`)
  - UI components in separate files (e.g., `PageEditor.tsx`, `TagSuggestions.tsx`)
  - API calls in dedicated modules (`api/pages.ts`, etc.)
  - Reusable hooks in their own folder (`hooks/useLocalStorage.ts`)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved
  
  Translation functionality is implemented using react-i18next:
  - i18n setup in `src/i18n/index.ts`
  - Translation files in `src/i18n/translations/*.json`
  - The `useTranslation` hook used in components
  - Translation keys used throughout the UI (`t('page_details')`, etc.)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters
  
  The routing structure in `AppRoutes.tsx` maintains the same URL patterns:
  - `/new` for creating new pages
  - `/:url` for viewing/editing existing pages by URL
