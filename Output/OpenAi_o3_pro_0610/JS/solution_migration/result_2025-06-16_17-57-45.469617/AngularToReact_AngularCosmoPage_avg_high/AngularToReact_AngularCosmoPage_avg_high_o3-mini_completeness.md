# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
   → The code defines async thunks and related slice actions for creating/updating (savePage), deleting (deletePage), and duplicate functionality (via handleSave with duplicate flag).

2. **Pass** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
   → The Page Editor component renders a select element that lists available page types from page.themePages and updates the state accordingly.

3. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
   → The handleTitleChange function auto-generates a URL based on the title when autoURL is enabled, ensuring this functionality is implemented.

4. **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
   → A dedicated TagSuggestions component is provided, and tag management (adding tags and clearing suggestions) is handled in the pageSlice, ensuring autocomplete suggestions functionality.

5. **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
   → The form includes a radio button group for 'publish', 'draft', and 'schedule', confirming the availability of publish status options.

6. **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
   → A DatePicker is conditionally rendered when the publish status is 'schedule'. The scheduled date is managed and appropriately updated in state.

7. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
   → The code employs a useLocalStorage hook to persist editor fields and a “revertLocal” action in the slice to restore from local storage, along with a flag (page.newerVersion) to notify about version differences.

8. **Pass** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
   → Notifications are provided through alert dialogs upon successful saves or errors (e.g., alert(t('saved')) and alert(t('page_error_saving'))), serving as a basic notification system.

9. **Pass** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
   → The handleSave function performs validations for required fields such as page.type and page.url, ensuring that the form cannot be submitted without meeting these requirements.

10. **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
    → The API helper files (pages.ts, tags.ts) cover endpoints for reading (getByUrl, getById), creating, updating, and deleting content. The related async thunks in the slice align with these endpoints.

11. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
    → Although the Page model includes an "extras" property and it is initialized in the state, there are no explicit actions or UI elements to update or manage this field. This indicates that extras management functionality is not fully implemented.

12. **Fail** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
    → While the code shows a "newerVersion" flag and a revertLocal action suggesting a local storage-based version check, there is no detailed implementation of a revision history system (e.g., tracking multiple revisions or undo/redo functionality). This functionality appears to be only partially addressed.

13. **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
    → The project structure clearly separates API, app logic, features, hooks, routes, i18n, and types into distinct folders.

14. **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
    → The i18n configuration and use of react-i18next throughout the code (with translation keys like t('page_details'), etc.) confirm that translation support is well preserved.

15. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
    → The routing defined in AppRoutes uses "/new" and "/:url", which maintains the URL structure and parameters as expected.
