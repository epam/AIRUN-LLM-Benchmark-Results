# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The SignupComponent is built using FormBuilder with fb.group, and the module imports ReactiveFormsModule.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The component defines a nameLengthValidator (checking between 3 and 60 characters), uses Angular's built-in Validators.email for email, and has a passwordLengthValidator ensuring a minimum of 6 characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  Async validators (nameTakenValidator and emailTakenValidator) are implemented to call the API service methods isName and isEmail, validating against name/email already in use.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The provided template for the form group applies ngClass to conditionally add 'has-error' or 'has-success' based on whether the control is touched and invalid or valid, respectively.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  On submit, the SignupComponent dispatches AuthActions.signup with the form values, and the ApiService and associated AuthEffects handle sending the request and processing responses.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  Error feedback is implemented in the form-group template using a span element that pipes control.errors through the ErrorMessagePipe, displaying the appropriate error messages.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  In ngOnInit, the component sets the title using this.title.setTitle('Signup | PodBaby'), ensuring the page title is updated.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The component dispatches actions from AuthActions, and the module includes NgRx Store and Effects configuration (authReducer and AuthEffects) for handling state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button is disabled using [disabled]="form.pending || form.invalid", ensuring it remains disabled during pending submission.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  The AuthEffects signup$ effect uses map for a successful response and catchError to dispatch a signupFailed action, appropriately handling both cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component uses ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush, leverages Angular’s reactive forms and dependency injection, and appropriately manages its lifecycle in ngOnInit.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The ApiService reliably uses Angular’s HttpClient to perform GET and POST requests for interacting with the backend API.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The ErrorMessagePipe provides clear error messages that match the validation rules (e.g., handling 'required', 'nameLength', 'email', 'passwordLength', 'nameTaken', and 'emailTaken' errors) as expected.
