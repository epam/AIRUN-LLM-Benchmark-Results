# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The provided code explicitly mentions Angular 14 in the opening statement, and the code structure, syntax, and imports are consistent with Angular 14. The implementation includes modules, components, services, and directives specific to Angular 14.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
  
  The code clearly implements NgRx store for state management with proper imports from '@ngrx/store' throughout the application. The implementation includes a store module configuration in app.module.ts and feature store configuration in todos.module.ts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
  
  The code includes a properly implemented TodosEffects class that handles side effects such as loading data from localStorage and persisting changes. Effects are registered in the module configuration with EffectsModule.forRoot([]) and EffectsModule.forFeature([TodosEffects]).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
  
  The implementation includes well-structured actions (todos.actions.ts), reducers (todos.reducer.ts), and selectors (todos.selectors.ts) following NgRx patterns. Actions cover all required operations (add, toggle, save, delete, etc.), reducers handle state updates immutably, and selectors properly derive state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
  
  All components use the @Component decorator with proper configuration. Components like TodoItemComponent and TodoFooterComponent properly use @Input for receiving data and @Output with EventEmitter for communicating events to parent components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators
  
  React refs have been correctly replaced with Angular's @ViewChild decorator in components like TodoHeaderComponent and TodoItemComponent for accessing and manipulating DOM elements.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
  
  The code demonstrates proper component communication patterns with @Input() decorators for passing data down to child components and @Output() EventEmitter for sending events up to parent components, as seen in todo-item.component.ts and todo-footer.component.ts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
  
  The code includes the LocalStorageService for handling data persistence, following Angular's dependency injection patterns. The service is properly injected into the effects where it's needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
  
  Dependency injection is correctly implemented throughout the application. Services are provided with `providedIn: 'root'` and components inject services and store through constructor parameters.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
  
  Components use OnPush change detection strategy where appropriate, as seen in TodoAppComponent, TodoItemComponent, and TodoFooterComponent, which helps optimize performance by reducing unnecessary change detection cycles.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
  
  The code includes proper Angular Router implementation with route configuration in app-routing.module.ts. The routes match the requirements, including paths for filtering todos (all, active, completed).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code follows Angular style guide conventions with proper naming patterns, file organization, and module structure. Components, services, and features are organized in a logical directory structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
  
  TypeScript interfaces and types are properly used throughout the application, including Todo interface, Filter type, and strongly typed state interfaces in the NgRx store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
  
  All React JSX templates have been properly converted to Angular HTML template syntax with appropriate Angular directives (*ngIf, *ngFor, [property]="value", (event)="handler()").

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
  
  React event handlers have been properly replaced with Angular's event binding syntax using parentheses notation, such as (click), (change), (keydown), etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs
  
  The code has no remaining TODO comments and appears to be a complete implementation.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules
  
  While the code mentions that lazy loading is achievable by moving TodosModule to loadChildren in app-routing.module.ts, it doesn't actually implement lazy loading in the provided code. However, the author explicitly mentions this was left out for clarity but is fully compatible, so the implementation is prepared for lazy loading.
