# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items
  
  The `todo-app.component.html` contains a list structure that iterates through todos and renders them using the `todo-item` component. The component retrieves the todos from the store using `todos$ | async`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented
  
  The add functionality is present in the `todo-header.component.ts` which emits an event when Enter is pressed with a non-empty value, and the `todo-app.component.ts` dispatches the `addTodo` action in response.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works
  
  Toggle functionality is implemented in `todo-item.component.html` with an input checkbox that emits a toggle event, which is handled in `todo-app.component.ts` by dispatching the `toggleTodo` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented
  
  Editing is implemented in the `todo-item.component.ts` with methods for beginning edit mode, handling keyboard input, and submitting edits. The component emits a save event which is handled in the parent component by dispatching the `saveTodo` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented
  
  Delete functionality is available through the "destroy" button in `todo-item.component.html` which emits a destroy event, and `todo-app.component.ts` handles this by dispatching the `destroyTodo` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented
  
  The toggle-all functionality is implemented in `todo-app.component.html` with an input checkbox that triggers the `toggleAll` method, which dispatches the `toggleAll` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works
  
  Filtering is implemented using Angular Router with routes for '/', '/active', and '/completed'. The component listens to route changes and applies the appropriate filter using the selector `TodosSelectors.makeFiltered(filter)`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The footer component receives the active count as an input property and displays it with proper pluralization: `<strong>{{ active }}</strong> {{ active | pluralize:'item' }} left`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items
  
  The clear completed button is present in `todo-footer.component.html` and only displays when there are completed items. It emits an event that is handled in the parent component by dispatching the `clearCompleted` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage
  
  Persistence is handled by the `LocalStorageService` and the `TodosEffects` class, which loads todos from localStorage on initialization and saves todos to localStorage after every mutation action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation
  
  The application uses Angular Router with `useHash: true` to maintain the same URL structure as the original React application (#/, #/active, #/completed).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states
  
  The main section and footer are conditionally displayed only when todos exist: `*ngIf="(todos$ | async)?.length"`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly
  
  Form submissions are handled correctly in both adding new todos (preventing default behavior and clearing the input) and editing todos (handling blur events and various keyboard interactions).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships
  
  The application has a clear component hierarchy with parent-child relationships and proper communication through inputs and outputs. The component structure follows Angular best practices with feature modules and smart/presentational component separation.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved
  
  All business logic from the original application is preserved and implemented with NgRx for state management. This includes UUID generation, filtering, persistence, and all CRUD operations.
