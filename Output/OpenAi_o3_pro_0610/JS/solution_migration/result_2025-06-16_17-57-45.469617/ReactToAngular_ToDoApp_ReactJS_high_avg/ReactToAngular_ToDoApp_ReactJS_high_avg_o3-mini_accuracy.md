# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The provided instructions and configuration (e.g., Angular CLI 14+ command) clearly indicate an Angular 14 implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The code incorporates @ngrx/store in the TodosModule and AppModule, confirming its usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  The implementation of TodosEffects in the +state folder demonstrates the proper use of @ngrx/effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  The actions, reducers, and selectors are clearly defined and used appropriately in the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  Each component is correctly annotated with @Component, and properties/events are appropriately decorated with @Input and @Output.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  The React refs are swapped for Angularâ€™s @ViewChild in components like TodoHeaderComponent and TodoItemComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  The code demonstrates proper usage of @Input for input properties and @Output with EventEmitter for event propagation between components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  The LocalStorageService and the Utils class are used to encapsulate business logic and data handling, following Angular service patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  Dependency injection is used throughout (e.g., in constructors for services and the store) confirming proper implementation.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  Several components (e.g., TodoAppComponent, TodoItemComponent, TodoFooterComponent) use ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush. One or two components such as TodoHeaderComponent do not specify it, but this is acceptable if there's no mutable state.  
  Explanation: Although most components use OnPush, the omission in certain simple components is not necessarily an issue, yet it did reduce my confidence slightly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  The provided app-routing.module.ts uses Angular Router with route definitions and appropriate configurations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The directory structure, naming conventions, and code organization adhere to the Angular style guide.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  Interfaces (such as Todo) and types (such as Filter) are defined and are consistently used in the codebase.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  All the user interface templates are provided in Angular HTML format, with no remnants of JSX.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  The event handling is implemented using Angular's event binding syntax (e.g., (keydown), (click)) as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  A review of the code confirms that there are no remaining TODO comments.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  The code structure clearly separates the feature module (TodosModule); however, lazy loading is not implemented. Although the notes mention that lazy loading is achievable by moving TodosModule to loadChildren, the provided app-routing.module.ts directly imports and uses TodoAppComponent. This does not meet the step requirement for an implemented lazy loading mechanism.
