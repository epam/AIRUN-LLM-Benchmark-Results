# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The application uses an *ngFor loop in the todo-app component to display each todo item from the observable, ensuring that all items are rendered.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The todo-header component captures the ENTER key event and emits an add event, which the todo-app component intercepts to dispatch the addTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  The todo-item component emits a toggle event on checkbox change, which is handled by the todo-app component that dispatches toggleTodo. The reducer updates the completed state accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  The todo-item component provides an editing mode with key event handling (ENTER to submit, ESCAPE to cancel) and calls the save event. The parent component then dispatches the saveTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  The todo-item component emits a destroy event when the delete button is clicked, and the todo-app component dispatches destroyTodo, which results in the removal of the todo item in the reducer.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  A checkbox in todo-app (with id "toggle-all") calls the toggleAll method, dispatching the toggleAll action. This action updates every todo’s completed status accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  Route changes in the todo-app component update the current filter, and the makeFiltered selector in the state properly filters todos based on the provided criteria.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The footer component receives the active count (via a dedicated observable derived from the store) and correctly uses it to display the number of items left.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The todo-footer component provides a button that, when clicked, dispatches the clearCompleted action. The reducer then filters out completed todos accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  The LocalStorageService handles reading and writing of todos, and the TodosEffects include effects to load from and persist to localStorage after every mutation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The app-routing.module defines routes for '', 'active', and 'completed' using Angular’s RouterModule with useHash: true, matching the expected URL structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  The todo-app component conditionally renders the main section and footer only when todo items exist, which is consistent with the behavior of the original application for empty states.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  The todo-header component listens for keydown events on the input and processes submissions (dispatching addTodo) reliably upon detecting the ENTER key.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The application’s modules and component hierarchies (e.g., TodoAppComponent as the container with child components for header, item, and footer) are well-organized and adhere to Angular best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  All core functionalities from the original TodoMVC implementation are maintained with the introduction of @ngrx/store for state management and effects for side-effects, ensuring full behavioral parity.
