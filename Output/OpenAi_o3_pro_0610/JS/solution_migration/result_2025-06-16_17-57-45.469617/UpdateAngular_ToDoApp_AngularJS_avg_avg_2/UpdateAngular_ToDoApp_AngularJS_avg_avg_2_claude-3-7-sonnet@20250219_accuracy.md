# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The code explicitly references Angular 14 throughout, including in the setup instructions and component implementations. The NgModule imports and component decorators are consistent with Angular 14 syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS
  
  The code uses standard ES module imports throughout, with proper import/export syntax. For example: `import { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management
  
  The application properly implements @ngrx/store with a clear store configuration in the app.module.ts file: `StoreModule.forRoot({ todo: todoReducer })`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects
  
  @ngrx/effects is properly implemented with the TodoEffects class for handling side effects, particularly for loading and persisting todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management
  
  The implementation includes well-defined actions (todo.actions.ts), reducers (todo.reducer.ts), selectors (todo.selectors.ts), and effects (todo.effects.ts) for complete todo management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator
  
  The TodoStorageService correctly uses the @Injectable decorator with providedIn: 'root' for application-wide availability.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service
  
  The TodoStorageService properly implements localStorage for data persistence with get() and put() methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators
  
  All components (TodoAppComponent, HeaderComponent, ListComponent, ItemComponent, FooterComponent) use the @Component decorator with appropriate metadata.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators
  
  Both TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective use the @Directive decorator with appropriate selectors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)
  
  Templates correctly use Angular structural directives like *ngFor and *ngIf. For example: `<li *ngFor="let todo of todos" [ngClass]="{ completed: todo.completed }">`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))
  
  Event binding is correctly implemented throughout with Angular syntax. For example: `(click)="clearCompleted.emit()"`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])
  
  Property binding is correctly implemented, for example: `[ngClass]="{ completed: todo.completed }"`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed
  
  Lifecycle hooks are properly implemented, such as OnInit in TodoAppComponent and OnChanges in TodoFocusDirective.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models
  
  A proper TypeScript interface is defined for the Todo model with appropriate properties.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services
  
  Dependency injection is correctly implemented in components and services, such as injecting the Store and TodoStorageService where needed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code follows Angular style guide conventions with proper naming conventions, file organization, and component structure.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings
  
  The code appears well-structured without obvious issues that would cause console errors or warnings. However, without actually running the application, I cannot be 100% certain that there are no runtime errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)
  
  TypeScript features are used appropriately throughout the codebase, including interfaces, type annotations, and generics.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code
  
  The code appears clean without TODOs or commented-out code. The completed migration checklist explicitly states "no TODOs, Angular Style-Guide compliant."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design
  
  Components follow the single responsibility principle with clear separation of concerns. For example, the smart container component (TodoAppComponent) delegates to presentational components for specific parts of the UI.
