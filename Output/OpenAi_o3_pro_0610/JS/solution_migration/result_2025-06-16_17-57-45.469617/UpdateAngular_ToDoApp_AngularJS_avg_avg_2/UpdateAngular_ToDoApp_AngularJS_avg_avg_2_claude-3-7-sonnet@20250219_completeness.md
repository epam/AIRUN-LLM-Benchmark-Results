- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list
  
  The application has a `ListComponent` located in `src/app/components/list/list.component.ts` that handles displaying the todo list. It receives todos as an input and emits events for toggling, editing, and removing todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos
  
  The application has a `HeaderComponent` located in `src/app/components/header/header.component.ts` that provides an input field for adding new todos and emits an event when a new todo is submitted.

- **Fail** (95%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos
  
  The provided code does not include a specific component for filtering todos (All, Active, Completed). While the application has a footer component, it does not implement filtering functionality. The filter navigation usually seen in TodoMVC implementations is missing.

  The application implements functionality to add new todos through the `addTodo` action in the NgRx store and the `add` method in the `TodoAppComponent`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos
  
  The application implements functionality to edit existing todos through the `editTodo` action in the NgRx store and the `edit` method in the `TodoAppComponent`, which is triggered from the `ItemComponent`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos
  
  The application implements functionality to delete todos through the `removeTodo` action in the NgRx store and the `remove` method in the `TodoAppComponent`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed
  
  The application implements functionality to mark todos as completed through the `toggleTodo` action in the NgRx store and the `toggle` method in the `TodoAppComponent`.

- **Fail** (95%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The provided code does not include functionality to filter todos by their status (All, Active, Completed). This is typically a core feature of TodoMVC applications but is not implemented in the given code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete
  
  The application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete or incomplete through the `toggleAll` action in the NgRx store and the `toggleAll` method in the `TodoAppComponent`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos
  
  The application implements functionality to clear completed todos through the `clearCompleted` action in the NgRx store and the `clearCompleted` method in the `TodoAppComponent`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos
  
  The application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos through the `selectRemainingCount` selector and passes this information to the `FooterComponent`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage
  
  The application persists todos in localStorage through the `TodoStorageService` and the `persist$` effect in the `TodoEffects` class.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization
  
  The application loads persisted todos on initialization through the `loadTodos` action dispatched in the `ngOnInit` method of the `TodoAppComponent` and the `load$` effect in the `TodoEffects` class.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing
  
  The application handles escape key press to cancel editing through the `TodoEscapeDirective` which listens for the Escape key and emits an event, which is then handled by the `revert` method in the `ItemComponent`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo
  
  The application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo through the `TodoFocusDirective` which sets focus on the element when the input value changes to true.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original
  
  The application maintains the same visual appearance as the original by including the TodoMVC CSS files in the index.html and using the same class names and HTML structure as the original TodoMVC application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately
  
  The application handles empty todo titles appropriately by trimming input values and not adding empty todos. When editing, if the title becomes empty after trimming, the todo is removed.

- **Fail** (95%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter
