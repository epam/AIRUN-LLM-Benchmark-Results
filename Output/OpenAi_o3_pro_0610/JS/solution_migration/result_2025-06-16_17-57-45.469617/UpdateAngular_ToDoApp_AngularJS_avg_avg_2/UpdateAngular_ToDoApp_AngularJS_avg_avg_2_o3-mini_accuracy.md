# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The instructions explicitly state to create the project with Angular CLI (v14.x) and the code is tailored to Angular 14.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
  The code utilizes ES module imports/exports (e.g., import { Component } from '@angular/core'), which confirms the use of ES modules rather than RequireJS.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
  The implementation includes importing and setting up StoreModule with a defined todo reducer for state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
  The code sets up EffectsModule and defines TodoEffects to handle side effects such as localStorage persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
  The provided files define actions (todo.actions.ts), a reducer (todo.reducer.ts), selectors (todo.selectors.ts), and effects (todo.effects.ts) necessary for the todo management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
  The TodoStorageService is correctly decorated with @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }), ensuring proper injection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
  The TodoStorageService clearly uses localStorage to get and put the todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
  All components (e.g., TodoAppComponent, HeaderComponent, ListComponent, ItemComponent, FooterComponent) are defined with the @Component decorator.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
  Both custom directives (TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective) are defined with the @Directive decorator.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
  The component templates contain usage of Angular directives like *ngFor and *ngIf, validating proper Angular template syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
  Event binding such as (click) and (ngSubmit) is used correctly in the templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
  Property bindings are correctly implemented (e.g., [ngClass]="{ completed: todo.completed }", [checked]="allCompleted$ | async").

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
  Lifecycle hooks like ngOnInit in TodoAppComponent and ngOnChanges in TodoFocusDirective are correctly used.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
  The Todo model is clearly defined as a TypeScript interface in todo.model.ts.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
  Components and services use Angularâ€™s dependency injection mechanism via constructor parameters.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The structure, naming, and coding styles observed across modules, components, services, and directives adhere to common Angular best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
  There are no indications of console errors or warnings; the migration steps and clean code suggest a well-configured Angular project.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
  The provided code makes good use of TypeScript with proper typing, interfaces, and decorators consistent with modern Angular practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
  The code is free of any leftover TODO comments or excessive commented-out code, aside from minor inline comments explaining behaviors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design  
  The application separates concerns into distinct files and components (smart container, header, list, item, footer), each handling specific responsibilities.
