# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list  
  The code includes a ListComponent (and an ItemComponent nested within it) that renders the list of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos  
  The HeaderComponent is responsible for adding new todos via an input field and emits an add event.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos  
  The ItemComponent implements editing functionality through methods (startEdit, doneEdit, revert) that allow modification of a todo.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos  
  There is no dedicated component or visible UI element in the provided code that handles filtering todos into categories (e.g., All, Active, Completed).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics  
  The FooterComponent displays counts (remaining and done) of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos  
  The HeaderComponent and the corresponding addTodo action in the NgRx store handle adding todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos  
  The ItemComponent allows editing of todo titles and dispatches an editTodo action upon changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos  
  Removal is handled by the ItemComponent emitting a remove event, which dispatches a removeTodo action in the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed  
  The checkbox and toggle mechanism in both ItemComponent and the NgRx store (toggleTodo action) ensure that todos can be marked completed.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)  
  Although the checklist expects filtering functionality, there is no implementation (e.g., filter buttons or URL-based filters) present in the provided code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete  
  The TodoAppComponent includes the toggleAll function and an associated checkbox to mark all todos as complete or incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos  
  The FooterComponent shows a clear-completed button and dispatches the clearCompleted action to remove completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos  
  The FooterComponent displays the count of remaining (active) todos using the remainingCount selector.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage  
  The TodoStorageService saves todos to localStorage using JSON serialization; it is integrated via an NgRx effect (persist$).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization  
  The loadTodos effect in TodoEffects retrieves persisted todos from localStorage when the application initializes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing  
  The TodoEscapeDirective listens for the Escape key press and emits an event to cancel editing in the ItemComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo  
  The TodoFocusDirective is used with the editing input in the ItemComponent to automatically focus the input when it becomes visible.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original  
  The provided code includes the TodoMVC CSS files and structures the HTML similarly to the original version; however, without live rendering, the appearance match is assumed based on the file inclusion and structural alignment.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately  
  Both the HeaderComponent and ItemComponent trim the input: if the todo title is empty, no new todo is added or an existing todo is removed accordingly.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter  
  There is no implementation evident in the provided code that handles URL changes to reflect the current filter (All, Active, Completed).
