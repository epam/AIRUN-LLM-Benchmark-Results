# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed
  
  The code includes a Header component with a keyDown event handler that checks for the ENTER_KEY and dispatches the addTodo action when the key is pressed and there's a non-empty value.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter
  
  The TodoList component includes filtering logic in the useMemo hook that filters todos based on the current filter state (all, active, completed).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos
  
  There is a toggleAll action in the Redux slice and corresponding UI in the TodoList component with an input checkbox that dispatches this action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted
  
  The TodoItem component includes functionality for toggling (onToggle), editing (onEdit), and deleting (onDestroy) todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode
  
  The TodoItem component has a label with an onDoubleClick handler that calls the onEdit function, which dispatches the startEdit action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo
  
  The TodoItem component includes an onKeyDown handler that checks for the ENTER_KEY and calls the submit function, which dispatches the saveTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value
  
  The TodoItem component's onKeyDown handler checks for the ESCAPE_KEY and dispatches the cancelEdit action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The Footer component calculates activeCount and displays it with proper pluralization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The Footer component includes links for All, Active, and Completed filters that dispatch the setFilter action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos
  
  The Footer component includes a "Clear completed" button that dispatches the clearCompleted action when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence
  
  The code includes a persistence middleware that saves todos to localStorage after each action, and a load function that retrieves todos from localStorage on initialization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state
  
  Multiple components conditionally render based on state: TodoList and Footer only render if there are todos, the "Clear completed" button only shows if there are completed todos, etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count
  
  The Footer component uses a Utils.pluralize function to correctly pluralize "item" based on the activeCount.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components
  
  The application is broken down into smaller, focused components: Header, TodoList, TodoItem, and Footer, each with specific responsibilities.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality
  
  The project structure is organized by feature, with a "todos" feature containing related components, a slice file for state management, and constants/utils files.
