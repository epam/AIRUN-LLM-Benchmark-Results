# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The Header component uses an onKeyDown event handler that checks for the ENTER_KEY and dispatches the addTodo action accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The TodoList component filters todos based on the current filter value using useMemo and then renders the appropriate TodoItem components.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  The TodoList component includes a checkbox input that calls the toggleAll action when its value changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  The TodoItem component provides handlers to toggle the todo’s completion status, enter the edit mode (via double-click), and delete the todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  The TodoItem component attaches an onDoubleClick handler on the label that triggers the startEdit action, switching the todo into editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  In the editing mode of TodoItem, the onKeyDown handler checks for ENTER_KEY and triggers submission of the updated todo text.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  The TodoItem component’s onKeyDown handler listens for the ESCAPE_KEY and dispatches cancelEdit to exit editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  The Footer component calculates the activeCount (total todos minus completed todos) and displays it correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The Footer component contains links that dispatch setFilter with 'all', 'active', or 'completed' as required.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  The Footer component conditionally renders a clear-completed button when there are completed todos and attaches the clearCompleted action to it.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  The persistence middleware in the Redux store config writes updates to localStorage, and the initial state is loaded from localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  UI elements such as the TodoList and the clear-completed button are conditionally rendered based on the state of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  The Footer displays the active item count using Utils.pluralize, which correctly pluralizes the word "item" based on the count.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The application is split into Header, TodoList, TodoItem, and Footer components, each handling a specific responsibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The project structure shows a file-per-feature approach under the src/features/todos directory.
