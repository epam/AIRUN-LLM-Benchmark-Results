# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration
  
  The code shows clear usage of Create React App with TypeScript template (`npx create-react-app virtual-piano --template typescript`). React 18 features are evident through the use of `ReactDOM.createRoot()` in index.tsx, which is specific to React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure
  
  TypeScript interfaces are properly defined in the `src/types/notes.ts` file, with clear type definitions for `Note` and `SoundMap` interface.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks
  
  All components (App, Piano, PianoKey, ToggleButtons, FullscreenButton) are implemented as functional components with appropriate React hooks (useState, useCallback, useEffect, useMemo).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)
  
  The application correctly uses React hooks for state management:
  - `useState` for mode selection, active notes tracking
  - `useEffect` for keyboard event handling
  - `useCallback` for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels
  
  Keyboard event handlers are correctly implemented at the App component level using useEffect to add and remove event listeners for 'keydown' and 'keyup' events.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions are implemented using React synthetic events
  
  Mouse (pointer) interactions are implemented using React's synthetic events in the PianoKey component:
  - `onPointerDown`, `onPointerUp`, `onPointerLeave`, and `onPointerEnter` instead of traditional mouse events, which is a modern approach that handles both mouse and touch interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment
  
  Audio resources are properly handled with the `makeAudio` function that creates Audio objects outside of component rendering, preventing re-creation on re-renders. The function also correctly uses the public URL path to access audio files.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility
  
  The FullscreenButton component correctly uses React patterns (useState, useCallback) and handles browser compatibility by including both standard and webkit-prefixed fullscreen methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns
  
  Conditional class application follows React patterns throughout the application:
  - Using template literals with conditionals (`${mode === 'notes' ? 'btn-active' : ''}`)
  - Using array filtering for class combinations (`[...].filter(Boolean).join(' ')`)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate
  
  All presentational components (Piano, PianoKey, ToggleButtons, FullscreenButton) are wrapped with React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations
  
  Audio playback is properly handled with regard to React lifecycle. Audio objects are created once outside of the component, and playback is managed via callbacks that are properly memoized with useCallback.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application
  
  The code follows strict TypeScript typing throughout:
  - Proper type definitions for all component props
  - Type definitions for states (Mode, Note, SoundMap)
  - Proper typing of event handlers and callbacks
  - Type extensions for Document interface to handle webkit-specific methods
