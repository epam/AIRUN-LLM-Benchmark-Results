# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration  
  The answer shows that the project is bootstrapped with “npx create-react-app … --template typescript” and uses ReactDOM.createRoot (introduced in React 18). This confirms both React 18 and the CRA TypeScript configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure  
  The code defines the type Note and the interface SoundMap in src/types/notes.ts which ensures that audio resources are mapped with strict typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks  
  All components (App, ToggleButtons, Piano, PianoKey, FullscreenButton) are implemented as functional components and make use of React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback) as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)  
  The application maintains state using useState (for mode and active notes) and manages side effects (global keyboard event handling) with useEffect, ensuring robust UI interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels  
  Global keyboard event handlers for keydown and keyup are registered in the App component via useEffect, appropriately handling the user’s key interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events  
  The PianoKey component uses pointer events (onPointerDown, onPointerUp, onPointerLeave, onPointerEnter) which are part of React’s synthetic event system and correctly capture mouse (as well as touch/pen) interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment  
  Audio objects are created only once outside of render using a dedicated makeAudio function, and proper controls (resetting currentTime and invoking play) ensure they are managed efficiently in the React environment.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility  
  The FullscreenButton component is implemented as a functional component, uses useCallback for the toggle logic, and handles browser compatibility by checking for webkit-prefixed fullscreen properties.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns  
  Conditional classes (e.g., adding active or sharp classes) are applied using JavaScript expressions and array filtering in components like PianoKey and ToggleButtons, following standard React practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate  
  Components such as ToggleButtons, Piano, PianoKey, and FullscreenButton are memoized with React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations  
  The play and stop functions are wrapped in useCallback and properly manage state updates, while global event handlers are set up and torn down correctly with useEffect, ensuring that audio playback is in sync with the component lifecycle.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application  
  The code makes good use of TypeScript types and interfaces across the application (e.g., defining props for components, type-checking keyboard event handlers, and using explicit type definitions for audio mapping).
