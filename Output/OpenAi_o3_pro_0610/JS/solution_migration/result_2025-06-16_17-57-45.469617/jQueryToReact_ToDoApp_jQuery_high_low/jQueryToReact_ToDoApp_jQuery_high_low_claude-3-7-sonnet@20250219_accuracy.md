# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18.x
  
  The code clearly shows React 18 usage with ReactDOM.createRoot in src/index.tsx which is specific to React 18's concurrent rendering features. It also imports from 'react-dom/client', confirming React 18 usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript for type safety
  
  TypeScript is used throughout the codebase with proper type annotations, interfaces, and type declarations. Files have .ts and .tsx extensions, and there are explicit type definitions for Todo, Filter, and other interfaces.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for state management
  
  The code uses Redux Toolkit's createSlice in todosSlice.ts to define reducers and actions. The slice properly defines actions like addTodo, toggleTodo, etc., using modern Redux Toolkit patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm nanoid is used for generating unique IDs
  
  The code imports nanoid from 'nanoid' package and uses it in the prepare callback of the addTodo reducer to generate unique IDs for new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code uses functional components with hooks instead of class components
  
  All components are implemented as functional components using React hooks such as useState, useEffect, useRef, and custom hooks like useAppDispatch and useAppSelector.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains the same routing functionality with proper route handling
  
  The application uses react-router-dom v6 with HashRouter to maintain the same hash-based routing as the original jQuery application. Routes for /all, /active, and /completed are properly defined, and NavLink is used to highlight active routes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Redux store is properly configured with appropriate slices
  
  The store is configured in store.ts using configureStore from Redux Toolkit, with the todos reducer properly registered. The store also includes a subscription to persist state to localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the Redux provider is set up in the application entry point
  
  The Redux Provider is correctly set up in index.tsx, wrapping the App component and providing the store to the entire application.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for all data structures
  
  The code includes proper TypeScript interfaces and types for all data structures, including Todo, Filter, TodosState, RootState, and AppDispatch.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows React best practices for component composition
  
  The code follows React best practices with well-structured, focused components like Header, TodoList, TodoItem, ToggleAll, and Footer. Each component has a single responsibility and uses proper prop typing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles keyboard events properly
  
  Keyboard events are properly handled, including Enter key for creating and updating todos, and Escape key for canceling edits. These are implemented in the Header and TodoItem components using onKeyUp event handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application maintains local storage persistence
  
  Local storage persistence is implemented using a store.subscribe callback that saves todos to localStorage when state changes, and the loadTodos utility is used to restore state on application startup.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  The code appears to be free of potential console errors and warnings based on the implementation. However, without running the application, we can't verify with 100% certainty that no runtime errors would occur.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the application implements proper error handling
  
  The code includes basic error handling for localStorage operations using try/catch blocks. However, there's limited error handling for other potential issues, such as network failures or unexpected state transitions.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm the code is optimized with no unnecessary re-renders
  
  The code appears optimized with proper use of Redux selectors to avoid unnecessary re-renders. Components only select the specific state they need. However, without profiling the running application, we can't be 100% certain there are no unnecessary re-renders in edge cases.
