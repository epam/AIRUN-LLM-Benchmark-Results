# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos
  
  The Header component clearly implements a title "todos" and an input field with the class "new-todo" that allows creating new todos with proper placeholder text "What needs to be done?".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos
  
  The code includes a main section with id "main" that contains both the ToggleAll component (with a toggle-all checkbox) and the TodoList component that renders the list of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button
  
  The TodoItem component correctly implements all three elements: a checkbox with class "toggle", a label displaying the todo title, and a delete button with class "destroy".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode
  
  In the TodoItem component, the label has an onDoubleClick handler that calls handleEdit(), which sets the editing state to true, enabling the editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The application implements filtering through React Router with routes for "/all", "/active", and "/completed". The Footer component contains NavLinks for these filters, and the TodoList uses selectFilteredTodos to display the appropriate todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization
  
  The Footer component displays the active count with proper pluralization using the pluralize helper function: `<strong>{activeCount}</strong> {pluralize(activeCount, 'item')} left`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter
  
  The Footer component includes NavLinks with a className function that applies the "selected" class when the link is active, highlighting the current filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist
  
  The Footer component conditionally renders the clear-completed button only when completedCount > 0.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter
  
  The Header component implements an onKeyUp handler that checks for the Enter key and dispatches the addTodo action when pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos
  
  The TodoItem component includes a checkbox with an onChange handler that dispatches the toggleTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once
  
  The ToggleAll component implements this functionality with a checkbox that dispatches the toggleAll action when changed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management
  
  The TodoItem component uses useEffect and useRef to focus the input field and position the cursor at the end of the text when editing mode is activated.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos
  
  Each TodoItem includes a destroy button that dispatches the deleteTodo action when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos
  
  The Footer component includes a "Clear completed" button that dispatches the clearCompleted action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status
  
  The selectFilteredTodos selector in selectors.ts properly filters todos based on the current filter state (all, active, or completed).
