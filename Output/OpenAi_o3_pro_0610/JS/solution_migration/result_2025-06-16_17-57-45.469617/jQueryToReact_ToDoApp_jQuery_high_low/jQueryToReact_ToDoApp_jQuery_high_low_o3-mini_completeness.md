- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos  
  The Header component contains an <h1> element with the title “todos” and an <input> element (with id "new-todo") for entering new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos  
  The main section in TodoMvcPage includes both the <ToggleAll /> and <TodoList /> components, ensuring a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos are present.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button  
  Each TodoItem component renders a checkbox (class "toggle"), a label displaying the todo title, and a destroy button for deletion.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode  
  The TodoItem component contains a label with an onDoubleClick event handler that triggers editing mode (setting state “editing” to true).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  Filtering is implemented via routing and the Footer component’s NavLink components, which allow the user to switch between "All", "Active", and "Completed" views.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization  
  The Footer component displays the active count using <strong> and uses the helper function pluralize to correctly pluralize “item” versus “items.”

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter  
  The NavLink components in Footer automatically apply the “selected” class based on the route, highlighting the current filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist  
  The Footer conditionally renders the “Clear completed” button if the completed todos count is more than zero.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter  
  In the Header component, the input field listens for the Enter key (via the handleKeyUp event) and dispatches an action to add a new todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos  
  The TodoItem component’s checkbox is wired to dispatch a toggle action (toggleTodo) that updates the completion status.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once  
  The ToggleAll component provides a checkbox that dispatches the toggleAll action to mark all todos as either complete or incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management  
  The TodoItem component manages editing mode, and its input field automatically receives focus with correct cursor positioning when editing starts.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos  
  The TodoItem component contains a button (class "destroy") that dispatches the deleteTodo action to remove the todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos  
  The Footer component provides a "Clear completed" button that dispatches the clearCompleted action to delete all completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status  
  The selectors in the code filter todos based on the current filter value (active, completed, or all), ensuring the correct set of todos is displayed.
