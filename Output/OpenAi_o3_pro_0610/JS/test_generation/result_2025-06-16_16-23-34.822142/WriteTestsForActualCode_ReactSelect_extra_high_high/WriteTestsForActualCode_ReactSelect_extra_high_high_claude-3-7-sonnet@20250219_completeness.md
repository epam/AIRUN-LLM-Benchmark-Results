# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist
  
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present
  
- **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values
  
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented
  
- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility
  
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested
  
- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states
  
  The provided test strategy does not include specific tests for loading states or error states. The document doesn't mention any tests that verify behavior when `isLoading` is true or when there are error conditions to be handled by the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states
  
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance
  
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested
  
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering
  
- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations
  
  The test strategy does not include any tests for custom `formatOptionLabel` implementations. This is an important customization feature for the Select component that allows users to control how options are rendered, but no tests are provided to verify this functionality works correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)
  
- **Fail** (90%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)
  
  While there is a test for the clear indicator ("clear indicator removes value and focuses input"), I don't see specific tests for dropdown indicators or loading indicators. The test strategy mentions testing for clear indicators but is missing explicit tests for the other indicator components.
