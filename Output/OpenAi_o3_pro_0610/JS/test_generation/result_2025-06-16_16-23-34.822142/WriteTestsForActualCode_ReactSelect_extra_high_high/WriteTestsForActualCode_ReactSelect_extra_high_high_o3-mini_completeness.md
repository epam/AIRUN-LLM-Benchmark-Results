# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist  
  The test suite includes a "Select – basic rendering" section that verifies the presence of a placeholder and input with correct ARIA attributes.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present  
  The tests verify keyboard operations such as arrow key navigation, Enter key selection, Escape key for closing the menu, and a full keyboard loop via tabbing.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)  
  The suite contains tests for clicking to open the menu, selecting options, and hovering over options to trigger visual focus changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior  
  There are dedicated tests for verifying controlled behavior (with a set value and onChange callback) and for uncontrolled scenarios.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values  
  Tests such as those verifying the clear indicator functionality and multi-select removals confirm state management when values are modified.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented  
  The test scenarios explicitly check for menu opening (via click or focus) and proper menu closing (e.g., after selection or pressing Escape).

- **Pass** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality  
  The provided test for "filters options as the user types" ensures that the filtering mechanism is verified.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist  
  The suite includes a test that checks for multi-select capability, verifying that multiple options can be selected and deselected without closing the menu.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility  
  ARIA attributes are directly tested (e.g., in the basic rendering and live-region tests) to ensure accessibility compliance.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested  
  There is a test that verifies the display of a “No options” message when the options array is empty.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states  
  The test suite does not include any tests that simulate or verify loading indicators or error state handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states  
  A specific test confirms that clicks on disabled options are ignored, ensuring disabled state behavior is handled correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance  
  The performance test that checks the rendering of 1000 options under 50 ms meets this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested  
  Tests (e.g., after clearing a selection) verify that focus management is handled appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering  
  The presence of placeholder text and rendering of selected values are confirmed in the basic rendering and controlled component tests.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations  
  There are no tests provided that cover custom implementations of formatOptionLabel.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)  
  The test suite explicitly tests the behavior of these callback functions, ensuring they are triggered appropriately on user interactions.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)  
  While there is a test for the clear indicator, there are no explicit tests covering dropdown indicators or loading indicator components.
