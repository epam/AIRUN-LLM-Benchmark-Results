# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources
  
  The REST factory tests in `rest.factory.spec.js` validate that all expected resources are exposed and that each resource has the necessary CRUD methods (get, query, save, delete, update).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly
  
  The tests in `factories.spec.js` verify that the Page factory initializes with correct defaults and validates its singleton nature by checking persistence across injections.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly
  
  The tests in `factories.spec.js` verify that the Users factory initializes with correct defaults and validates persistence across injections.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods
  
  The `pageCtrl.spec.js` file contains comprehensive tests for the controller's public methods, including titleChange, descriptionChange, urlChange, saveLocal, localVersion, deleteNewerVersion, autocompleteTags, selectSuggestion, updatePageType, deletePage, and savePage.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller
  
  The tests explicitly verify initialization logic with statements like "initialises $scope.page from Page factory" and "auto-selects first theme page when none was set".

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation
  
  The tests for titleChange verify that it generates a slug when URL is "/new" and that it doesn't overwrite custom URLs.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction
  
  The tests verify that saveLocal persists data to localStorage by checking that the correct localStorage.setItem calls are made with the expected values.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality
  
  Tests for autocompleteTags verify that it queries REST when there is a last tag and clears suggestions when the last tag is falsy.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)
  
  The tests for savePage cover different branches including validation failures (duplicate URL, missing page type, empty URL) and successful creation of a new page.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types
  
  The tests specifically cover edge cases such as empty URLs and missing page types in the savePage validation branches.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly
  
  The test for deletePage verifies that it hits all the necessary endpoints (content, contentRevisions, contentRevisionsExtras) and redirects to "/new".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions
  
  The tests for localVersion and deleteNewerVersion verify proper handling of page versions and localStorage interactions, including clearing flags and broadcasting events.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components
  
  The coverage results show that the tests achieve above 80% coverage for statements (92.32%), branches (90.11%), functions (88.42%), and lines (92.17%), exceeding the required 80% threshold defined in the karma configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling
  
  The tests verify event broadcasting by spying on $rootScope.$broadcast and checking that it's called with the correct parameters in various methods like localVersion, updatePageType, and savePage error handling.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality
  
  While the tests verify that the schedule date is initialized as a Date object, detailed testing of date handling and scheduling functionality is not as extensive as other areas. The test checks that `$scope.page.scheduleDate instanceof Date` is true, but doesn't test manipulation of dates or scheduling logic in depth.
