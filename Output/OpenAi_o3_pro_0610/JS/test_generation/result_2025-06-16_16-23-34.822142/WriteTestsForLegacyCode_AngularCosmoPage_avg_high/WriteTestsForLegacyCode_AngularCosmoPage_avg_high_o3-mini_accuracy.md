# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)  
  The test suite uses Jasmine for writing the tests and Karma as the test runner, which are modern and widely used tools in the JavaScript ecosystem.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints  
  The tests use AngularJS’s dependency injection and mocks (e.g., REST factory is stubbed with spy-enabled dummy functions) to simulate REST endpoints. This ensures that network calls or actual API requests are not made.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation  
  The tests make consistent use of beforeEach to set up modules and inject dependencies (e.g., creating a new $scope for each controller test). This provides a clean environment for each test execution.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls  
  Although no explicit $httpBackend usage is seen, the tests use Angular’s mocks and the REST factory is replaced with dummy functions (via spies) ensuring that no real HTTP requests are triggered.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection  
  Dependencies such as $controller, $rootScope, Page, REST, and $location are injected through AngularJS’s DI mechanism during test setup, ensuring that all required components are available.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations  
  The $translate mock, for instance, returns a promise that is immediately resolved to avoid asynchronous timing issues. While the test suite handles promise resolution within the mocks, testing asynchronous behavior isn’t extensively showcased, but the setup demonstrates proper handling.  
  (Explanation: Although promise usage is limited to the $translate mock, the approach is sound and matches the intended purpose.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies  
  Spies are effectively used (e.g., spyOn for localStorage methods, $rootScope.$broadcast, and REST CRUD operations) to simulate and verify behavior without reliance on external implementations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization  
  The tests are well-organized using nested describe blocks and individual it cases, clearly grouping related tests and scenarios.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls  
  There are tests for error conditions (e.g., rejecting duplicate URLs, missing page type, empty URL) as well as successful operations (e.g., saving a valid page, deleting a page), ensuring comprehensive coverage.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate  
  The tests mimic user interactions (e.g., updating form fields, triggering functions like titleChange, urlChange, savePage) by directly manipulating $scope properties, simulating the model updates expected from user actions.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage  
  Each test initializes its own $scope and dependencies in a well-contained beforeEach block, helping to prevent state leakage between tests.  
  (Explanation: While explicit afterEach blocks for cleanup aren’t present, AngularJS testing conventions with beforeEach setup generally ensure proper isolation.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested  
  The test names (e.g., "Page – defaults are correct and are singletons", "deletePage() hits all endpoints and redirects to /new") are descriptive and clearly articulate the expectations and behavior being verified.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible  
  The tests focus on verifying observable outcomes (such as changes to scope values, $broadcast calls, and correct invocation of REST operations) instead of tightly coupling the tests to internal implementation details.
