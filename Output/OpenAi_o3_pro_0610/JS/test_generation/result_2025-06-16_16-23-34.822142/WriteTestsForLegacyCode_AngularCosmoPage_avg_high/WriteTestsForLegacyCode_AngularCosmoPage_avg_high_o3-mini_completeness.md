# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources  
  All defined REST resources are tested in "test/rest.factory.spec.js" and each exposes CRUD methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly  
  The Page factory is tested in "test/factories.spec.js" for both default values and persistence across injections.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly  
  The Users factory is similarly verified in "test/factories.spec.js" for default properties and for persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods  
  The "test/pageCtrl.spec.js" suite extensively covers all public methods of the controller, including various helper functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller  
  The controller initialization is confirmed with tests that check the proper setting of $scope.page from the Page factory.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation  
  The test for titleChange explicitly verifies that a proper slug is generated and that a custom URL remains unchanged.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction  
  The saveLocal functionality is covered by tests confirming that localStorage.setItem is called with the expected arguments.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality  
  The tests check that REST is queried when appropriate, and that suggestions are properly cleared when no valid tag exists.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)  
  Multiple branches of the savePage function are tested, including duplicate URLs, missing page types, and the happy path.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types  
  The edge cases, such as empty URL and missing page type, are explicitly tested in the savePage validation branches.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly  
  There is a dedicated test verifying that deletePage calls all expected REST endpoints and updates the URL as intended.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions  
  Both localVersion() and deleteNewerVersion() tests validate the correct handling of stored values and flag clearing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components  
  Coverage results show over 90% for statements, branches, and lines, which exceeds the target.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling  
  The tests check for the broadcasting of events such as 'notify', 'contentGet', and 'settingsGet', confirming proper event handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality  
  The initialization tests confirm that scheduleDate is properly instantiated as a Date, ensuring correct scheduling functionality.
