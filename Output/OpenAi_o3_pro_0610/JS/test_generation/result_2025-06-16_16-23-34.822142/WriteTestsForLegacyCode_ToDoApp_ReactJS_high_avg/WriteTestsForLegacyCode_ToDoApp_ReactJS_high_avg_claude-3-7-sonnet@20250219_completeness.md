# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering
- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos
- **Fail** (90%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos

    The app.integration.test.tsx file includes tests for creating todos and clearing completed todos, but there is no explicit test for toggling all todos. The test suite tests toggling individual todos (via `.toggle` click), but not the "toggle all" functionality that would be triggered by a `.toggle-all` element.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos

    The app.integration.test.tsx file does not include tests for filtering todos. There are no tests that verify the behavior when different filters (All, Active, Completed) are selected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events
- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts
- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation
- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions
- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations
- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data
- **Fail** (80%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented

    While the code provides a Router mock in the jest.setup.ts file (`(global as any).Router = jest.fn()`), the integration tests in app.integration.test.tsx don't explicitly test routing functionality. There is no test that verifies different routes (e.g., #/active, #/completed) render the correct filtered todo lists. The footer test checks if the correct link is highlighted based on the nowShowing prop, but doesn't test actual routing behavior.
