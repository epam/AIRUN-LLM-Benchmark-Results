# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering  
  The integration test file (app.integration.test.tsx) mounts the TodoApp and checks for elements like the input box and todo label, which indirectly confirms component rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos  
  The "user can create a todo via the input box" test in the integration suite confirms that adding new todos is tested.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos  
  No test within the integration test file (app.integration.test.tsx) specifically verifies the toggling of all todos. Although the TodoModel tests the toggleAll functionality, the integration tests do not cover toggling all todos at the app level.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos  
  The provided integration tests do not include any test that checks for filtering todos (e.g. showing active vs. completed). The filtering behavior appears only indirectly referenced in the footer tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The integration test "completed todo can be cleared with footer button" confirms that clearing completed todos is tested at the app level.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering  
  The todoItem.test.tsx file includes a test ("renders title and unchecked box") that confirms the component renders as expected.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos  
  There are separate tests for toggling (clicking the checkbox), destroying (clicking the destroy button), and beginning an edit (double-clicking the label), confirming these actions are properly tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events  
  The tests for the ENTER key (saving edited text) and ESCAPE key (cancelling edit) verify proper handling of keyboard events.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts  
  The footer test ("renders count with correct pluralization") confirms that the component renders the count correctly based on different values.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation  
  The test "highlights the currently selected filter" in footer.test.tsx validates the navigation behavior based on the current filter.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The footer tests include cases to show and trigger the "clear completed" button as well as omitting it when there are no completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos  
  The TodoModel tests comprehensively cover addTodo, toggle, save, and destroy methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions  
  The "onChanges subscribers are notified" test verifies that subscription notifications are handled.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The TodoModel test "clearCompleted removes completed todos" explicitly checks this functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation  
  The tests in utils.test.ts confirm that the uuid function generates a 36-character uuid with dashes and that sequential calls produce unique values.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality  
  The test for pluralize in utils.test.ts ensures correct handling of singular and plural cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations  
  The tests check that Utils.store persists and retrieves data correctly and returns an empty array when no data is stored.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function  
  The extend function is tested by confirming a shallow merge behavior across multiple objects.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx  
  The naming convention is followed. Tests for React components use .test.tsx while non-React tests use .test.ts. The instruction "[filename].test.ts[x]" accommodates both extensions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data  
  Test fixtures are provided, e.g. the helper function makeTodo in todoItem.test.tsx creates sample todo data for testing.

- **Fail** (95%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented  
  Although a global Router is mocked in jest.setup.ts and footer tests check filter state via nowShowing props, there is no explicit test that verifies routing functionality (e.g. navigation changes or URL updates). This leaves some uncertainty in whether full routing functionality is properly validated.
