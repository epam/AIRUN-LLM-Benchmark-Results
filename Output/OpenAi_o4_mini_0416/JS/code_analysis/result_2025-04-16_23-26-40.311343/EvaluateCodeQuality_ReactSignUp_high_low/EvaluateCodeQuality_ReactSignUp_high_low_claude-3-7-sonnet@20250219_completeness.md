  State management for form data is properly analyzed:
  - Section 4.1 addresses migration from redux-form v5 to newer state management solutions
  - Section 4.2 discusses separating container vs presentational components for better state management
  - The entire analysis acknowledges redux-form as the state management solution and provides improvements

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm component structure and responsibilities are evaluated
  
  Component structure and responsibilities are evaluated:
  - Section 4.2 specifically addresses splitting container vs. presentational components
  - Section 3.1 suggests a FormGroup component structure for better organization of form fields
  - Section 1.4 discusses component method binding strategy

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure prop usage and component interfaces are reviewed
  
  Prop usage and component interfaces are reviewed:
  - Section 4.3 specifically addresses correct PropTypes for children
  - Section 1.1 addresses the deprecated PropTypes import
  - Section 3.1 discusses proper prop usage for accessibility

- **Pass** (100%): Verify component lifecycle management is analyzed
  
  Component lifecycle management is analyzed:
  - Section 1.4 discusses proper method binding to avoid issues in component lifecycle
  - Section 2.1 addresses proper handling of promises in component methods
  - Section 2.2 addresses event handling to prevent duplicate execution during render cycle

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm API call patterns and error handling are evaluated
  
  API call patterns and error handling are evaluated:
  - Section 6.1 specifically addresses API integration with async/await and error handling
  - Section 2.1 discusses unnecessary Promise wrapper in API calls
  - Section 2.3 recommends debouncing API calls during validation

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure promise handling and asynchronous operations are assessed
  
  Promise handling and asynchronous operations are thoroughly assessed:
  - Section 2.1 specifically addresses unnecessary Promise wrapper
  - Section 6.1 recommends using async/await for better promise handling
  - Section 1.3 discusses structuring asynchronous validation better

- **Pass** (100%): Verify specific code examples are provided for suggested improvements
  
  Throughout all sections, specific "Before" and "After" code examples are provided for each suggested improvement, with clear explanation of the issue and solution.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm issues are properly categorized by technical aspect
  
  Issues are clearly categorized into 6 distinct technical aspects (sections), with each issue properly numbered and organized within its relevant category.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure before/after code examples demonstrate clear improvements
  
  Each issue identified includes:
  - A "Before" code example showing the problematic code
  - A "Why" explanation detailing the issue
  - An "After" code example demonstrating the improved implementation
  
  The improvements are clearly demonstrated and explained in each case.
