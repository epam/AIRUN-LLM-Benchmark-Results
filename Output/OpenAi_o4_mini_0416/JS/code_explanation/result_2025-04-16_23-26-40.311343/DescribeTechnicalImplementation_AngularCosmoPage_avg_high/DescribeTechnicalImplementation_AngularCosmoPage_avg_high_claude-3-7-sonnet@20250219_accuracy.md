# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies Angular.js as the framework used
    
    The documentation consistently and correctly identifies AngularJS as the framework used throughout the document. It mentions "AngularJS 'Page Editor' module" in the component overview, references Angular-specific concepts like modules, factories, controllers, and directives, and includes Angular-specific dependencies like ngResource, ngRoute, and ngFileUpload.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all factories (REST, Page, Users) are accurately documented with their purposes
    
    All three factories are thoroughly documented with clear purposes:
    - REST factory: For RESTful client endpoints, using $resource for CRUD operations
    - Page factory: Singleton to hold current page state and share data between controllers/components
    - Users factory: Singleton for current user profile data, injected into pageCtrl for author attribution

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of the Page controller and its functionality is technically accurate
    
    The documentation accurately describes the pageCtrl controller's functionality, including initialization of $scope.page, detecting unsaved changes, performing CRUD operations, auto-generating URL slugs, handling autosave, managing tag autocomplete, and implementing publish scheduling logic. The methods listed in section 4.4 (pageCtrl Scope API) align with these functionalities.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the RESTful API endpoints are correctly documented
    
    Section 4.1 thoroughly documents the REST factory endpoints with a detailed table showing Resource names, URL patterns, URL parameters, and available methods. The endpoints follow RESTful conventions and include appropriate methods (query, get, save, update, delete) for each resource.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of Angular module dependencies ($resource, $location, etc.) is correct
    
    The documentation correctly explains the Angular module dependencies in section 2 and section 5.1:
    - ngResource for $resource (REST operations)
    - ngRoute (or UI-Router) for $location & $routeParams
    - ngFileUpload for file uploads
    - pascalprecht.translate for i18n

    These dependencies are consistent with the functionality described throughout the document.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the page management features (creating, editing, deleting) are accurately described
    
    The documentation thoroughly describes the page management features:
    - Creating pages via "/new" route
    - Editing existing pages via "/{pageUrl}" route
    - Deleting pages via deletePage() method
    - Duplicating pages via savePage(duplicate) parameter
    - Additional features like autosave, revisions, and publishing controls are also accurately described

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the documentation accurately explains how the local storage mechanism works
    
    The documentation accurately explains the localStorage mechanism for offline state and autosave. It describes how pageCtrl loads unsaved localStorage entries during initialization, how autosave pushes to both Page and localStorage, and how it detects unsaved local changes to offer "Revert"/"Discard" options via the newerVersion flag.

- **Pass** (95%): Check that the description of form validation logic is technically accurate
    
    The documentation mentions form validation in various places, including required fields in the property tables and the "required" attribute in HTML examples. However, it doesn't provide a comprehensive explanation of all validation logic. The example shows the use of the required attribute for the page.type select field, but doesn't elaborate on other validation methods or error handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of publish/schedule date handling is correct
    
    The documentation correctly explains the publish/schedule date handling, mentioning that:
    - published field can be "Y", "N", or "schedule"
    - published_date stores the epoch timestamp
    - pageCtrl handles "Publish scheduling logic (now vs. schedule vs. draft)"
    - The form includes "Publish radio + schedule date (datetime-local)" inputs

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the tag management and autocomplete feature explanation is technically accurate
    
    The tag management and autocomplete features are accurately explained:
    - Tags are stored as Array[String] in the page object
    - The controller includes autocompleteTags() and selectSuggestion(tag) methods
    - Tags are populated via REST.contentTags.query
    - The page.suggestions array stores autocomplete suggestions
    - Form includes "Tags (comma-list with autocomplete)"

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the relationship between controllers, factories, and templates is accurately explained
    
    The documentation provides a clear explanation of how controllers, factories, and templates interact:
    - Factories (REST, Page, Users) provide data and services
    - pageCtrl controller initializes $scope.page from Page + $routeParams + localStorage
    - The page.html template uses ng-controller="pageCtrl" and binds to $scope properties
    - Section 2 (Architecture & How It Fits) shows the hierarchy and flow of data
    - The routing configuration shows how templates and controllers are connected

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation correctly identifies and explains the purpose of broadcast events
    
    The documentation correctly identifies and explains broadcast events:
    - Success/failure notifications are broadcast via $rootScope
    - updatePageType() method syncs type → Page + broadcasts
    - Events are used with $translate + $rootScope.$broadcast('notify',…) for i18n notifications
    - The flow description mentions that success/failure notifications are broadcast via $rootScope
