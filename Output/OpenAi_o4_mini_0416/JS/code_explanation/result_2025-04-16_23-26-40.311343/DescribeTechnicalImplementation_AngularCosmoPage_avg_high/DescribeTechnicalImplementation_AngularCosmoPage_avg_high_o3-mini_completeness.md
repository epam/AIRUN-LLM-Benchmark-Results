# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation includes a comprehensive component overview explaining the purpose and architecture  
  The document clearly begins with a "Component Overview" section that explains the AngularJS "Page Editor" module, its features, and its integration into the overall system via the cosmo Angular module.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all major components (REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and Page controller) are documented  
  The documentation details each major component—the REST factory, Page factory, Users factory, and pageCtrl controller—with clear descriptions and responsibilities.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure all significant features of the page management system are described  
  The document includes thorough descriptions of CRUD operations, auto‑save, scheduling, revision management, and duplicate/delete functionalities, covering the significant features of the system.

- **Pass** (95%): Check that all form inputs and their behavior are documented  
  The documentation explains the form inputs (e.g., title, description, tags, URL slug, publish options) and associated behaviors. However, while the description is adequate, further elaboration on input validations and dynamic behaviors could offer more depth.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page versioning and revision system  
  Revision management is addressed in multiple sections (both in the Component Overview and REST endpoints), ensuring that the versioning and revision mechanisms are clearly described.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation covers the tag system and autocomplete functionality  
  The tag system is documented through the details in both the REST endpoints (REST.contentTags) and the pageCtrl scope API (autocompleteTags and selectSuggestion), providing a comprehensive view of tag management.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure the documentation includes explanation of error handling and user notifications  
  The documentation mentions that success/failure notifications are broadcast via $rootScope and that there are mechanisms for handling errors (e.g., in CRUD operations). Nonetheless, specifics on error recovery or detailed error handling strategies are not deeply described, hence a slightly reduced confidence level.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains the page publishing workflow including scheduling  
  There is a clear explanation of publishing logic, including the auto‑save, publish statuses (now, schedule, draft), and scheduling via a datetime-local input.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the documentation details how content extras and additional metadata are managed  
  Content extras are covered under both the REST endpoints (e.g., REST.contentExtras) and the Page Factory properties, providing a clear picture of how extra metadata and custom fields are managed.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the documentation explains how the UI interacts with the backend APIs  
  The document details the usage of AngularJS services, how the $resource is utilized for REST calls, and provides sample usage examples and routing configurations that illustrate the UI-to-backend interaction.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the documentation includes sample usage examples or patterns  
  Sample usage is shown through module setup, script inclusion in HTML, template usage (page.html), and routing examples—offering clear patterns for implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the documentation explains all significant event broadcasting and inter-component communication  
  The documentation discusses broadcasting (e.g., notifications via $rootScope.$broadcast) and mentions event-based interactions within the page editor, addressing inter-component communications adequately.
