# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x  
  The use of React's useId (introduced in React 18) and other React 18 patterns confirms that the component is implemented using React 18.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions  
  The file uses the .tsx extension, proper interface definitions (such as Option and SearchableSelectProps), and comprehensive prop type annotations.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling  
  An index.css file is provided with the required class definitions, and it is imported in the usage example.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments  
  The code is free of any TODO or commented-out code and follows consistent formatting, indicating production readiness.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility  
  The component correctly uses useState to manage its state, including controlled versus uncontrolled selection and the dropdown open/closed status.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props  
  With props like options, value, onChange, and placeholder, the component is designed to be reusable and customizable.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection  
  The component supports keyboard navigation (ArrowUp, ArrowDown, Enter, and Escape) and handles key events appropriately for both the control and the search input.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions  
  The use of useRef for managing DOM elements (containerRef, controlRef, inputRef) and focus redirection via requestAnimationFrame aligns well with React best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques  
  Focus is managed effectively by moving focus to the search input when opening and returning it to the control when closing the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility  
  ARIA attributes such as role, aria-haspopup, aria-expanded, aria-controls, aria-activedescendant, and aria-selected are properly applied, promoting accessibility.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings  
  From a static review, the code appears clean and free from obvious issues that would trigger console errors or warnings. However, without runtime testing, there is a slight uncertainty.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component  
  The component is written in a straightforward manner. Although every render recalculates filteredOptions, this is not necessarily problematic given typical option list sizes. However, further optimization (e.g., memoization) might be considered for very large datasets, which is why I'm not fully 100% confident.
