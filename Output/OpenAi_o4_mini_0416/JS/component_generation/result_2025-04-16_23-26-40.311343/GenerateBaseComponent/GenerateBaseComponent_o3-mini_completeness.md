# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The code renders a main control element and, when open, includes a dropdown container with the options list.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  The component conditionally renders an input element inside the dropdown for searching.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The implementation uses a controlled/uncontrolled approach with a single selected Option, ensuring only one item is ever selected.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The handleSearchKeyDown function correctly handles "ArrowDown" and "ArrowUp" to update the highlighted index.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  Pressing Enter in the search input triggers selection of the highlighted option through the selectOption function.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  The handleControlKeyDown function toggles the dropdown state on an Enter key press when the control is focused.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  A useEffect hook focuses the control element via controlRef when isOpen changes to false.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  The onClick event on each option calls selectOption, which in turn calls closeDropdown to hide the dropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  Selecting an option with the Enter key in the search input closes the dropdown after calling selectOption.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  In handleSearchKeyDown, pressing the Escape key prevents default behavior and calls closeDropdown.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  An event listener attached to document (on mousedown) checks for clicks outside the component and calls setIsOpen(false).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  The keydown handler on the control element toggles the dropdown open when Enter is pressed and the component is focused.
