# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
    
    The application correctly fetches Star Wars characters from the SWAPI API using axios, and displays them in a list using the CharacterList component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
    
    The application shows a loading state with "Loading characters…" text while the API call is in progress, controlled by the `loading` state variable.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
    
    All characters from the API response (stored in `data.results`) are saved to the `characters` state and passed to the CharacterList component which maps through and displays each one.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
    
    The application is minimal and focused on displaying the character list only. There are no search inputs or other user input fields present.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
    
    The CharacterList component maps through each character and displays its name within list items: `<li key={char.url}>{char.name}</li>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
    
    The instructions confirm this is a Create-React-App project with TypeScript, and the files structure (package.json, tsconfig.json, src folder organization) is consistent with CRA.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
    
    The App component properly manages three state variables:
    - `characters`: Stores the fetched character data
    - `loading`: Tracks whether the API call is in progress
    - `error`: Captures any errors during the API call

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
    
    Each character list item has a unique key derived from the character's URL: `<li key={char.url}>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
    
    The application handles three different states appropriately:
    - Loading state: Shows "Loading characters…"
    - Error state: Shows "Error fetching characters: [error message]"
    - Empty state: If no errors occur and characters array is empty, it would render an empty list (implicit handling)
