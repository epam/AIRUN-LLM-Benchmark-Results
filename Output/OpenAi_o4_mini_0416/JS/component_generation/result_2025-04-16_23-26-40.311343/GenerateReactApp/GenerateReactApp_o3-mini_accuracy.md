# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses React 18.x or newer by checking the package.json dependencies  
  The package.json file specifies "react": "^18.2.0" and "react-dom": "^18.2.0", confirming the usage of React 18.x.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that TypeScript is properly implemented with appropriate type definitions for all components, props, and states  
  The project contains a tsconfig.json file, and the components and props are well-typed (e.g., the Character interface and React.FC<Props> usage).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Axios is used for API requests to fetch data from the Star Wars API endpoint  
  Axios is imported and used in App.tsx to call the API with proper TypeScript generics.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles API errors gracefully with appropriate error states or messages  
  The App component uses a try/catch block in an async function inside useEffect to handle errors, and it updates the error state accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the character data is fetched on component mount using useEffect hook  
  The useEffect hook is correctly implemented with an empty dependency array to fetch data on mount.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application properly manages component rendering optimization  
  The CharacterList component is wrapped with React.memo to optimize its rendering.
