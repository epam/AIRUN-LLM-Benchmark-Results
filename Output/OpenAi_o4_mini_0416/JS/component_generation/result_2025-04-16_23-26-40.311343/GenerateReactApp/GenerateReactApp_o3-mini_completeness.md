# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The App component fetches character data and renders it using the CharacterList component. This confirms that the list is populated with the API data.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The code conditionally renders a "Loading characters…" message when the loading state is true, which serves as a visual indicator during the API fetch.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  Once the API call completes successfully, the characters are stored in state and are passed to CharacterList, where each character is rendered. This indicates that all fetched characters will be displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  The provided code does not contain any search bars, input fields, or filtering components. The application strictly fetches and displays the data with no user input for search.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  In the CharacterList component, each list item is rendered using the character's name (as in <code>{char.name}</code>), ensuring that the character names are displayed as required.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The instructions indicate that the project was bootstrapped with Create React App using the TypeScript template, and the file structure (package.json, tsconfig.json, src/*) matches the expectations for such a project.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The App component uses React's useState hook to manage three separate states: for characters, loading status, and potential error messages. This shows proper state management in the context of the requirements.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  The CharacterList component assigns a unique key to each list item via the character’s URL (<code>key={char.url}</code>), satisfying the uniqueness requirement for list rendering.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  The application renders an empty list in the event that the fetch returns no characters. While this is technically correct (an empty array produces no list items), it does not provide any user feedback (like a “No characters found” message) for an empty state. This element might be acceptable depending on the design requirements, but the lack of an explicit empty state message causes a slight reduction in confidence.
