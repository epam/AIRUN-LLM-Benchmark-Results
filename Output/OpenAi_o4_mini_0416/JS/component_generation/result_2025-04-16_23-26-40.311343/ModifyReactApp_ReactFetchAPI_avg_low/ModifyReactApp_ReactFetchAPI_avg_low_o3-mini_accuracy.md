# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type  
  The input field has an onChange handler (handleChange) that updates the state via setSearchTerm, ensuring the state accurately reflects user input.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls  
  The custom hook useDebounce is implemented and used with a delay of 500ms, which falls within the desired range.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured  
  Axios is imported and used for making GET requests to the SWAPI endpoint, with proper configuration of request parameters.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses  
  The code defines TypeScript interfaces (Character, ApiResponse) and uses strict typing in function components, hooks, and even for error boundaries.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters  
  In the fetchCharacters function, the endpoint 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' is used along with conditional inclusion of the search parameter when a query exists.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate  
  Both fetchCharacters and handleChange functions are wrapped in useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-creations during re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback  
  A try/catch block in fetchCharacters handles potential API errors by setting an error message in the state and logging errors to the console for debugging.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing  
  The useDebounce hook ensures that the API call is made only after 500ms of inactivity, meaning it waits for the user to stop typing before fetching data.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices  
  The code effectively uses useState for managing searchTerm, characters, loading, and error, adhering to React’s recommended state management practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code  
  No extraneous or commented-out code is present and all imported modules (React, ReactDOM, axios) are actively used in the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests  
  The loading state is set to true before the API call and reset to false in the finally block, ensuring accurate tracking of the request’s progress.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns  
  The code uses ReactDOM.createRoot for bootstrapping and wraps the app in React.StrictMode, reflecting proper adherence to React 18 practices.
