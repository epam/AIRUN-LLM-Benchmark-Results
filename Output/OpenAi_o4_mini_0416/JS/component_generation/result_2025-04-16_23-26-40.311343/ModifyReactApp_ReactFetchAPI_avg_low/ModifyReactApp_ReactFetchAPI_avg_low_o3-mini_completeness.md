# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The provided code includes an `<input>` element with a placeholder "Search characters..." that is controlled by state. This input is used to update the search query, thereby filtering the displayed characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  The component conditionally renders `<p>Loadingâ€¦</p>` based on the `loading` state, clearly indicating that a loading indicator is present during API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  On component mount, the `useEffect` triggers `fetchCharacters` with an empty query (when `debouncedSearch` is empty), ensuring that the default `/people` data is fetched.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  The `useDebounce` hook combined with state updates allows the component to make new API calls as the user types. This results in dynamic updating of the search results after a short debounce period.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  The code checks if there are no results (`characters.length === 0`) and renders a `<p>No characters found.</p>` message, providing clear feedback to the user.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  Inline styles applied to the search input (such as `width: 100%` and responsive padding) ensure that the component adapts well to different screen sizes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  The results are rendered conditionally by mapping over the `characters` array once data is fetched, ensuring that search results are displayed correctly after a successful API response.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  An `ErrorBoundary` class component is provided which catches rendering and runtime errors. This wrapper around the main component ensures that errors are managed gracefully.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The answer defines TypeScript interfaces (`Character` and `ApiResponse`) as well as proper typing for components and hooks, ensuring strict type checking throughout the file.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The implementation preserves the original functionality by fetching the default data on mount, while the new search input and debouncing logic provide additional capabilities without breaking any existing behaviors.
