# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers all main functionality including adding, editing, deleting, and toggling todos
  
  The document clearly describes all the main functionality:
  - Adding: "Creation: header input in TodoApp.handleNewTodoKeyDown → model.addTodo → inform → re‑render"
  - Editing: "Update: inline edit in TodoItem (double‑click, ENTER to save, ESC to cancel) → model.save"
  - Deleting: "Deletion: destroy button in TodoItem → model.destroy"
  - Toggling: "Single toggle: checkbox in TodoItem → props.onToggle → model.toggle" and "Bulk toggle: 'toggle‑all' checkbox in TodoApp → toggleAll → model.toggleAll"

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about filtering todos by status (all, active, completed)
  
  The document explains filtering functionality: "Filtering – view all, active, or completed items. – Hash‑based routes in TodoApp.componentDidMount (Router binding to '/', '/active', '/completed') – state.nowShowing drives the filter in render() via todos.filter."

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the user workflow for creating new todo items
  
  The document describes the workflow in both section 1 and section 4a: "User types in header + ENTER → App.handleNewTodoKeyDown → model.addTodo → TodoModel informs → render() → App re‑reads model.todos → new TodoItem appears" and "Adding todos – Focused input at top, placeholder 'What needs to be done?' – ENTER_KEY (13) triggers add; empties field afterward."

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the editing functionality triggered by double-clicking
  
  The document clearly explains the editing functionality: "Editing todos – Double‑click label in view mode → handleEdit sets App.state.editing → TodoItem.render shows .edit field – Input auto‑focused (componentDidUpdate) – ENTER saves (handleKeyDown → handleSubmit) – ESCAPE_KEY (27) cancels, reverts text (handleKeyDown → onCancel) – onBlur also triggers handleSubmit (persist or delete if blank)"

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the clear completed functionality
  
  The document covers this functionality: "Clear completed – footer button to remove all completed todos. – TodoFooter onClearCompleted → TodoApp.clearCompleted → model.clearCompleted" and "Clearing completed – Footer 'Clear completed' visible only if completedCount > 0 → onClearCompleted"

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the toggle all functionality
  
  The document describes this functionality: "Bulk toggle: 'toggle‑all' checkbox in TodoApp → toggleAll → model.toggleAll" and "Toggling complete – Bulk: click on #toggle‑all checkbox, label 'Mark all as complete' toggles every item."

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the counter for remaining items
  
  The document mentions the counter in the TodoFooter component description: "TodoFooter (footer.tsx) – summary and filter links – Props: count, completedCount, nowShowing, onClearCompleted"

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the persistent storage of todos
  
  The document explains persistent storage: "Persistent storage – todos survive reload via browser localStorage. – Utils.store reads/writes JSON under a key ('react‑todos') in TodoModel." and "All todo data lives in TodoModel.todos; persisted via Utils.store"

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the UI components and their relationships
  
  The document provides a detailed breakdown of the components and their relationships in section 2, including TodoModel, TodoApp, TodoItem, TodoFooter, Utils, and constants.ts, along with how they interact.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the business objectives addressed by the application
  
  Section 5 specifically addresses business objectives: "Primary goal: Provide a simple, zero‑configuration task manager that persists locally and is easy to use. Secondary/demo objectives: Show React + TypeScript best practices, Exhibit a clean separation of concerns"

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes performance and scalability considerations
  
  Section 7 is dedicated to performance and scalability considerations, covering shouldComponentUpdate, immutable updates, bulk operations, re-rendering strategies, and localStorage limitations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes technical constraints and limitations
  
  Section 6 thoroughly covers constraints and assumptions: browser-only nature, localStorage limitations, lack of backend, global Router assumptions, re-rendering approach, TypeScript interfaces, and absence of authentication or multi-user capabilities.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the pluralization of item/items text based on count
  
  The document mentions this functionality in the Utils section: "Utils (utils.ts) – uuid generator, pluralize, localStorage wrapper, shallow extend"
