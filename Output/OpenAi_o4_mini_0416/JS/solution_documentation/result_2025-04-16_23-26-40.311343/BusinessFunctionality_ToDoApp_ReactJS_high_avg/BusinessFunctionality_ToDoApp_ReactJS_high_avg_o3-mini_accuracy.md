# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document identifies the application as a Todo list management application  
  The document clearly outlines task management features (create, read, update, delete todos) and describes the core functionality of a todo list app.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the component structure (TodoApp, TodoItem, TodoFooter)  
  The report details the role of TodoApp as the root container, TodoItem as a representation of each todo, and TodoFooter for filter controls and summary statistics.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of local storage for data persistence  
  The explanation explicitly states that persistent storage is achieved via browser localStorage using the Utils.store functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the state management approach using the TodoModel  
  The document explains that the TodoModel serves as the state container and how it manages the array of todos along with a pub/sub mechanism for UI updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the routing mechanism for filtering todos  
  It correctly notes the use of hash‑based routes in TodoApp.componentDidMount, which updates the filtering state based on the URL hash (e.g., '/', '/active', '/completed').

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the event handling for user interactions  
  The answer covers various user interactions, including adding, toggling (single and bulk), editing (with key event handling), and deletion, along with inline editing and onBlur/save behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of immutable data structures for state management  
  The report explains that mutations in the TodoModel are handled by replacing the array (using immutable patterns) and subsequently updating the view.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the performance optimization using shouldComponentUpdate  
  It explicitly mentions that TodoItem employs shouldComponentUpdate to prevent unnecessary re‑renders, outlining the performance considerations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the document correctly identifies the use of the Utils class for helper functions  
  The answer notes the presence of a Utils module used for various helper functions such as uuid generation, pluralization, and localStorage operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the document accurately describes the data flow between components  
  The description covers the interactions between the model, view components, and routing. It details how the TodoModel updates trigger re‑rendering of components via callbacks and data flow.
