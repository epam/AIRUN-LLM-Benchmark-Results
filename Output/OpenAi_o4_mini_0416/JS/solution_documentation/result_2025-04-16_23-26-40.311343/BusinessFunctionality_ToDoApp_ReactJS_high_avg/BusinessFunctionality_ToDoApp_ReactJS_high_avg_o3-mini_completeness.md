# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers all main functionality including adding, editing, deleting, and toggling todos  
  The answer clearly outlines the functionality for task creation (“Creation: … model.addTodo”), update (“Update: … TodoItem editing”), deletion (“Deletion: … model.destroy”) and individual/bulk toggling (“Single toggle: … model.toggle”, “Bulk toggle: … model.toggleAll”). 

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about filtering todos by status (all, active, completed)  
  The answer specifies that filtering is implemented via hash-based routes ("/", "/active", "/completed") and describes the filter mechanism driven by state (nowShowing) in the render method.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the user workflow for creating new todo items  
  The workflow for adding todos is detailed in multiple sections, including the header input behavior and the key event handling in the flow: "User types in header + ENTER → App.handleNewTodoKeyDown → model.addTodo".

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the editing functionality triggered by double-clicking  
  The answer describes the inline edit approach in the TodoItem, indicating that a double-click activates the edit state and outlining the subsequent events for saving (ENTER) or canceling (ESC).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the clear completed functionality  
  The clear completed behavior is described under Business Requirements with details about how the TodoFooter's onClearCompleted triggers the clearCompleted flow in the model.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the toggle all functionality  
  The document explains the “toggle‑all” checkbox and how its associated handler (`toggleAll`) calls `model.toggleAll` to affect every todo item.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the counter for remaining items  
  The answer covers the counter as part of TodoFooter, which includes a count for remaining todos and completedCount for completed items.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes information about the persistent storage of todos  
  The use of localStorage for data persistence is clearly mentioned, with details about how Utils.store handles JSON under a specific key within TodoModel.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes the UI components and their relationships  
  The answer provides an in-depth breakdown of each UI component (TodoModel, TodoApp, TodoItem, TodoFooter) and their interactions, clearly mapping data flow and event callbacks.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the business objectives addressed by the application  
  The document outlines both primary and secondary business objectives, describing the design goals (simplicity, local persistence, demonstration of React + TypeScript best practices) and how these are achieved.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the document includes performance and scalability considerations  
  The answer dedicates a section to performance, discussing shouldComponentUpdate usage, immutable updates, and potential issues with full re‑rendering on model changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the document describes technical constraints and limitations  
  The document enumerates technical constraints such as browser-only operation, synchronous localStorage operations, and limitations on scalability and data size.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the document covers the pluralization of item/items text based on count  
  The document mentions that the Utils module includes a “pluralize” function, indicating that proper pluralization based on item count is handled.
