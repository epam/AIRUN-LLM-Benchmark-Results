# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props
  
  The code consistently uses TypeScript throughout with proper type annotations. All components have properly typed props interfaces, functions have return types, and variables are strictly typed. For example, the `PageFormProps` interface in `PageForm.tsx` and the typed state in Redux slices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management
  
  The code clearly demonstrates Redux Toolkit usage with `createSlice`, `createAsyncThunk`, and proper store configuration in `src/app/store.ts`. The `contentSlice.ts` shows a complete implementation with initial state, reducers, and extra reducers handling async operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components
  
  All components in the code are implemented as functional components using hooks. Examples include `PageEditor`, `PageForm`, and `AppRouter`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately
  
  The code demonstrates proper usage of React hooks including `useState` in `useLocalStorage`, `useEffect` for side effects in `PageEditor`, and `useCallback` for memoized callbacks. The hooks follow React's rules with proper dependency arrays.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource
  
  The code uses axios for API communication as shown in `src/api/client.ts` and the implementation of API services in `src/api/contentApi.ts`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components
  
  Form handling in `PageForm.tsx` properly implements controlled components with value and onChange props tied to component state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation
  
  React Router v6 is implemented in `src/routes/AppRouter.tsx` with proper route definitions, navigation, and param handling via `useParams` in the `PageEditor` component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization
  
  The code uses `react-i18next` for internationalization as shown in `src/i18n/index.ts` and demonstrated in the `PageForm` component with the `useTranslation` hook.

- **Pass** (90%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization
  
  While code splitting isn't explicitly shown in the code snippets provided, the migration plan mentions that code splitting can be added via `React.lazy` and `Suspense`. The folder structure supports code splitting, but without explicit implementation shown, I can't be 100% confident.

- **Fail** (95%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations
  
  There's no explicit usage of `React.memo` for component memoization in the provided code. While `useCallback` is used which suggests performance optimization awareness, the requirement specifically asks for `React.memo` which is not present.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks
  
  All `useEffect` and `useCallback` hooks include proper dependency arrays. For example, in `PageEditor.tsx`, the `useEffect` for loading content depends on `[dispatch, pageUrl]` and the `useCallback` for `onChange` depends on `[dispatch, draft, setDraft]`.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models
  
  The code defines comprehensive TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/index.ts` for data models like `Content`, `NewContentDTO`, and `User`.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state
  
  Redux selectors are properly implemented and used, such as `selectContent` and `selectSuggestions` in the content slice, and they are used in the `PageEditor` component with `useAppSelector`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations
  
  The code implements proper action creators both for synchronous operations (`setLocalContent`, `clearSuggestions`) and asynchronous operations using `createAsyncThunk` (e.g., `loadContent`, `addContent`).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks
  
  A custom `useLocalStorage` hook is implemented in `src/app/hooks/useLocalStorage.ts` and properly used in the `PageEditor` component for draft persistence.
