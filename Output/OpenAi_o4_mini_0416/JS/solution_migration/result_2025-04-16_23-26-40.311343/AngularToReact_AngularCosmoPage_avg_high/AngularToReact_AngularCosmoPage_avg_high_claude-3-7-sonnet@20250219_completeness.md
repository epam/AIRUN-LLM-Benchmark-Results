# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented

    The code shows implementations for create and update (via `addContent` and `editContent` async thunks), but there is no clear implementation of duplicate functionality. The delete functionality exists in the `removeContent` thunk, but it's not being used in the UI components shown.

    I'm 90% confident because while create, update, and delete are defined in the API and Redux layer, duplicate functionality is missing, and the delete functionality isn't integrated into the PageEditor component.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present

    The code includes a `type` field in the Content interface, but there is no implementation of page type selection in the PageForm component. There's no dropdown or selector for different page types visible in the form.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists

    The code shows URL as a regular input field in the PageForm component, but there is no auto-generation functionality that would create a URL slug based on the title. There's no event handler or effect that would update the URL when the title changes.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented

    The code implements tag management with autocomplete suggestions through:
    - Tag input field in PageForm
    - Suggestions array display
    - onFetchTags function that dispatches getTagSuggestions
    - onSelectTag function to add selected tags
    - API integration with fetchTagSuggestions

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available

    While the Content interface includes a `published` field with 'Y', 'N', or 'schedule' options, there's no UI component or form element in the PageForm to select these options.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented

    The Content interface includes a `published_date` field, but there's no date picker or time selection UI component in the PageForm to set this value.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present

    The code implements local storage through:
    - Custom `useLocalStorage` hook that persists and retrieves data
    - Draft storage with a unique key based on the page URL
    - Loading draft data on component mount
    - Syncing changes to both Redux and local storage

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented

    There is no visible implementation of a notification or toast system for displaying success or error messages after operations like saving a page.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present

    The form implementation doesn't include any validation logic for required fields. There are no checks for empty values or invalid formats before submission.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled

    The code defines API endpoints for:
    - Fetching content
    - Creating content
    - Updating content
    - Deleting content
    - Fetching tag suggestions
    - Saving tags
    - Deleting tags
    
    These appear to be comprehensive and properly mapped to Redux thunks.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented

    While the Content interface includes an `extras` field of type `Record<string, any>`, there's no UI component or form element in the PageForm to manage these extra fields.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained

    There is no implementation of revision history functionality visible in the provided code. This would typically include retrieving previous versions, comparing changes, or reverting to earlier revisions.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components

    The code follows a clear organization pattern:
    - Business logic in Redux slices and API services
    - UI components separated into presentational (PageForm) and container (PageEditor) components
    - Clear folder structure with types, API, components, pages, routes, etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved

    The code implements i18n through:
    - Configuration in i18n/index.ts
    - Usage of useTranslation hook in components
    - t() function for translating UI text
    - Translations stored in en.json

- **Pass** (70%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters

    The routing setup in AppRouter.tsx shows routes for "/new" and "/:pageUrl", which aligns with the requirements. However, I can't be 100% confident without seeing the original URL structure, and there's no implementation for handling query parameters if they were part of the original application.
