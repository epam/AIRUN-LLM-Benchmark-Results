# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props  
  All files use TypeScript (.ts/.tsx), interfaces are defined (e.g., for data models and component props), and variables and functions are appropriately typed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management  
  The code uses Redux Toolkit’s createSlice, createAsyncThunk, and configureStore for managing application state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components  
  All components (e.g., PageEditor, PageForm, AppRouter) are implemented as functional components.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately  
  The sample makes correct use of hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useCallback. Although useMemo is not present, it is not required since there are no obvious computationally expensive render operations. This is why the confidence here is 90%.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource  
  Axios is used for API communication in the provided api files, replacing Angular’s $resource.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components  
  The PageForm component demonstrates controlled form inputs with state updates on onChange handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation  
  React Router v6 is used in AppRouter.tsx with BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, and Navigate components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization  
  The code uses react-i18next for internationalization, and i18n is properly initialized with a JSON resource.

- **Fail** (95%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization  
  Although the plan mentions code splitting (using React.lazy/Suspense), there is no concrete implementation in the provided code. Hence, this step is not fulfilled.  
  Explanation: The code outlines that you “can code‐split” but does not provide a working example of code splitting.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations  
  There is no usage of React.memo in the provided code, which is specifically recommended for optimizing expensive render operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks  
  Dependency arrays are properly included in useEffect and useCallback hooks to ensure correct behavior and avoid unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models  
  Interfaces for data models (Content, NewContentDTO, User) are provided and used consistently throughout the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state  
  Redux selectors (selectContent, selectSuggestions) are clearly defined and accessed from the slice.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations  
  The code defines and uses action creators (e.g., setLocalContent and clearSuggestions) to modify the state reliably.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks  
  The custom hook useLocalStorage is implemented to handle local storage access correctly.
