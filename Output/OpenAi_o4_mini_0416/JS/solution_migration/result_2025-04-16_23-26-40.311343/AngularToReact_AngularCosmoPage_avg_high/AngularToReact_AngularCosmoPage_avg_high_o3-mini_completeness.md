# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
  Although the migration blueprint implements creating, updating, and deleting pages, there is no evidence of a duplicate functionality. This omission reduces the completeness of page management.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
  The provided code does not show any UI or logic for selecting a page type. The PageForm component only handles title, description, URL, and tags.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
  There is no mechanism in the code to automatically generate a URL based on the title. The URL field is manually entered by the user instead.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
  The code includes the use of async thunk getTagSuggestions, a controlled input for tags, and a display of suggestion buttons, which confirms autocomplete functionality for tag management.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
  Although the Content interface specifies a "published" field with values ('Y' | 'N' | 'schedule'), there is no UI component or logic present in the migration code that allows users to select among these publishing options.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
  The Content interface includes a published_date field for scheduling, but there is no user interface or logic in the provided code to manage scheduled publishing dates.

- **Fail** (80%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
  While a useLocalStorage hook is used to persist draft data, the functionality is limited to saving and restoring drafts. There is no additional logic for comparing versions or managing conflict resolution.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
  No notification system (such as toast messages or alerts) is present for informing the user about success or error states following actions (e.g., saving or API call failures).

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
  The sample form does not incorporate any validation logic to ensure that required fields, such as URL or page type, are provided before submission.

- **Fail** (80%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
  The API service handles fetching, creating, updating, and deleting content, as well as tag-related endpoints. However, without further context on the complete suite of endpoints in the original Angular application (for example, endpoints for duplicate pages or additional content features), it appears that not all might be covered.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
  Even though the Content interface includes an "extras" property, there is no demonstration in the code that shows any operations or UI elements for managing these extra properties.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
  There is no implementation of revision history management or tracking in the provided code, which indicates a missing feature compared to the original functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
  The folder structure clearly separates API, app logic (Redux slices, store, hooks), UI components, and pages. This demonstrates a well-organized codebase with proper separation of concerns.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
  Internationalization is implemented using react-i18next with a dedicated i18n folder and integration in components (e.g., using the useTranslation hook in PageForm).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
  The routing configuration in AppRouter.tsx preserves similar URL structures (i.e., "/new" for creating new pages and "/:pageUrl" for editing a page) with a fallback route that redirects appropriately.
