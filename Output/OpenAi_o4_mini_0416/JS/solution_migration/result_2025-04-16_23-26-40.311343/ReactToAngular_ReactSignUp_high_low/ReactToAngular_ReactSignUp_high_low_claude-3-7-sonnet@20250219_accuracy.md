# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling
  
  The component clearly uses Angular's Reactive Forms approach. This is evident from the import of FormBuilder, FormGroup, and Validators from '@angular/forms', and the implementation of form creation in the ngOnInit method using FormBuilder.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)
  
  The form setup in the SignupComponent's ngOnInit method correctly implements all required validations:
  - Name: Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3), Validators.maxLength(60)
  - Email: Validators.required, Validators.email
  - Password: Validators.required, Validators.minLength(6)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use
  
  The component implements custom AsyncValidatorFn functions (uniqueNameValidator and uniqueEmailValidator) that call the API service methods isName and isEmail to check if the name and email are already in use.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched
  
  The HTML template for each form field includes ngClass directives that conditionally apply 'has-error' or 'has-success' classes based on the validation state and whether the field has been touched.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions
  
  The onSubmit method correctly dispatches the signup action with the form values when the form is valid, which then triggers the effect that calls the API service.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails
  
  The component template includes span elements with the class "help-block" that display appropriate error messages when validation fails, including server errors, unique name/email errors, and standard validation errors.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service
  
  There is no evidence in the provided code that the Title service is being used to set the page title. The Title service is not imported, injected, or used in any of the components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management
  
  The component imports Store from '@ngrx/store', injects it in the constructor, and uses it to select state and dispatch actions. The effects are defined in auth.effects.ts and registered in the app.module.ts.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress
  
  The submit button includes a [disabled] attribute bound to "loading$ | async", which disables the button when the loading state is true.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses
  
  The auth.effects.ts file contains proper error handling using catchError operator, and the component subscribes to the error$ observable to update form field errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management
  
  The component follows Angular best practices by implementing OnInit, using ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush for better performance, properly structuring the component with clear separation of concerns, and managing form state correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises
  
  The ApiService properly uses Angular's HttpClient for API calls, returning Observables instead of Promises, which is the recommended approach.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements
  
  The error messages in the template match the validation requirements, showing specific messages for server errors, unique name/email errors, and standard validation errors.
