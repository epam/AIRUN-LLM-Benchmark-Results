# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The component creates the form with FormBuilder (using fb.group) and specifies validators.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  The form group defines synchronous validators on all three fields: name (required, minLength(3), maxLength(60)), email (required, email), and password (required, minLength(6)).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  The component registers two asynchronous validators – uniqueNameValidator and uniqueEmailValidator – which call the corresponding API endpoints to verify uniqueness.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The template uses conditional CSS classes (has-error and has-success) based on touch and validity status of each control.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  Upon submission (in the onSubmit method), if the form is valid, the component dispatches the signup action. The API call itself is triggered via NgRx effects, ensuring proper flow through state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  The template includes <span> elements that conditionally display error messages from local validators as well as server errors for each form control.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  There is no usage of Angular's Title service anywhere in the component or module. Hence, the page title is not being set as required.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The code leverages Store (with selectors) in the component and NgRx Effects in the AuthEffects, demonstrating state management via @ngrx libraries.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button’s disabled state is bound to "loading$ | async," which correctly prevents submission during an ongoing sign-up process.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  The AuthEffects file shows that the API call uses mergeMap to handle the successful response (dispatching signupSuccess) and catchError to dispatch signupFailure on error.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component implements OnInit correctly, uses a clean structure, and organizes validators and subscriptions. However, the direct subscription to error$ in ngOnInit is not explicitly unsubscribed, which might be acceptable if the component lives for the duration of the app but may be improved using async pipes or unsubscribing strategies.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The ApiService uses Angular’s HttpClient for GET and POST requests, adhering to best practices for handling API calls in Angular.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The messages shown in the template (e.g., "Name must be between 3 and 60 characters in length", "A valid email address is required", "Password must be at least 6 characters") match the expected validation feedback.
