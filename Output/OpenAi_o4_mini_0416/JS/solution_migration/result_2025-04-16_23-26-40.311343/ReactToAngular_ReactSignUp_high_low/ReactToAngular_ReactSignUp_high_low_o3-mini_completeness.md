  The template provides a link (<a routerLink="/login">) with the text "Already a member? Log in here."

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the FormGroup component or equivalent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display  
  The code initializes a FormGroup in SignupComponent and the HTML template uses "formGroup" along with "ngClass" to manage styling and error messages per field.

  The signup button includes an <i> element with the "glyphicon glyphicon-sign-in" classes which serves as the icon.
