# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The code clearly uses Angular syntax and imports that are compatible with Angular 14.x, including imports from '@angular/core' and other Angular packages. The structure and architecture follow Angular conventions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
  
  The implementation includes proper imports from '@ngrx/store', with a clear store setup in the app.module.ts and todos.module.ts. State management is handled using NgRx actions, reducers, and selectors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
  
  The code properly implements @ngrx/effects for handling localStorage persistence with the TodoEffects class, including the loadTodos$ and saveTodos$ effect implementations.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
  
  The implementation includes well-structured actions (todo.actions.ts), reducers (todo.reducer.ts), and selectors (todo.selectors.ts) following NgRx best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
  
  All components properly use the @Component decorator, and child components utilize @Input and @Output decorators for communication with parent components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators
  
  React refs have been replaced with Angular's @ViewChild approach in TodoInputComponent and TodoItemComponent for direct DOM access.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
  
  Components like TodoListComponent and TodoItemComponent properly use @Input() for receiving data and @Output() with EventEmitter for communicating events to parent components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
  
  The Utils class is provided as a service in the TodosModule, and business logic is handled through NgRx effects and services.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
  
  Dependency injection is properly implemented throughout the application, particularly in the TodoEffects class and TodoAppComponent where the Store and ActivatedRoute are injected.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate
  
  Components use ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush where appropriate, optimizing performance by only updating the view when inputs change.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
  
  The application uses Angular Router with appropriate configurations in app-routing.module.ts and todos.module.ts, implementing hash-style URLs as specified.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The code follows Angular style guide conventions with appropriate module organization, naming conventions, and component structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
  
  The code uses strong typing with TypeScript interfaces (Todo, TodoState) and types (Filter) throughout the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
  
  All React JSX templates have been properly converted to Angular HTML templates with appropriate Angular directives and binding syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
  
  React event handlers have been replaced with Angular event bindings such as (click), (change), (input), etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs
  
  The provided code does not contain any TODO comments or unimplemented features.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules
  
  Lazy loading is implemented for the TodosModule in the app-routing.module.ts using the loadChildren function.
