# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items
  
  The TodoListComponent and TodoItemComponent properly render the todo items from the Store, and the TodoAppComponent subscribes to the selectVisibleTodos selector to get the filtered list of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented
  
  The adding functionality is properly implemented through the TodoInputComponent that emits an add event when Enter is pressed, which is caught by the TodoAppComponent that dispatches the addTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works
  
  The toggle functionality is implemented in the TodoItemComponent, which emits an event caught by TodoListComponent and passed to TodoAppComponent, which then dispatches the toggleTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented
  
  The editing functionality is implemented in the TodoItemComponent with double-click detection, inline editing, and proper focus management. It emits an update event that eventually triggers the updateTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented
  
  Deletion is implemented through the destroy button in TodoItemComponent that emits a remove event, which is caught and passed up to eventually dispatch the removeTodo action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented
  
  The toggleAll functionality is implemented in the TodoAppComponent template with the checkbox input that dispatches the toggleAll action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works
  
  Filtering is implemented through Angular Router routes with data properties defining the filter type, and the setFilter action is dispatched based on route data.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The TodoFooterComponent receives the activeCount input and displays it with the appropriate pluralization using the PluralizePipe.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items
  
  The clear completed button in TodoFooterComponent emits an event that is caught by TodoAppComponent, which dispatches the clearCompleted action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage
  
  Persistence is implemented through NgRx Effects that save todos to localStorage when actions that modify todos are dispatched and load todos from localStorage on application initialization.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation
  
  The application uses hash-style URLs (configured with useHash: true) to match the original React app's routing approach.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states
  
  The main section is only shown when there are todos, using *ngIf="(todos$ | async)?.length", and the footer only appears when there are active or completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly
  
  Form submissions (adding and editing todos) are properly handled with event handlers that prevent default behavior and process the input values appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships
  
  The application is well-structured with a container component (TodoAppComponent) and presentational components for each part of the UI, following Angular best practices for component composition.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved
  
  All functionality from the original TodoMVC application is implemented, including generation of UUIDs, filtering, toggling all, clearing completed todos, and local storage persistence.
