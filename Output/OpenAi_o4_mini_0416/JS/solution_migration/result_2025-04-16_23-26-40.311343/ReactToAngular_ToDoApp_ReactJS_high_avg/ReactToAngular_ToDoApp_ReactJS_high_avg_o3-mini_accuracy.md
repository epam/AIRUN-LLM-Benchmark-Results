# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The provided code and module setups (Angular Decorators, Angular CLI structure, etc.) conform to Angular 14.x conventions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The code imports and configures @ngrx/store in both the root (in AppModule) and feature modules using StoreModule.forRoot and StoreModule.forFeature.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  @ngrx/effects is properly set up in both the root (EffectsModule.forRoot) and in the TodosModule (EffectsModule.forFeature) with effects handling localStorage operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  The repository includes clearly defined actions (using createAction and props), a reducer (using createReducer, on), and selectors (using createSelector and createFeatureSelector).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  All components use the @Component decorator. Inputs and Outputs are properly declared (e.g., in TodoListComponent and TodoInputComponent).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  The code replaces React refs with Angular’s @ViewChild (e.g., in TodoInputComponent and TodoItemComponent) to access DOM elements.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  Component interactions are managed via @Input() and @Output() decorators, ensuring proper data flow and event emission between parent and child components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  Although the application does not have a large service layer, it utilizes the provided Utils class (registered in providers) and leverages @ngrx effects to handle data operations such as localStorage I/O. This is a valid application of Angular’s service concept.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  Dependency injection is evident through constructors in components and effects (e.g., Store and ActivatedRoute), and the Utils class is provided in the module.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  Several components use OnPush change detection to optimize performance, indicating proper use of Angular’s change detection strategies.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  The AppRoutingModule and TodosModule demonstrate routing configuration using Angular’s RouterModule with defined routes and hash-style URLs.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The code structure, file naming, folder organization, and component declarations adhere to established Angular style guidelines.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  Interfaces (e.g., Todo) and type aliases (e.g., Filter) are defined to enforce type safety, and actions, reducers, and selectors correctly reference these types.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  There is no JSX syntax present; all view templates are provided as Angular HTML templates (.html files).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  The code uses Angular event binding syntax (e.g., (click), (keydown), (input)) in place of React’s event handling system.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  No placeholder comments or TODO markers are found throughout the provided codebase.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  The TodosModule is configured to be lazy‑loaded via AppRoutingModule using loadChildren along with a feature-specific StoreModule and EffectsModule.
