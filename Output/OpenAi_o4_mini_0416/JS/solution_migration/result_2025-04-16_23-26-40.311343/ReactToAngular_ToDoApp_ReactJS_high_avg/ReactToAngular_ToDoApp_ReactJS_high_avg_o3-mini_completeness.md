# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The code uses the selector "selectVisibleTodos" and passes its results into the todo list component. This confirms that when the filter is 'all' the complete list of todos is displayed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoInputComponent listens for the Enter key, trims the input, and then triggers the add event. The parent component dispatches an addTodo action with a new ID generated via Utils.uuid. This implements adding a new todo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  Toggling is supported via a checkbox in the todo item component that triggers the onToggle() method. This method dispatches the toggleTodo action, and the reducer correctly flips the "completed" flag.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  The TodoItemComponent implements double-click editing, updates the view to an input field, and then handles onBlur/onKeydown events to submit an updated title or cancel editing. This clearly preserves editing functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  A button with the class "destroy" is connected to an onDestroy() event in the TodoItemComponent which dispatches a removeTodo action. Hence, deletion is properly implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  In the TodoAppComponent, a checkbox input with id "toggle-all" triggers toggleAll() with its checked status, dispatching the toggleAll action which updates all todos accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  The routing is configured to associate specific filter values (via route data) with each route. This filter value is then used by the selector "selectVisibleTodos" in combination with the "setFilter" action to display the appropriate todo items.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooterComponent is provided with "activeCount" via the activeCount$ observable from the store, and it correctly displays the number of items left.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The footer template contains a "Clear completed" button that emits an event and thereby dispatches the clearCompleted action. The reducer then filters out completed todos, effectively implementing this functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  The TodoEffects class implements two effects. One loads todos from local storage during app initialization and the other saves todos to local storage on any change-inducing action. This reliably persists the todo items between sessions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The AppRoutingModule configures routes using hash‑style URLs (via the { useHash: true } option). This ensures that the URL structure, for example "#/", "#/active", and "#/completed", remains consistent with the original configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  The main section displaying todos is wrapped in an *ngIf that checks for a non-empty todo list, while the footer is only shown when there is an active or completed count. These behaviors align with common practices for handling empty state UI in todo applications.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  The TodoInputComponent handles keydown events (specifically the Enter key) to capture and process user input, and resets the input field after submission. This guarantees correct handling of form submissions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The code follows a clear container–presentational (smart/dumb) architecture with appropriate use of Input, Output, and ViewChild bindings. Components like TodoAppComponent, TodoInputComponent, TodoListComponent, TodoItemComponent, and TodoFooterComponent interact as designed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  The provided Angular migration faithfully implements the core functionalities (adding, toggling, editing, deleting todos, filtering, and persistence) as well as adheres to Angular style guidelines. All critical business logic has been maintained.
