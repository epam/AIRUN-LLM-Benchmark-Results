# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
    
    The code clearly indicates it's using Angular 14 through its architecture, imports, and component structure. The title "TodoMVC Angular 14" in index.html also confirms this version.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS
    
    The code uses ES modules throughout with import/export statements, and there's no RequireJS configuration or usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management
    
    The application properly implements @ngrx/store through StoreModule.forRoot({ todo: todoReducer }) in the app.module.ts and uses store selectors and dispatches throughout the components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects
    
    @ngrx/effects is properly implemented with EffectsModule.forRoot([TodoEffects]) in app.module.ts, and the TodoEffects class handles localStorage interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management
    
    The code includes well-structured actions (todo.actions.ts), reducers (todo.reducer.ts), selectors (todo.selectors.ts), and effects (todo.effects.ts) for comprehensive todo management.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator
    
    Services like TodoStorageService are properly decorated with @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service
    
    The TodoStorageService handles localStorage operations with proper get() and set() methods, and the effects use this service for persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators
    
    All components (AppComponent, TodoAppComponent, TodoInputComponent, etc.) use proper @Component decorators with selector, templateUrl, and styleUrls.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators
    
    Both TodoFocusDirective and TodoEscapeDirective use proper @Directive decorators with appropriate selectors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)
    
    Angular template syntax is used correctly throughout, with examples like `*ngFor="let todo of todos"` and `*ngIf="!editing"`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))
    
    Event binding is used correctly with syntax like `(click)="remove.emit()"` and `(ngSubmit)="onSubmit()"`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])
    
    Property binding is used correctly with syntax like `[ngClass]="{ completed: todo.completed }"` and `[checked]="todo.completed"`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed
    
    Lifecycle hooks are implemented properly, such as ngOnInit() in AppComponent, TodoItemComponent, etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models
    
    The Todo interface is properly defined in models/todo.model.ts with appropriate properties.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services
    
    Dependency injection is used correctly in constructors, such as `constructor(private store: Store, private router: Router, private route: ActivatedRoute)`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions
    
    The code follows Angular style guide with proper naming conventions, folder structure, and component organization.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings
    
    The code appears well-structured and should run without errors, but since we don't have the actual running application to verify, we can't be 100% certain there are no runtime errors.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)
    
    TypeScript features are used appropriately with types, interfaces, generics, and type annotations throughout the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code
    
    The code appears clean without TODOs or commented-out code sections.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design
    
    Components have clear, focused responsibilities. For example, TodoItemComponent handles a single todo item's interactions, TodoListComponent manages the list, etc.
