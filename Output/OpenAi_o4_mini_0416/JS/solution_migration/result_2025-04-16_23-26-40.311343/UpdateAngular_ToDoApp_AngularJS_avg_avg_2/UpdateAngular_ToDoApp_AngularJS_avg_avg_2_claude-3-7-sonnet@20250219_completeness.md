- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list
  
  The application includes a component in the `components/todo-list` directory with appropriate files (`todo-list.component.ts`, `.html`, `.css`). The component is responsible for displaying the list of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos
  
  The application has a dedicated component in the `components/todo-input` directory that handles adding new todos with an event emitter for the add action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos
  
  The `todo-item.component.ts` includes functionality for editing todos with methods like `startEdit()`, `finishEdit()`, and `cancelEdit()`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos
  
  The filtering functionality is implemented within the `todo-footer.component.html` which contains filter links for "All", "Active", and "Completed".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics
  
  The `todo-footer.component.ts` receives and displays statistics like `remainingCount` and `completedCount`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos
  
  The `onAdd` method in `todo-app.component.ts` dispatches the `addTodo` action, and the corresponding reducer in `todo.reducer.ts` handles adding the new todo to the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos
  
  The application includes edit functionality in `todo-item.component.ts` and dispatches the `updateTodo` action through `onUpdate` in `todo-app.component.ts`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos
  
  The `onRemove` method in `todo-app.component.ts` dispatches the `removeTodo` action, and the reducer handles removing the todo from the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed
  
  The `onToggle` method in `todo-app.component.ts` dispatches the `toggleTodo` action, which updates the completed status in the reducer.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The application uses Angular's router to handle filter routes (`/`, `/active`, `/completed`) and the `selectFilteredTodos` selector to filter the todos accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete
  
  The `onToggleAll` method in `todo-app.component.ts` dispatches the `toggleAll` action, which is handled by the reducer to update all todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos
  
  The `onClearCompleted` method dispatches the `clearCompleted` action, and the reducer filters out completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos
  
  The `selectRemainingCount` selector in `todo.selectors.ts` calculates the count of remaining todos, which is displayed in the footer.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage
  
  The `TodoStorageService` handles saving todos to localStorage via the `set` method, and the `persistTodos$` effect ensures todos are saved after every state change.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization
  
  The `loadTodos$` effect in `todo.effects.ts` loads todos from localStorage when the application initializes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing
  
  The `TodoEscapeDirective` listens for the Escape key press and triggers the `escape` event, which is handled by the `cancelEdit` method in `todo-item.component.ts`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo
  
  The `TodoFocusDirective` sets focus on the input element when the `isFocused` input changes to true.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original
  
  The application imports the TodoMVC CSS files (`todomvc-common/base.css` and `todomvc-app-css/index.css`) and maintains the same HTML structure.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately
  
  In `todo-item.component.ts`, the `finishEdit` method checks if the title is empty and removes the todo if it is. In `todo-input.component.ts`, empty titles are not added.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter
  
  The application uses Angular Router with routes for `/`, `/active`, and `/completed`, which update the URL when different filters are selected.
