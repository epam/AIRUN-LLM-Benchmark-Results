# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The provided answer explicitly states that the migration targets Angular 14 and all modules and components reflect Angular 14 conventions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
  The code uses standard TypeScript/ES module syntax with import/export statements, indicating a clear migration away from RequireJS.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
  The application sets up state management using StoreModule.forRoot with a defined reducer, clearly showing @ngrx/store implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
  @ngrx/effects is integrated properly, as seen with the EffectsModule.forRoot and the TodoEffects class managing side effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
  The code includes a comprehensive set of NgRx actions, a reducer, selectors, and effects that cover the creation, update, removal, and persistence of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
  The TodoStorageService is correctly decorated with @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }) to ensure proper dependency injection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
  The TodoStorageService directly interacts with localStorage for storing and retrieving todo data.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
  All components (e.g., AppComponent, TodoAppComponent, TodoInputComponent, etc.) are correctly defined with the @Component decorator.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
  The custom directives (todoFocus and todoEscape) are properly implemented using the @Directive decorator.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
  Templates make use of Angular directives like *ngFor and *ngIf to handle dynamic rendering based on the component state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
  Event bindings in the templates, such as (click), (ngSubmit), and others (e.g., (dblclick)), follow the conventional Angular syntax.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
  Property bindings are correctly implemented using [ngClass] and other bracket syntaxes to bind class names and other properties.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
  Lifecycle hooks such as ngOnInit are used appropriately in the components (e.g., AppComponent, TodoAppComponent, TodoItemComponent).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
  The Todo data model is defined as a TypeScript interface, ensuring proper structure and type safety.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
  Components and services receive their dependencies (such as Store, Router, ActivatedRoute, etc.) via constructor injection.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The overall file and folder structure, naming conventions, and separation of concerns align well with the Angular Style Guide.  
  (I am slightly less than 100% confident because while the structure is well-organized, without executing linting tools, there might be minor deviations not evident from the provided code.)

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
  Based on the code quality and adherence to best practices, it is expected to run without console errors or warnings.  
  (The confidence is 80% because, as the code has not been executed, runtime issues or warnings cannot be completely ruled out.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
  The provided code effectively uses TypeScript features, including type annotations, interfaces, and proper module imports/exports.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
  There are only minimal comments for clarification; no TODOs or excessive commented-out code are present.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design  
  The application is broken down into small, focused components, services, and directives, each handling a specific aspect of the functionality, aligning well with the single responsibility principle.
