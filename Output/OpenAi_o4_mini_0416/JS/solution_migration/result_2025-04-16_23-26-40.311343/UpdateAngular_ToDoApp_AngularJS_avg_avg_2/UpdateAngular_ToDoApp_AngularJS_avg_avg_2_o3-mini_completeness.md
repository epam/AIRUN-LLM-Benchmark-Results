# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list  
  The TodoListComponent (see Step 12) clearly provides a component dedicated to displaying the list of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos  
  The TodoInputComponent (see Step 11) is responsible for adding new todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos  
  The TodoItemComponent (see Step 13) incorporates editing functionality with methods to start, finish, and cancel editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos  
  The TodoFooterComponent (see Step 14) displays filtering options (All, Active, Completed), and the TodoAppComponent manages the filter state via Angular Router.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics  
  The TodoFooterComponent (see Step 14) displays the remaining todos count and is connected to the corresponding selector in the store.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos  
  The integration between TodoInputComponent’s (Step 11) onSubmit method and the dispatch of addTodo in TodoAppComponent confirms this functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos  
  The TodoItemComponent (Step 13) supports editing an existing todo, including updating or removing the todo if the edit results in an empty title.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos  
  The remove functionality is implemented in the TodoItemComponent (Step 13) and handled by corresponding actions and reducers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed  
  The toggle functionality in TodoItemComponent (Step 13) allows marking todos as completed (or not) through the dispatch of toggleTodo.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)  
  The filtering logic is implemented in the TodoAppComponent (Step 10) using Angular Router changes, which then select the appropriate list via selectors (Step 5).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete  
  The TodoAppComponent template (Step 10) has an input checkbox for toggling all todos, which dispatches the toggleAll action.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos  
  The clearCompleted functionality is connected to the TodoFooterComponent (Step 14) and is handled by the corresponding action and reducer.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos  
  The remainingCount is provided through the store’s selector and displayed in the TodoFooterComponent (Step 14).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage  
  The TodoStorageService (Step 6) and the persistTodos$ effect in TodoEffects (Step 7) ensure that todos are saved to localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization  
  The AppComponent (Step 9) dispatches loadTodos on initialization, and the corresponding effect in TodoEffects (Step 7) loads the persisted todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing  
  The custom todoEscape directive (Step 15b) listens for the Escape key and triggers the cancelEdit method in TodoItemComponent.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo  
  The custom todoFocus directive (Step 15a) defers focus to the input element when editing is initiated.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original  
  The application imports the TodoMVC CSS (Step 16) and follows TodoMVC’s structural patterns.  
  (The confidence is 90% because while the CSS files are included and structure is preserved, the exact visual fidelity would require a runtime verification.)

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately  
  The TodoInputComponent (Step 11) and the editing logic in TodoItemComponent (Step 13) both trim the title and prevent adding or updating with an empty value, with a removal as fallback in the edit scenario.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter  
  The Angular Router setup in AppModule (Step 8) and the filter handling in TodoAppComponent (Step 10) ensure that URLs reflect the selected filter (e.g., "/", "/active", "/completed").
