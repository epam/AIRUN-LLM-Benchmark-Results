# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed
  
  The TodoApp.tsx file includes a handleNewKey function that checks for the Enter key and dispatches an addTodo action when the key is pressed, along with validation that the input is not empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter
  
  The TodoApp component correctly filters todos based on the selected filter (ALL_TODOS, ACTIVE_TODOS, COMPLETED_TODOS) and renders the filtered items using the shown variable.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos
  
  The application includes a toggle-all checkbox in TodoApp.tsx with the handleToggleAll function that dispatches the toggleAll action to mark all todos as complete or incomplete.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted
  
  The TodoItem component includes functionality for all three operations: toggling via the checkbox, editing via double-click, and deleting via the destroy button.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode
  
  The TodoItem component has an onDoubleClick handler on the label that triggers the onEdit function, which in turn dispatches the setEditing action to enable editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo
  
  The TodoItem component includes a handleKey function that checks for the Enter key and calls handleSubmit to save the edited todo when Enter is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value
  
  The handleKey function in TodoItem also checks for the Escape key, resets the text to the original todo title, and calls onCancel to exit editing mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items
  
  The TodoFooter component receives the count of active items and displays it with the appropriate singular/plural form of "item".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The TodoFooter component includes links for all three filters with appropriate handlers to change the filter and update the URL hash.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos
  
  The TodoFooter component includes a "Clear completed" button that calls the onClearCompleted handler when clicked, which dispatches the clearCompleted action.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence
  
  The application uses loadState and saveState functions in localStorage.ts to persist the todos state to localStorage, and the store subscribes to changes to save state updates.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state
  
  The TodoApp component conditionally renders the main section and footer based on the presence of todos, and the TodoFooter conditionally renders the "Clear completed" button.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count
  
  The TodoFooter component uses the count to determine if "item" or "items" should be displayed: `const itemWord = count === 1 ? 'item' : 'items';`

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components
  
  The application is split into several focused components (TodoApp, TodoItem, TodoFooter) that each handle specific responsibilities, promoting good component composition.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality
  
  The files are organized in a feature-based structure, with directories for features (todos) and common utilities, and files within those directories focusing on specific aspects (types, slice, components).
