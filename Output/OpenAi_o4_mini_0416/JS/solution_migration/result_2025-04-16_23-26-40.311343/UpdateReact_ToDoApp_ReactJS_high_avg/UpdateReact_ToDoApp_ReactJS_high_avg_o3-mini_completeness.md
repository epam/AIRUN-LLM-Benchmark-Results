# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The TodoApp componentâ€™s input field has an onKeyDown event handler ("handleNewKey") that checks if the key pressed is "Enter". If so, it trims the input and dispatches the addTodo action. This confirms that new todos are created when Enter is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  The code filters the todos based on the current filter value (ALL_TODOS, ACTIVE_TODOS, COMPLETED_TODOS) before mapping them to TodoItem components. This satisfies the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  The application includes a checkbox with an onChange handler (handleToggleAll) that dispatches the toggleAll action. This allows toggling the completion status of all todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  Each TodoItem receives callback props: onToggle (to toggle completion), onEdit (to initiate editing), and onDestroy (to delete), fulfilling this functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  In the TodoItem component, a double-click on the label triggers the onEdit callback, enabling edit mode, which matches the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  The TodoItem component listens for the Enter key in its onKeyDown handler. When Enter is pressed during editing, it calls handleSubmit, which in turn dispatches the saveTodo action, thus submitting the edit.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  The onKeyDown event in TodoItem checks for the Escape key. When Escape is pressed, it resets the local text state to the original todo title and calls onCancel, thereby cancelling edits.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  The TodoFooter component receives a "count" prop (activeCount) and displays it in a span within the "todo-count" element, accurately showing the number of active items.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  TodoFooter renders filter links ("All", "Active", "Completed") with onClick handlers that update the filter when selected. This meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  The TodoFooter component conditionally renders a "Clear completed" button when there are completed todos, which calls onClearCompleted when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  The store configuration includes functions loadState and saveState. The state is loaded from localStorage during initialization and is saved on every state change, ensuring persistence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  The application conditionally renders sections (such as the todo list and footer) based on the state (for example, checking if todos.length > 0 or if there are active/completed todos).

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  The TodoFooter component determines the word ("item" vs. "items") based on whether the count equals 1, ensuring correct pluralization.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The application is divided into a clear component hierarchy: App.tsx wraps TodoApp with Suspense for code splitting; TodoApp handles the main logic; and TodoItem and TodoFooter handle individual todo item display and footer functionality respectively.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The file structure clearly separates concerns (common utilities and constants in a separate folder, todos-related components and slices in the features/todos folder), demonstrating a well-organized project structure.
