# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration
  
  The code clearly shows it was bootstrapped with `npx create-react-app virtual-piano --template typescript` and uses React 18 features such as `ReactDOM.createRoot()` instead of the older `ReactDOM.render()` method.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure
  
  The code defines TypeScript interfaces and types in `src/types.ts` and uses them throughout the application. It includes `Note` type, `KeyData` interface, and typed records like `SOUND_MAP: Record<Note, HTMLAudioElement>`.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks
  
  All components (App, Piano, Key, ToggleButtons, FullscreenButton) are implemented as functional components with the React.FC type annotation. The App component uses hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useCallback.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)
  
  The App component manages state using useState for `showLetters` and `activeNotes`. The useEffect hook is used to handle keyboard events, and useCallback is used for the `handlePlay` and `handleReset` functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels
  
  Keyboard event handlers are implemented at the App level using useEffect, which is appropriate since it's a global functionality. The handlers correctly map keyboard keys to notes and trigger the play/reset functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events
  
  The Key component properly implements mouse events using React synthetic events: `onMouseDown`, `onMouseUp`, `onMouseLeave`, and `onMouseEnter` with a check for mouse buttons to handle drag functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment
  
  Audio resources are handled through the SOUND_MAP in utils.ts, which creates Audio objects with proper paths using process.env.PUBLIC_URL to ensure compatibility with different React environments.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility
  
  The FullscreenButton component implements fullscreen functionality using standard browser APIs (requestFullscreen/exitFullscreen) with proper error handling using .catch(), following React patterns.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns
  
  Components like Key and ToggleButtons use conditional class application through template literals or building class lists programmatically, which follows React patterns for dynamic class assignment.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate
  
  React.memo is used appropriately on leaf components like Key, ToggleButtons, Piano, and FullscreenButton to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations
  
  Audio playback is handled correctly with the useCallback hook in the App component. The application resets currentTime before playing sounds and properly manages the active notes state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application
  
  The code consistently uses TypeScript typing throughout, with explicit types for props, state, and event handlers. It properly handles nullable types with non-null assertions where appropriate (e.g., `k.note!`).
