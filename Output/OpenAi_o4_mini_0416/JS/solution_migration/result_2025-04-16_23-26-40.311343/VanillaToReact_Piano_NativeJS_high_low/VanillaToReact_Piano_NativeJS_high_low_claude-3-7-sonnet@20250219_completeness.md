# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'
  
  The `App.tsx` component clearly renders a header with the class "header" containing an h1 element with class "header-title" and the text "Virtual Piano".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons
  
  The `ToggleButtons.tsx` component renders a div with class "btn-container" containing two buttons labeled "Notes" and "Letters", which toggle between showing notes or letters on the piano keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)
  
  The `Piano.tsx` component renders all the piano keys using the WHITE_KEYS and BLACK_KEYS arrays from utils.ts, creating a complete piano keyboard with both natural (white) and sharp (black) keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes
  
  In the `Key.tsx` component, each piano key div is created with data-letter and data-note attributes that are set based on the props passed to the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked
  
  The application uses the SOUND_MAP in utils.ts to associate each note with the correct audio file, and the handlePlay function in App.tsx ensures the sound is played when a key is clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)
  
  The `Key.tsx` component adds the "piano-key-active" class to keys that are active (when the active prop is true), which would highlight the pressed keys based on the CSS.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes
  
  The App.tsx component includes keyboard event listeners in a useEffect hook that map keyboard keys to notes using the LETTER_TO_NOTE mapping and trigger the handlePlay and handleReset functions accordingly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked
  
  The App.tsx component maintains a showLetters state variable that is toggled by the ToggleButtons component, and this state is passed to the Piano component to determine what to display.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes
  
  The FullscreenButton.tsx component includes functionality to toggle fullscreen mode using the standard browser fullscreen API, with proper error handling.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly
  
  The App.tsx component maintains an activeNotes array state that can contain multiple notes, and the handlePlay function adds notes to this array if they're not already present, allowing for multiple simultaneous key presses.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys
  
  The Key.tsx component includes an onMouseEnter handler that checks if the mouse button is pressed (e.buttons === 1) and plays the note if it is, enabling drag functionality across keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information
  
  The App.tsx component renders a footer with class "footer" containing a div with class "footer-container" and the text "2020".
