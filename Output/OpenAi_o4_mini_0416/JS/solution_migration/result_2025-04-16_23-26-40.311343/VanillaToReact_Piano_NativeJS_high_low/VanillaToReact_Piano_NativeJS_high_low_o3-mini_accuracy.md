# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration  
  The provided answer explicitly states it was bootstrapped with "npx create-react-app virtual-piano --template typescript" and uses React 18 in all components.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure  
  The code defines strict TS types (e.g., the "Note" type and "KeyData" interface) and uses these types in the audio mapping (SOUND_MAP) and other parts of the application.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks  
  All components (App, ToggleButtons, Piano, Key, FullscreenButton) are implemented as functional components. Hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useCallback are used appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)  
  State is managed correctly using useState (for UI state like showLetters and activeNotes), and useEffect is used for lifecycle operations like setting up and cleaning up keyboard event listeners.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels  
  The App component attaches keyboard event listeners to the window inside a useEffect hook, ensuring that key events are handled at a global level.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events  
  In the Key component, mouse events (onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseLeave, onMouseEnter) are correctly implemented using React synthetic event handlers to manage interactive states.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment  
  Audio objects are instantiated once in the utils file and reused. The code handles playing and resetting audio via state updates and event-driven methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility  
  The FullscreenButton component uses React's event handling and standard browser API methods (requestFullscreen and exitFullscreen) with error catches to support browser compatibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns  
  Components (e.g., Key and Piano) conditionally build their class lists based on state and props using array joins, which is a common and acceptable React pattern.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate  
  Components such as ToggleButtons, Piano, Key, and FullscreenButton are wrapped with React.memo, ensuring they avoid unnecessary re-renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations  
  Audio playback is triggered through callbacks (handlePlay and handleReset) that properly interact with React state, ensuring audio is not re-instantiated unnecessarily across renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application  
  The application uses TypeScript across all files, employing strict interfaces and types (such as for notes, key data, props, etc.) without any use of "any", which confirms full strict typing practices.
