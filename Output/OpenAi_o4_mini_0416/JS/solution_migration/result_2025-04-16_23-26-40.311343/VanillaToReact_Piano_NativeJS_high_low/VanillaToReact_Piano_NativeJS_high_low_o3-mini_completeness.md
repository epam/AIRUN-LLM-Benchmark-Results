# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'  
  The header is defined in App.tsx with:  
  <header className="header">
    <h1 className="header-title">Virtual Piano</h1>
  </header>

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons  
  The ToggleButtons component includes two buttons labeled "Notes" and "Letters" within a container with class "btn-container".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)  
  The Piano component maps over WHITE_KEYS and BLACK_KEYS arrays to render all keys. Each key is rendered by the Key component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes  
  The Key component adds data attributes such as data-letter and data-note for each key based on the provided props.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked  
  The handlePlay function in App.tsx uses the SOUND_MAP and invokes the play() method on the corresponding audio object when a piano key is activated. Although the mapping of file names (e.g. note 'c' using "a.mp3") might appear unusual, it is consistent in the provided code and is assumed intentional.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)  
  Active keys are managed via the activeNotes state in App.tsx and passed to the Key component. The Key component adds the "piano-key-active" class when the key is active.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes  
  Keyboard events are handled in App.tsx by listening for keydown and keyup events and mapping them to notes using LETTER_TO_NOTE.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked  
  The ToggleButtons component toggles the showLetters state, which is used in the Piano component to apply the "letters" class conditionally.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes  
  The FullscreenButton component toggles fullscreen mode by calling document.documentElement.requestFullscreen() and document.exitFullscreen() based on the current fullscreen state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly  
  The application maintains an array of activeNotes and, by checking for duplicates before adding a note, it supports multiple keys being played at the same time.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys  
  Mouse event handlers in the Key component (onMouseEnter, onMouseDown, onMouseUp, and onMouseLeave) support dragging over keys to play them.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information  
  The App.tsx file contains a footer element that displays the year "2020".
