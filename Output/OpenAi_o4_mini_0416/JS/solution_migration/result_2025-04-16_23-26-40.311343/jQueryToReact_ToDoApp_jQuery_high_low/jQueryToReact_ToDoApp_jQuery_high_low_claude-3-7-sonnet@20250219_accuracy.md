# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18.x
  
  The code explicitly imports React DOM client API from React 18 in index.tsx:
  ```tsx
  import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
    document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement
  )
  ```
  This `createRoot` API is specific to React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript for type safety
  
  All files have TypeScript extensions (.ts or .tsx) and use strong typing throughout, including type definitions, interfaces, and proper type annotations.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for state management
  
  The code uses Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` in todosSlice.ts:
  ```ts
  import { createSlice, PayloadAction } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
  
  const todosSlice = createSlice({
    name: 'todos',
    initialState: [] as TodosState,
    reducers: {
      // reducers defined here
    }
  })
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm nanoid is used for generating unique IDs
  
  The code imports and uses nanoid for generating unique IDs in the prepare callback of the addTodo reducer:
  ```ts
  import { nanoid } from 'nanoid'
  
  prepare(title: string) {
    return { payload: { id: nanoid(), title, completed: false } }
  }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code uses functional components with hooks instead of class components
  
  All components are implemented as functional components with React hooks:
  ```tsx
  const Header: React.FC = () => {
    const [title, setTitle] = useState('')
    // ...
  }
  ```
  The code uses useState, useRef, useEffect, and custom hooks like useAppDispatch and useAppSelector.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application maintains the same routing functionality with proper route handling
  
  The code uses React Router v6 with proper route handling:
  ```tsx
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<Navigate to="/all" replace />} />
    <Route path="/:filter" element={<TodoApp />} />
    <Route path="*" element={<Navigate to="/all" replace />} />
  </Routes>
  ```
  It correctly implements hash-based routing with HashRouter and handles the three required filters (all, active, completed).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the Redux store is properly configured with appropriate slices
  
  The store is properly configured in store.ts using configureStore:
  ```ts
  export const store = configureStore({
    reducer: {
      todos: todosReducer,
    },
    preloadedState: {
      todos: loadTodos(),
    },
  })
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the Redux provider is set up in the application entry point
  
  The Redux Provider is properly set up in index.tsx:
  ```tsx
  root.render(
    <Provider store={store}>
      <HashRouter>
        <App />
      </HashRouter>
    </Provider>
  )
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for all data structures
  
  The code properly defines TypeScript interfaces and types, such as:
  ```ts
  export interface Todo {
    id: string
    title: string
    completed: boolean
  }
  
  type TodosState = Todo[]
  export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>
  export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the code follows React best practices for component composition
  
  The code follows best practices by:
  - Breaking down the UI into logical components (Header, Footer, TodoList, TodoItem)
  - Keeping components focused on a single responsibility
  - Using proper prop types
  - Implementing custom hooks like useAppDispatch and useAppSelector

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles keyboard events properly
  
  The application correctly handles keyboard events:
  ```tsx
  // For adding new todos in Header.tsx
  const handleKeyUp = (e: KeyboardEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    if (e.key === 'Enter' && title.trim()) {
      dispatch(addTodo(title.trim()))
      setTitle('')
    }
  }
  
  // For editing todos in TodoItem.tsx
  const handleKeyDown = (e: KeyboardEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    if (e.key === 'Enter') {
      inputRef.current?.blur()
    }
    if (e.key === 'Escape') {
      setDraft(todo.title)
      setEditing(false)
    }
  }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application maintains local storage persistence
  
  Local storage persistence is implemented in store.ts:
  ```ts
  function loadTodos() {
    try {
      const serialized = localStorage.getItem(LOCALSTORAGE_KEY)
      return serialized ? JSON.parse(serialized) : []
    } catch {
      return []
    }
  }
  
  store.subscribe(() => {
    try {
      const state = store.getState()
      localStorage.setItem(LOCALSTORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify(state.todos))
    } catch {}
  })
  ```

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  The code doesn't contain any obvious errors or issues that would generate console errors. There are no direct console.log statements or deprecated API usage. However, without actually running the code, it's not possible to be 100% certain there are no runtime errors.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the application implements proper error handling
  
  The code implements basic error handling for local storage operations using try/catch blocks:
  ```ts
  try {
    const serialized = localStorage.getItem(LOCALSTORAGE_KEY)
    return serialized ? JSON.parse(serialized) : []
  } catch {
    return []
  }
  ```
  However, there could be more comprehensive error handling in certain places, particularly for user interactions.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm the code is optimized with no unnecessary re-renders
  
  The code appears to be optimized with:
  - Memoized selectors using createSelector
  - Proper use of Redux for state management
  - Clean component structures
  
  However, without performance profiling, it's difficult to be 100% certain there are no unnecessary re-renders in all edge cases.
