- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the React setup includes necessary entry points and proper component structure
  
  The project has a proper React setup with `main.tsx` as the entry point, `App.tsx` as the main component, and organized component hierarchy with separate directories for components and pages.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that Redux is implemented with appropriate store configuration, reducers, and actions
  
  Redux is properly implemented using Redux Toolkit with a store configuration in `store/index.ts` and a slice for counter functionality in `store/slices/counterSlice.ts`. The implementation includes proper typing with RootState and AppDispatch types.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify React Router is correctly configured with defined routes and navigation components
