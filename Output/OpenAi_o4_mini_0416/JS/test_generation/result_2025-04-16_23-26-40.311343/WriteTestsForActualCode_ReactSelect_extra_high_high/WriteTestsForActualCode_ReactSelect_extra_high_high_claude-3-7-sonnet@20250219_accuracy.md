# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up in the test file
  
  The test file correctly imports and uses Jest and React Testing Library. The imports include `render`, `screen`, `fireEvent`, `within`, and `act` from @testing-library/react. The test structure follows Jest conventions with `describe` and `test` blocks.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test cases are properly isolated and do not have interdependencies
  
  Each test case is self-contained with its own render call and assertions. Tests appropriately use mock functions (jest.fn()) for callbacks like onChange, onMenuOpen, etc., allowing isolation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that DOM events are simulated using proper React Testing Library methods
  
  The test file correctly uses fireEvent methods for different interactions:
  - `fireEvent.mouseDown()` for clicking the select control
  - `fireEvent.keyDown()` for keyboard navigation
  - `fireEvent.click()` for option selection
  - `fireEvent.change()` for input changes

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that accessibility attributes are being tested appropriately
  
  Tests properly check accessibility attributes such as:
  - aria-expanded
  - aria-labelledby
  - aria-disabled
  - Role attributes (combobox, listbox)

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure mocks are used for external dependencies where appropriate
  
  The code includes a section for mocking expensive or environment-specific utils:
  ```js
  // __mocks__/utils.ts
  export const isTouchCapable = () => false;
  export const isMobileDevice = () => false;
  export const scrollIntoView = jest.fn();
  export const noop = () => {};
  ```
  These are correctly configured in jest.config.js with moduleNameMapper.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify proper use of async/await for asynchronous testing where needed
  
  The test file doesn't explicitly use async/await or handle Promise-based asynchronous operations. While it does use `act` from React Testing Library (which helps with async updates), there are no clear examples of async test cases or waiting for async operations to complete using waitFor or findBy queries.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all assertions use appropriate Jest matchers
  
  The test file uses appropriate Jest matchers:
  - `expect().toHaveAttribute()`
  - `expect().toBeInTheDocument()`
  - `expect().toHaveClass()`
  - `expect().toHaveBeenCalled()`
  - `expect().toBeNull()`
  - `expect().toHaveValue()`
  - `expect().toBeLessThan()` for performance testing

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that tests include proper cleanup after each test case
  
  The test file doesn't explicitly use afterEach or cleanup functions to ensure test isolation. React Testing Library's render function automatically handles cleanup between tests when using modern versions of the library, but there's no explicit mention of this or implementation of cleanup for custom resources.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test descriptions clearly indicate what functionality is being tested
  
  The test file organizes tests into clear descriptive blocks:
  - "Select – Rendering and accessibility"
  - "Select – Opening/closing and menu options"
  - "Select – Keyboard interaction"
  - "Select – Mouse interaction"
  - "Select – Controlled behavior"
  - "Select – Edge cases & performance"
  
  Each test case has a clear description that indicates what specific functionality is being tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the test file follows best practices for organizing test cases (describe/it blocks)
  
  The test file is well-organized with logical grouping of tests into describe blocks based on functionality categories. Each test has a clear description and tests a specific aspect of the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that all event handlers are tested using appropriate simulation methods
  
  The test file validates various event handlers:
  - onChange 
  - onMenuOpen/onMenuClose
  - onInputChange
  
  These are tested with appropriate event simulations and assertions on the mock functions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the test environment correctly simulates both mouse and keyboard interactions
  
  The test file includes both mouse interactions:
  - fireEvent.mouseDown for opening the menu
  - fireEvent.click for selecting options
  
  And keyboard interactions:
  - fireEvent.keyDown with various keys (ArrowDown, ArrowUp, Enter, Backspace, Escape)

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for touch events properly simulate mobile interactions
  
  While the test file includes mocks for `isTouchCapable` and `isMobileDevice`, it doesn't include any specific tests that simulate touch events or mobile interactions. There are no examples of testing touch-specific behaviors like tapping, swiping, or other mobile interactions.
