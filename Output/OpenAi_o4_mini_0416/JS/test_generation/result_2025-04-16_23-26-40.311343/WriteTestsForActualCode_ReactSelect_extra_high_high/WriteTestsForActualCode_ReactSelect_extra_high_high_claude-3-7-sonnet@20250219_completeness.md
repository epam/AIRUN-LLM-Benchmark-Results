# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present
- **Pass** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented
- **Fail** (90%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality

    While the provided tests include setup for filtering (with `filterOption: null` in the default props), there are no explicit tests that verify the filtering behavior when a user types in the input. The test suite doesn't demonstrate that typing "ap" would filter to show only "Apple" in the options list, for example.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist

    While there is a comment in section 4 mentioning "For multi-select flows, render with `isMulti: true`", the actual test code doesn't include any tests with `isMulti: true` that verify multi-select functionality such as selecting multiple items, removing individual items, etc.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested
- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states
- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance
- **Fail** (95%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested

    While the test suite covers some focus-related functionality (like keyboard navigation), it lacks comprehensive tests for focus management across different interactions, particularly focus retention after option selection, blur behavior, and focus handling with screen readers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering
- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations

    While `formatOptionLabel` is included in the default props as `undefined`, there are no tests that specifically verify that custom format functions work correctly when provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)
- **Fail** (95%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)

    The test suite tests loading indicators through the loading message, but doesn't explicitly test the rendering and functionality of other indicator components like the dropdown indicator or clear indicator.
