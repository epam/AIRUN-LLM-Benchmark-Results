# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up in the test file  
  The provided answer includes installation instructions, configuration files (jest.config.js, jest.setup.ts), and import statements for '@testing-library/react' and '@testing-library/jest-dom', indicating a proper setup.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test cases are properly isolated and do not have interdependencies  
  The tests are organized into distinct describe blocks with each test using its own render calls (or rerender patterns) that maintain isolation. There is no evidence of interdependencies between tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that DOM events are simulated using proper React Testing Library methods  
  The tests use appropriate methods like fireEvent.mouseDown, fireEvent.keyDown, fireEvent.click, etc., which are standard for simulating DOM events in React Testing Library.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that accessibility attributes are being tested appropriately  
  The tests specifically check for aria attributes (e.g., aria-expanded, aria-labelledby) and the presence of expected elements (e.g., role="combobox", role="listbox"), ensuring accessibility is verified.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure mocks are used for external dependencies where appropriate  
  The answer demonstrates mocking in external dependencies—for example, a __mocks__/utils.ts file is provided and referenced in the configuration, ensuring that expensive operations or environment-specific utilities are properly mocked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of async/await for asynchronous testing where needed  
  Although the test suite does not include asynchronous operations (and thus does not show async/await usage), it is appropriate for the synchronous tests presented. No asynchronous operations are required in the current scenarios.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all assertions use appropriate Jest matchers  
  The provided tests use standard and appropriate Jest matchers such as toHaveAttribute, toBeInTheDocument, toHaveBeenCalled, and expect.any(Object), which correctly confirm the expected behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that tests include proper cleanup after each test case  
  React Testing Library automatically cleans up after each test, and the test file follows common patterns without requiring explicit clean-up code. This adheres to best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test descriptions clearly indicate what functionality is being tested  
  Each test and describe block includes clear, descriptive titles (e.g., "renders a combobox with correct aria attributes when closed", "applies provided id, className and aria-labelledby props"), which clearly communicate the functionality being verified.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the test file follows best practices for organizing test cases (describe/it blocks)  
  The tests are well-organized into logical describe blocks that group related tests by concern (rendering, interaction, controlled behavior, etc.), aligning with recommended best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that all event handlers are tested using appropriate simulation methods  
  Event handlers are properly simulated using fireEvent (for mouse and keyboard events), and the tests confirm handler invocation (e.g., using expect(onMenuOpen).toHaveBeenCalled()) with appropriate event simulation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the test environment correctly simulates both mouse and keyboard interactions  
  The test suite includes simulation of mouse (click events) and keyboard interactions (ArrowDown, ArrowUp, Enter, Escape, Backspace), ensuring comprehensive coverage of both input methods.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for touch events properly simulate mobile interactions  
  There are no tests present that simulate touch events. Although the setup includes a mock for touch‑capability detection and related utilities, no explicit touch interaction tests (e.g., using touch event simulation methods) are provided.  
  This is a gap since the evaluation step specifically requires tests for mobile (touch) interactions.
