# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist  
  The test suite includes a "Rendering and accessibility" block with tests checking the rendering of the combobox and placeholder, confirming that basic rendering is covered.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present  
  The suite tests navigation with ArrowDown/ArrowUp, Enter, Escape, and Backspace. However, there is no explicit test for the Tab key. The overall keyboard navigation is mostly covered, hence a slight deduction in confidence.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)  
  While there is a test for clicking (selecting an option on click), there are no tests that verify hover interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior  
  The tests include specific blocks for controlled behavior (e.g. controlled menuIsOpen, controlled inputValue) as well as defaults through the makeProps function.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values  
  The suite tests selecting (via keyboard and clicking) and clearing (with Backspace) values. However, there is no explicit test for the removal of selected values (especially in a multi-select context).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented  
  There are tests that open the menu on click and close it with Escape, as well as controlled tests confirming the menu does not open when menuIsOpen is set to false.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality  
  No tests are provided that verify how options are filtered or how the search functionality behaves (e.g. responding to input changes).

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist  
  All tests appear to be written for single-select or non-multi scenarios. There is no test case that specifically addresses multi-select behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility  
  The tests check for aria-expanded, aria-labelledby, and the presence of a live region message for screen readers, ensuring accessibility attributes are validated.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested  
  There is a test that confirms the "No options" message is rendered when the options list is empty.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states  
  A test is provided for the loading state (showing a loading message). However, there is no test for handling error states.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states  
  The suite includes a test that handles a disabled option, verifying the correct ARIA attribute and preventing selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance  
  There is a performance test that renders 1000 options and measures the rendering time.

- **Fail** (80%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested  
  Although keyboard interactions are simulated, there are no explicit assertions verifying changes in focus management (e.g. checking document.activeElement). There is indirect evidence through event simulation, but explicit checks are missing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering  
  Tests confirm that the placeholder is rendered and that controlled values appear in the input.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations  
  Even though the prop for a custom formatOptionLabel is accepted in the default props, there is no dedicated test that validates its behavior.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)  
  The tests thoroughly invoke and verify the callback functions for selection changes, input changes, and menu open/close events.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)  
  While a loading indicator is indirectly tested via the loading message and the clearing behavior is partly tested via the Backspace key, there are no explicit tests for indicator components such as dropdown icons or clear buttons.
