# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)
  
  The code clearly uses Jasmine as the testing framework and Karma as the test runner. This is evident from the package.json dependencies (jasmine-core, karma, karma-jasmine) and the karma.conf.js configuration file which specifies 'jasmine' as the framework.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints
  
  The tests properly mock REST API endpoints using AngularJS's $httpBackend service in the REST Factory test. For example, the tests mock GET, PUT, and query operations on various endpoints like 'api/blocks/5' and verify the expected responses.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation
  
  All test suites use beforeEach hooks to set up the test environment, and the REST Factory test also uses afterEach to verify no outstanding HTTP requests remain, ensuring proper test isolation:
  ```javascript
  afterEach(function() {
    // verify we flushed all requests
    $httpBackend.verifyNoOutstandingExpectation();
    $httpBackend.verifyNoOutstandingRequest();
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls
  
  All HTTP requests are properly mocked using $httpBackend in the REST Factory tests. Additionally, the PageCtrl tests mock the REST service entirely with jasmine spies, ensuring no real API calls are made during testing.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection
  
  The tests properly use AngularJS dependency injection to inject services. For example:
  ```javascript
  beforeEach(inject(function(_REST_, _$httpBackend_) {
    REST = _REST_;
    $httpBackend = _$httpBackend_;
  }));
  ```
  The naming convention with underscores (_SERVICE_) is a standard practice for AngularJS dependency injection in tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations
  
  The tests handle promises and asynchronous operations correctly. For example, the PageCtrl tests mock $translate to return a promise and use $rootScope.$apply() to resolve it:
  ```javascript
  $translate = jasmine.createSpy('$translate').and.callFake(function(key) {
    var d = $q.defer();
    d.resolve(key + "_translated");
    return d.promise;
  });
  ```
  And later resolve it with:
  ```javascript
  $rootScope.$apply();
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies
  
  The tests make extensive use of spies and mocks for external dependencies. For example, localStorage is mocked with spies:
  ```javascript
  spyOn(window.localStorage, 'getItem').and.callFake(function(k){
    return store[k] || null;
  });
  ```
  And REST methods are mocked with jasmine spies:
  ```javascript
  REST = {
    content: { delete: jasmine.createSpy(), save: jasmine.createSpy(), update: jasmine.createSpy() },
    // ...other mocks
  };
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization
  
  All tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization. Each test suite has a main describe block (e.g., "REST Factory", "pageCtrl") containing multiple it blocks that clearly describe what's being tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls
  
  The tests cover both success and error scenarios. For example, the PageCtrl tests specifically test error branches in the savePage method:
  ```javascript
  describe('savePage error branches', function() {
    // Error tests for different scenarios
  });
  ```
  And the autocompleteTags test covers both success and error scenarios:
  ```javascript
  it('autocompleteTags() on success fills suggestions', function() {
    // Success scenario
  });

  it('autocompleteTags() on error clears suggestions', function() {
    // Error scenario
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate
  
  The tests simulate user interactions where appropriate. For example, the PageCtrl tests simulate user actions like changing the title, URL, and description, as well as selecting suggestions:
  ```javascript
  it('titleChange() should slugify title when url empty', function() {
    $scope.page.title = 'Hello World!';
    $scope.page.url = '';
    $scope.titleChange();
    // ... assertions
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage
  
  The tests properly clean up after execution. The localStorage mock is reset before each test:
  ```javascript
  beforeEach(function(){ store = {}; });
  ```
  And the REST factory tests verify no outstanding HTTP requests remain:
  ```javascript
  afterEach(function() {
    $httpBackend.verifyNoOutstandingExpectation();
    $httpBackend.verifyNoOutstandingRequest();
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested
  
  The tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested. For example:
  ```javascript
  it('should define blocks resource and GET a block by ID', function() {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('deletePage() should invoke REST deletes and navigate to new', function() {
    // Test implementation
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible
  
  The tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible. For example, the PageCtrl tests validate the effects of functions like titleChange() on the model:
  ```javascript
  it('titleChange() should slugify title when url empty', function() {
    $scope.page.title = 'Hello World!';
    $scope.page.url = '';
    $scope.titleChange();
    expect(Page.title).toBe('Hello World!');
    expect($scope.page.url).toBe('hello-world');
    expect(Page.url).toBe('hello-world');
  });
  ```
