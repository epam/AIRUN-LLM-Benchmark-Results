# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use a modern JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)  
  The provided answer uses Jasmine for writing tests and Karma for running them, which are modern and widely used frameworks in the JavaScript ecosystem.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that tests properly mock $resource and handle REST API endpoints  
  The tests appropriately simulate REST API endpoints by using $httpBackend in the REST factory tests and stubbing REST methods in the controller tests to avoid actual API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use beforeEach/afterEach hooks for proper test isolation  
  All test suites make proper use of beforeEach (and afterEach where needed, e.g., to flush $httpBackend) ensuring that each test is isolated from others.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all HTTP requests are properly mocked to avoid real API calls  
  The tests use angular-mocks’ $httpBackend to intercept HTTP requests, ensuring no actual calls are made during testing.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that tests inject all required dependencies using AngularJS dependency injection  
  Dependencies such as REST, Page, Users, $location, $routeParams, and $translate are injected using AngularJS’s dependency injection mechanism via module and inject calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests properly handle promises and asynchronous operations  
  The tests use $q and $rootScope.$apply() to resolve promises (e.g., with $translate), confirming that asynchronous operations are correctly managed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of spies and mocks for external dependencies  
  Spies and mocks are extensively used for $broadcast, $location, localStorage, and REST methods. This ensures that external dependencies are isolated and controlled during tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests follow the describe/it pattern for clear organization  
  All tests are organized with the describe/it pattern, which clearly structures the tests into suites and individual test cases for better readability.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests cover both success and error scenarios for API calls  
  The tests cover both happy paths (e.g., a GET successfully returning data) and error branches (e.g., autocompleteTags error case) for API endpoints, ensuring robust testing.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests simulate user interactions where appropriate  
  User interactions, such as changing titles, URLs, and invoking controller methods related to saving or deleting pages, are simulated to mimic real scenarios.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests properly clean up after execution to prevent state leakage  
  Cleanup is performed by resetting states (e.g., the in-memory localStorage ‘store’ is cleared in beforeEach) and verifying that no outstanding HTTP requests remain, preventing residual state between tests.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested  
  The test names (e.g., 'should define blocks resource and GET a block by ID', 'should detect newerVersion when localStorage has unsaved edits', etc.) are descriptive and accurately indicate the intended behavior being tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests validate function outputs rather than implementation details when possible  
  The tests focus on verifying the expected outputs and side effects (for instance, checking the values of Page properties, localStorage updates, and calls to REST methods) rather than the internal implementation.
