# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Jest or another suitable testing framework is properly configured for React testing.  
  The answer provides configuration files for Jest (jest.config.js), Babel (babel.config.js), and Enzyme along with adapter setup, which confirms proper React testing configuration.

- **Pass** (100%): Tests use proper mocking techniques for API calls rather than making real network requests.  
  The answer includes manual mocks under __mocks__ for API calls (e.g., for api.js) and demonstrates the use of jest.mockResolvedValue/jest.mockRejectedValue to simulate network responses.

- **Pass** (100%): Form validation logic tests cover both synchronous and asynchronous validation scenarios.  
  The tests include separate suites for the synchronous validator (validate) and the asynchronous validator (asyncValidate), covering various error and success paths.

- **Pass** (100%): Test assertions properly check component rendering, state changes, and event handling.  
  The tests for the Signup component and the FormGroup component verify correct rendering (e.g., presence of DocumentTitle, h2 header, form elements) and check props/state changes (e.g., button disabled state, error message display).

- **Pass** (100%): Test doubles or mocks are used for Redux store interactions.  
  The answer demonstrates the use of a redux mock store (or jest.fn() for dispatch) and verifies that actions (such as auth.signupComplete) are called appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Tests properly handle asynchronous operations with appropriate wait/async patterns.  
  The tests employ async/await syntax along with expect(...).resolves and expect(...).rejects, ensuring asynchronous operations are correctly handled.

- **Pass** (100%): Form submission handling tests check both success and error paths.  
  The Signup component tests cover both a successful submission (dispatching signupComplete) and an error path (rejecting with error data).

- **Pass** (100%): Tests verify proper rendering of form elements and error messages under different conditions.  
  The tests for the FormGroup component check for correct rendering of children, proper styling (success/error), and accurate display of help-block text when errors are present.

- **Pass** (100%): Tests follow a consistent, readable structure with descriptive test names.  
  The test files use clear describe and it blocks with descriptive names and maintain a uniform structure across different test cases and files.

- **Pass** (95%): Tests achieve the specified 80% minimum code coverage across all files.  
  The answer mentions that running the tests will produce coverage reports showing over 80% coverage for key files like signup.js and form.js. Although the actual coverage result is not shown, the provided setup and instructions are designed to meet that target. (A slight uncertainty remains because the actual coverage report isnâ€™t provided, hence 95% confidence.)
