# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering  
  The file "src/app.test.tsx" includes tests that render the TodoApp component and verify the presence of header, main, and footer elements under different conditions.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos  
  The test "allows adding a new todo on ENTER key" confirms that a new todo is added when a value is entered and the ENTER key is pressed.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos  
  The test verifies the existence of the toggle-all checkbox and ensures that toggling it calls the model.toggleAll function with the appropriate boolean value.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos  
  The test "filters shown todos when route functions are invoked" examines the filtering of todos by invoking different routes and checking the number of list items rendered.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  There is a dedicated test ("shows footer with clear-completed and handles clearCompleted") that confirms the clear completed button is rendered and functions correctly when clicked.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering  
  The test "renders correct elements and classes" in "src/todoItem.test.tsx" ensures that the component renders the proper elements and class names.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos  
  The tests for onToggle (checkbox click), onDestroy (destroy button click), and onEdit (double-click on label) confirm these functionalities are correctly tested.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events  
  The tests checking for handling the ENTER and ESCAPE keys during edit mode ensure that keyboard events lead to the expected callbacks.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts  
  The tests in "src/footer.test.tsx" validate the rendering of the count (e.g., "2 items left") and the absence or presence of the clear button based on the provided counts.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation  
  The tests inspect the class names (e.g., "selected") of the filter links ("All", "Active", "Completed") to ensure proper navigation visuals.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  The test confirms that when the clear completed button is present and clicked, the callback function (onClearCompleted) is properly called.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos  
  In "src/todoModel.test.ts", tests for addTodo, toggleAll, toggle, destroy, and save functions are present and check the expected modifications to the model.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions  
  The test "notifies subscribers on inform()" confirms that subscribers are notified correctly and that localStorage is updated.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  There is a dedicated test ("clearCompleted() removes all completed todos") that verifies this functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation  
  The tests for Utils.uuid() check for string length, hyphen positions, uniqueness, and correct version/variant bits.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality  
  The tests for Utils.pluralize() validate that singular and plural forms are returned appropriately based on the count.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations  
  The tests for Utils.store() cover saving data, retrieving stored data, and returning an empty array when no data is saved.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function  
  The tests for Utils.extend() ensure that multiple objects are merged correctly without mutating the originals.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx  
  Most React component test files (app.test.tsx, footer.test.tsx, todoItem.test.tsx) follow the naming convention. However, non-React and utility tests use the ".test.ts" suffix, which is a common and accepted practice. This slight variation from the strict "[filename].test.tsx" naming is intentional and aligns with typical conventions in TypeScript projects.  
  Explanation: Though non-component tests are named "*.test.ts", it is conventional and acceptable, so this step passes with a minor note.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data  
  The tests consistently create sample todo objects and arrays (e.g., "const todo = { id: '1', title: 'Test me', ... }" and arrays of todos) across various files.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented  
  The test file "src/app.test.tsx" successfully mocks the global Router and verifies that the routing functions (e.g., routes for "/", "/active", "/completed") are set up and invoked correctly.
