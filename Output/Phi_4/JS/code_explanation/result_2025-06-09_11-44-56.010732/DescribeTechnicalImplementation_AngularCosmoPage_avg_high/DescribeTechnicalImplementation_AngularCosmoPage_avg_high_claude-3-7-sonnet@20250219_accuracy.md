# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the documentation correctly identifies Angular.js as the framework used
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all factories (REST, Page, Users) are accurately documented with their purposes
- **Pass** (100%): Check that the description of the Page controller and its functionality is technically accurate
- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the RESTful API endpoints are correctly documented
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the explanation of Angular module dependencies ($resource, $location, etc.) is correct
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the page management features (creating, editing, deleting) are accurately described
- **Fail** (80%): Confirm that the documentation accurately explains how the local storage mechanism works

    The documentation does not contain any specific information about local storage mechanisms. While it mentions storing data globally in factories (like Page Factory and Users Factory), it doesn't explicitly discuss local storage (localStorage or sessionStorage) implementations, how data persistence works between sessions, or any caching strategies that might be employed.

- **Fail** (100%): Check that the description of form validation logic is technically accurate

    The documentation does not include any information about form validation logic. There is no mention of Angular's form validation capabilities, custom validators, error handling, or how validation states are managed and displayed to users.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that the explanation of publish/schedule date handling is correct

    The documentation briefly mentions publish and schedule date functionality in the Page Factory interface specification (with fields like `published`, `published_date`) and in the sample code where `scheduleDate` is referenced. However, it doesn't provide detailed explanation of how the scheduling mechanism actually works.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the tag management and autocomplete feature explanation is technically accurate

    While tags are mentioned in the Page Factory interface and briefly in the sample code (`tags: Page.tags`), there is no explanation of tag management functionality or any autocomplete feature for tags. The documentation lacks details on how tags are created, suggested, or managed within the application.

- **Pass** (95%): Confirm that the relationship between controllers, factories, and templates is accurately explained

    The documentation explains how controllers interact with factories, particularly how the Page Controller uses the REST, Page, and Users factories. It mentions dependency injection and the overall architecture. However, it could provide more specific details on how templates are bound to these components.

- **Fail** (100%): Check that the documentation correctly identifies and explains the purpose of broadcast events

    The documentation does not mention any broadcast events or the event system in Angular.js. There is no explanation of $broadcast, $emit, or how components communicate through events in the application.
