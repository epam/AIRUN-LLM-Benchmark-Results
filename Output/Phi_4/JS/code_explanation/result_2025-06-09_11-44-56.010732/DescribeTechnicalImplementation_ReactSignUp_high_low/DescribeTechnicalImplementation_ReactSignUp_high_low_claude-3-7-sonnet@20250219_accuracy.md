- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that accessibility features are accurately documented with correct ARIA roles and attributes

    The documentation mentions "implicit ARIA roles" and describes some accessibility features, but doesn't provide specific ARIA role names or attributes that are implemented. While the general accessibility considerations seem accurate, more specific details about the exact ARIA roles and attributes would strengthen this section. The information provided is likely correct but somewhat general.
