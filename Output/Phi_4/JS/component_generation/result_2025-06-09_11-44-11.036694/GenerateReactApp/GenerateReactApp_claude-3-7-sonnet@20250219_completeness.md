# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The code makes an axios GET request to 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' in the CharacterList component and maps through the returned characters to display them in a list.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The code includes a loading state that's set to true initially and then set to false after the API call completes. While loading is true, the component returns a "Loading..." message.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The code maps through all characters in the response.data.results array and renders them as list items.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  The provided code doesn't contain any search functionality or user input fields, just a simple display of the characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character is rendered as a list item displaying the character.name property.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The instructions explicitly mention using Create React App with the TypeScript template:
  ```bash
  npx create-react-app swapi-characters --template typescript
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The CharacterList component uses three state variables to manage the application state:
  - characters: to store the character data
  - loading: to track when data is being fetched
  - error: to store any error messages if the fetch fails

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  Each list item has a key set to the index of the character in the array:
  ```jsx
  {characters.map((character, index) => (
    <li key={index}>{character.name}</li>
  ))}
  ```

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  The application handles loading states and error states explicitly, but doesn't have specific handling for an empty array of characters. However, if the API returns an empty array, the map function would simply not render any list items, which is an acceptable behavior. There's no explicit message for when characters array is empty but not due to an error.
