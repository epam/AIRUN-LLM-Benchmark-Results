# Evaluation Report

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The CharacterList component successfully fetches data from the SWAPI and maps over the results to display each character’s name in an unordered list.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  A loading indicator (“Loading…” text) is rendered when the loading state is true, showing the user that data is being fetched.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  The code maps over the fetched character array and renders each character name in a list item, ensuring that all characters returned by the API are displayed.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  There is no implementation of any search bar or user input field in the provided code, which is in line with the requirement.

- **Pass (100%)**: Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each list item clearly displays the character’s name as obtained from the API.

- **Pass (100%)**: Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The instructions include using Create React App with the TypeScript template, and the file structure follows the conventional pattern set up by Create React App.

- **Pass (100%)**: Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The component uses React’s useState for handling characters, loading, and error states and useEffect to manage the API call, which meets the requirement.

- **Fail (100%)**: Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  The list items use the index as the key (<li key={index}>). Although this works for small and static lists, it is not optimal for dynamic or re-orderable lists. Using a unique identifier such as the character’s URL (which is already available in the data) would be more appropriate for ensuring unique and stable keys.

- **Fail (100%)**: Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  There is no explicit handling for the case when the API returns an empty array. If there are no characters fetched (i.e., the characters array is empty), the UI will render an empty unordered list without any user feedback or message indicating that no data is available.
