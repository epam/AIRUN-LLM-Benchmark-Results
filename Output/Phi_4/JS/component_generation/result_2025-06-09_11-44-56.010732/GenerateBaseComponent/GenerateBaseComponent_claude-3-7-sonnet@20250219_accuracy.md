# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is implemented using React 18.x
  
  The code imports from React and uses React 18 compatible patterns, specifically the functional component approach with hooks like useState, useRef, and useEffect.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all component code is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
  
  The code uses TypeScript consistently, with properly defined interfaces (Option, SearchableSelectProps), type annotations for props, state variables, event handlers, and React.FC typing for the component.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component includes an index.css file for styling
  
  The CSS is included in the answer with appropriate styles for the searchable select component, and there's an import statement for it in the component: `import './index.css';`.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate the component has clean, production-ready code without any TODO comments
  
  The code is clean, well-organized, and contains no TODO comments or incomplete features.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that the component uses proper React state management for selected items and dropdown visibility
  
  The component properly uses useState hooks for managing state:
  - `isOpen` for dropdown visibility
  - `filteredOptions` for the filtered list
  - `selectedValue` for tracking selection
  - `inputValue` for the input field value

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is reusable by accepting customizable props
  
  The component accepts props through a well-defined interface (SearchableSelectProps) that includes:
  - `options` array for the dropdown items
  - `onChange` callback for selection changes

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component implements proper keyboard event handlers for navigation and selection
  
  The component implements comprehensive keyboard navigation:
  - Enter key for selection
  - Escape key to close dropdown
  - Arrow Up/Down for navigating options
  - All handled in the `handleKeyDown` function

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component follows React best practices for refs and DOM interactions
  
  The component uses useRef appropriately for referencing the select container, and implements proper event listeners with useEffect for detecting clicks outside the component.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the component implements proper focus management techniques
  
  The component handles focus appropriately with onFocus events and tabIndex attributes on list items. However, it could be improved by better focus handling when dropdown is closed or when navigating through keyboard.

- **Pass** (90%): Check that the component uses appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
  
  The component implements several ARIA attributes:
  - aria-expanded
  - aria-controls
  - aria-autocomplete
  - aria-activedescendant
  - aria-selected
  - role="option"
  
  However, it could benefit from additional attributes like aria-label for the input field.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is free of console errors and warnings
  
  The code appears clean without obvious errors or issues that would trigger console warnings, but complete validation would require actual runtime testing.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify there are no unnecessary re-renders in the component
  
  The component uses state efficiently and doesn't have obvious causes for unnecessary re-renders. However, memoization techniques like useCallback for event handlers or useMemo for filtered options are not implemented, which might be beneficial for larger option lists.
