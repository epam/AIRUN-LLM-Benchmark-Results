# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused
- **Fail** (90%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes

    The code doesn't explicitly manage focus when the dropdown closes. There's no implementation to ensure focus returns to the select component after dropdown closure. This would typically require setting focus explicitly using `ref.current.focus()` in handlers that close the dropdown.
