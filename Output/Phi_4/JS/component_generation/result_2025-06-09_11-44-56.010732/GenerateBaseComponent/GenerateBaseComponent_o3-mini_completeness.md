# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component renders a dropdown select UI element  
  The component conditionally renders a <ul> element with list items when the dropdown is open, which confirms that it renders a dropdown select UI.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the component includes a search input within the dropdown  
  The implementation includes an <input> element for search filtering. Although the input is outside of the dropdown list (<ul>), it is an integral part of the component for filtering—meeting the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component supports selecting a single item from the dropdown  
  The component maintains a state (selectedValue) and updates it when an option is selected via click or keyboard, ensuring that only one item is selected at a time.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys  
  The component handles 'ArrowDown' and 'ArrowUp' key events in the input’s onKeyDown handler to navigate through filtered options.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify items can be selected using the Enter key  
  The code handles the Enter key in two cases: when the dropdown is open (selecting the first option if applicable) and on each list item’s own keydown event (selecting that item), enabling selection using the Enter key.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown visibility can be toggled using the Enter key when the component is focused  
  In the onKeyDown handler, if the dropdown is closed and the Enter key is pressed, the component sets the dropdown to open. This directly satisfies the requirement.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify focus returns to the select component when the dropdown closes  
  The implementation does not explicitly return focus to the main select element (the input). After an option is selected—either by mouse click or keyboard—the focus is not programmatically set back to the input element, which may lead to inconsistent focus behavior for keyboard users.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when an item is selected via mouse click  
  The onClick handler on each list item calls handleSelectOption, which sets the dropdown visibility state (isOpen) to false, ensuring the dropdown closes.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown closes when an item is selected via keyboard  
  Since the onKeyDown event on list items triggers selection via Enter key—the same function (handleSelectOption) is called—the dropdown closes upon keyboard selection.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed  
  The onKeyDown handler of the input listens for the Escape key and appropriately sets isOpen to false.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component  
  A useEffect hook adds a global mouse down event listener to determine whether a click occurred outside of the component, and closes the dropdown if so.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the dropdown opens on Enter key press when the component is focused  
  If the dropdown is not already open, pressing Enter in the input’s onKeyDown will open the dropdown, thus fulfilling this requirement.
