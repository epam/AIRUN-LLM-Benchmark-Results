# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API
  
  The code fetches characters from the SWAPI API (`https://swapi.dev/api/people`) using Axios and displays the results in an unordered list.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls
  
  The application shows a "Loading..." message while the data is being fetched:
  ```typescript
  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI
  
  The code maps through all characters from the API response and renders each one:
  ```typescript
  return (
    <ul>
      {characters.map((character, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{character.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields
  
  The code doesn't implement any search functionality or input fields. It simply fetches and displays characters without any filtering mechanisms.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name
  
  Each character is displayed with its name property in a list item:
  ```typescript
  <li key={index}>{character.name}</li>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App
  
  The instructions clearly indicate using Create React App:
  ```bash
  npx create-react-app swapi-characters --template typescript
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states
  
  The application manages three states:
  ```typescript
  const [characters, setCharacters] = useState<Character[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);
  ```
  And it properly handles these states during the API call and rendering.

- **Pass** (80%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering
  
  The code uses array indices as keys:
  ```typescript
  characters.map((character, index) => (
    <li key={index}>{character.name}</li>
  ))
  ```
  While this provides a unique key, using array indices as keys is generally not recommended as it can lead to issues if the array order changes. A better key would be a unique identifier from the API data, such as a character ID or URL. However, the code does provide unique keys technically, so the requirement is met.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately
  
  If there are no characters in the response, the map function would return an empty array, which would render as an empty list. Additionally, error states are properly handled:
  ```typescript
  if (error) {
    return <div>{error}</div>;
  }
  ```
