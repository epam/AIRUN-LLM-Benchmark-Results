# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application displays a list of Star Wars characters from the API  
  The provided code fetches data from "https://swapi.dev/api/people" and maps over the results to display each character.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that a visual loading indicator is shown during API calls  
  The component renders a "Loading..." message while waiting for the API response.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all characters fetched from the API are displayed in the UI  
  The code iterates over the full list of characters returned from the API and displays their names in an unordered list.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application doesn't include any search functionality or user input fields  
  There is no search or input field; the application solely focuses on fetching and displaying the character list.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that each character entry in the list is properly displayed with the character name  
  Each character's name is shown within a list item (<li>), which meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application structure is created using Create React App  
  The setup instructions explicitly use Create React App with a TypeScript template.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has proper state management for loading, error, and character data states  
  The code uses React's useState hook to manage states for loading, error, and the fetched characters, and useEffect to trigger the fetch.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the character list items have unique keys for optimal rendering  
  Although the code provides keys for list items, it uses the array index as the key. For optimal rendering in React, a unique and stable identifier (such as a unique id or the character's URL) is recommended instead of the index.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty data states appropriately  
  There is no explicit handling for the scenario when the API returns an empty list (e.g., displaying a message like "No characters found"). The code will simply render an empty unordered list, which may not be ideal from a user experience perspective.
