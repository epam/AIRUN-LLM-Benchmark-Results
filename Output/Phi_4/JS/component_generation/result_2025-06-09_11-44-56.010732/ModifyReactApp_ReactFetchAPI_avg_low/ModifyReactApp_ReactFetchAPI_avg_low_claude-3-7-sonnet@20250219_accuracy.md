# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type
    
    The code correctly sets up the search input field that updates the `searchQuery` state via the `handleSearchChange` function when users type.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls
    
    The code uses `lodash.debounce` with a 300ms delay, which falls within the required 300-500ms range.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured
    
    Axios is imported and correctly used for making API requests to the Star Wars API.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses
    
    The code uses proper TypeScript typing throughout, including interface definition for Character, typing for state variables, and typing for event handlers.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters
    
    The API endpoint is correctly constructed with template literals to include the search query parameter: `https://swapi.dev/api/people/?search=${query}`

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate
    
    The code uses `useCallback` for the `fetchCharacters` function to prevent unnecessary re-creation of the function on each render.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback
    
    Error handling is implemented with try/catch blocks, setting an error state, and displaying error messages to the user.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing
    
    The debounced `fetchCharacters` function ensures API calls are only triggered after the user stops typing for 300ms.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices
    
    The code follows React best practices for state management using useState hooks for characters, loading, searchQuery, and error states.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code
    
    The code appears clean with no unused imports or commented-out code. There's a console.error for logging errors, but this is intentional for debugging purposes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests
    
    Loading state is properly managed by setting `loading` to true before API requests and false after they complete or fail.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns
    
    The component uses functional components with hooks, which aligns with React 18.x patterns and best practices.
