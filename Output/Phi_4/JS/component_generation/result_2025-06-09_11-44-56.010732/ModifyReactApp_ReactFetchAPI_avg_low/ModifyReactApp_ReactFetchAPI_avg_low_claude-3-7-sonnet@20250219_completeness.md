# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name
  
  The code includes an input field with `placeholder="Search characters..."` and `onChange={handleSearchChange}` that updates the `searchQuery` state, which is then used to filter characters by name through the API call.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests
  
  The code includes a loading indicator with `if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;` which displays during API requests as controlled by the `loading` state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query
  
  Initial data loading is implemented using a separate useEffect hook that calls `fetchCharacters('')` on component mount.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type
  
  The implementation uses a debounced search function that triggers API calls as users type, with the search query updating the state via `handleSearchChange`.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found
  
  The code includes a conditional rendering: `{characters.length > 0 ? (characters.map...) : (<li>No characters found</li>)}` which provides feedback when no results are found.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design
  
  The search input has responsive styling with `style={{ width: '100%', padding: '10px', marginBottom: '20px' }}` making it adaptable to different screen sizes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response
  
  The code maps over the `characters` state after API response to display each character name in a list item.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed
  
  While the code has error handling with try/catch blocks and displays error messages, it doesn't implement React Error Boundaries as components. The error handling is done at the API call level but not at the component tree level.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props
  
  The code defines a proper TypeScript interface for Character data (`interface Character`), and uses proper typing for state variables and component definition (`React.FC`).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities
  
  The implementation preserves the original functionality of displaying characters while adding search capabilities without removing any existing features.
