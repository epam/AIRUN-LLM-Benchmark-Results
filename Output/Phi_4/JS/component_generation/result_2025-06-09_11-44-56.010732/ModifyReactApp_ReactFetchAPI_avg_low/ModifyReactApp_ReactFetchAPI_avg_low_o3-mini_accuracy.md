# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the search input field properly updates state when users type  
  The input element uses the onChange handler (handleSearchChange) to update the searchQuery state, which is then reflected in the controlled input field.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm implementation of debouncing pattern with 300-500ms delay for search API calls  
  The code uses lodash.debounce with a 300ms delay on the fetchCharacters function, meeting the specified debounce requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that axios is used for API requests and properly configured  
  Axios is appropriately imported and used to make GET requests to the API endpoint with the search query included in the URL.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components, functions, and API responses  
  The code defines a Character interface and uses React.FC for the component. While the axios response is not explicitly typed, the usage of the Character interface for state is acceptable. (I am slightly less than 100% confident because applying explicit generics for the axios response could further enhance type safety.)

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the API endpoint is correctly constructed to include search parameters  
  The endpoint is constructed as "https://swapi.dev/api/people/?search=${query}", which correctly integrates the search parameter.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify implementation of useMemo and/or useCallback for performance optimization where appropriate  
  The fetchCharacters function is memoized using useCallback, which helps prevent unnecessary re-creations of the function on each render.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that error handling is implemented for API requests with appropriate user feedback  
  Errors are caught in a try/catch block, and an error message is set in the component state to provide user feedback upon failure.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that API calls are triggered only after the user stops typing  
  The debounced version of fetchCharacters ensures that API calls are delayed until the user has paused typing, preventing an API call on every keystroke.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that state management for search queries and results follows React best practices  
  The state for characters, searchQuery, error, and loading is managed using useState, and side effects are handled using useEffect, aligning with React best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that the code is free of console errors, unused imports, and commented-out code  
  All imported packages (React, axios, lodash.debounce) are used effectively, and there is no extraneous commented-out code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that loading state is properly managed during API requests  
  A loading state is set to true before the API call and reset to false after completion, with corresponding conditional rendering for a loading indicator.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the component is implemented following React 18.x patterns  
  The component uses modern React patterns including functional components, hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback), and proper separation of concerns, aligning with React 18.x best practices.
