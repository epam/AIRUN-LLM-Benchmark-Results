# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify presence of a search input field that filters characters by name  
  The code includes an input field with a placeholder "Search characters..." whose value is controlled by the component state. This input updates the search query used for filtering the characters.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application shows a loading indicator during API requests  
  The component conditionally renders a "Loading..." message when the loading state is true, ensuring that users see feedback during API calls.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure initial data loading occurs on component mount with an empty search query  
  There is a dedicated useEffect hook that calls fetchCharacters('') on mount, ensuring the initial data load occurs with an empty query.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that search results update dynamically as users type  
  The search input is linked to a debounced fetch function that responds to changes in the search query state, resulting in dynamic updates of the character list.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that visual feedback is provided when no results are found  
  When the fetched characters array is empty, the component renders a list item with "No characters found" as feedback to the user.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the search component is implemented with responsive design  
  The input field is styled using inline styles (width: 100% with padding and margin) which helps ensure a responsive design for various screen sizes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the character list displays search results after API response  
  After a successful API call, the component correctly maps the received characters to list items, displaying each character's name.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure appropriate error boundaries are implemented where needed  
  Although the code handles API errors by displaying an error message, it does not implement React Error Boundaries to catch rendering errors in the component tree. This might be acceptable for a simple example, but strictly speaking, the evaluation step requires proper error boundary implementation.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that all required TypeScript interfaces/types are defined for API data and component props  
  The code defines a TypeScript interface for Character and uses standard React.FC typings, ensuring that TypeScript types are properly set for both API data and component props.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains all original functionality while adding search capabilities  
  The original functionality—loading and displaying a list of characters—is preserved. The search functionality is added without interfering with the initial data load behavior or the overall component behavior.
