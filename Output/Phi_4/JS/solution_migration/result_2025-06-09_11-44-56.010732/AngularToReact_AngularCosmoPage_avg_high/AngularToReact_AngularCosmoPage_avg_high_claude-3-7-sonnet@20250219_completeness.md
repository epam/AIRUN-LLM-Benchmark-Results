# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented

    The provided code only shows basic create and update functionality through the `setPage` reducer in the `pageSlice.ts` file. There is no implementation of delete or duplicate functionality. While there's a placeholder `PageEditor` component that might handle updates, there's no evidence of comprehensive CRUD operations being fully implemented.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present

    The page state in `pageSlice.ts` includes a `type` field, which indicates that page type selection is part of the state management. However, I don't see specific UI components for selecting page types, just the state preparation for it.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists

    There is no code showing URL auto-generation based on the title. The code shows separate state management for title and URL, but no logic connecting them for auto-generation.

- **Pass** (80%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented

    The page state includes a `tags` array, indicating tag management is part of the data model. However, the code doesn't explicitly show autocomplete suggestion implementation, only that the tags field exists.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available

    The page state includes a `publish` field, and there's a `scheduleDate` field, suggesting that different publish statuses including scheduling are supported in the data model.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented

    The page state includes a `scheduleDate` field of type `Date | null`, clearly indicating support for scheduled publishing.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present

    While there is a custom hook for local storage (`useLocalStorage`), there is no implementation of version comparison or restoration functionality in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented

    There is no notification system implementation visible in the provided code. No toast/alert components or notification state management is shown.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present

    The code doesn't include form validation logic for required fields. There's basic form handling but no validation implementation.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled

    The code only shows a single API endpoint for fetching a page. There's no comprehensive API service implementation covering all endpoints from the original Angular application.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented

    There is no implementation of extras management functionality in the provided code.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained

    There is no implementation of revision history functionality in the provided code.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components

    The code structure example clearly shows organization into feature folders with separation of business logic (slices) from UI components.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved

    The code includes i18next setup for internationalization, showing a basic translation example. However, it's unclear if all translations from the original application are covered.

- **Fail** (80%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters

    While there is a basic routing setup, there isn't enough detail to confirm that the same URL structure and parameters from the Angular application are maintained.
