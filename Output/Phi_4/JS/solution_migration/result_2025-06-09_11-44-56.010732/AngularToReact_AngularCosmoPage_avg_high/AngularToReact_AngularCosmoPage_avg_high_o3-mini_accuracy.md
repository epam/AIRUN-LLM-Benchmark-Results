# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all components are implemented using TypeScript with strict typing for variables, functions, and props  
  All provided examples (such as PageEditor, PageForm, and Redux slices) are written in TypeScript and leverage interfaces or typing (e.g., PageState, React.FC).  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for global state management  
  The answer demonstrates Redux Toolkit usage with createSlice (see the pageSlice example) and appropriate store configuration.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React functional components are used instead of class components  
  All components (PageEditor, PageForm, NewPage, and App) are implemented as React functional components.  

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) are used appropriately  
  The answer uses useState and useEffect appropriately in the examples. However, although useCallback and useMemo are mentioned in the evaluation step, they are not shown in the code snippets. This does not constitute an error since their usage depends on context, but the omission causes a slight reduction in confidence.  

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that API communication is implemented using fetch or axios instead of $resource  
  The API service example clearly uses axios for making HTTP requests.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that form handling uses React controlled components  
  The PageForm component is implemented using controlled components with state management via useState and event handlers.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that React Router is implemented for navigation  
  The App component code sets up routing using react-router-dom with BrowserRouter, Route, and Switch.  

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that an appropriate React i18n library is used for internationalization  
  The i18n setup is correctly implemented using i18next along with initReactI18next.  

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that code splitting is implemented for performance optimization  
  Although the answer mentions code splitting and presents a snippet using React.memo, it does not demonstrate code splitting (e.g., using React.lazy and Suspense) explicitly.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that React.memo is used for expensive render operations  
  An example is provided where React.memo is applied to the PageEditor component to optimize performance.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that proper dependency arrays are used in useEffect and other hooks  
  The useEffect hooks demonstrate the appropriate use of dependency arrays (e.g., in the local storage hook and PageEditor), ensuring side effects run correctly.  

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data models  
  Interfaces (such as PageState) are defined for key data models, ensuring clarity and type safety.  

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that Redux selectors are used for accessing state  
  The useSelector hook is employed in the PageEditor component to access state from the Redux store.  

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that proper action creators are implemented for state mutations  
  The setPage action creator is properly generated in the Redux slice for handling state mutations.  

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that local storage functionality is implemented using appropriate hooks  
  A custom hook (useLocalStorage) is provided to handle local storage access using useState and useEffect.
