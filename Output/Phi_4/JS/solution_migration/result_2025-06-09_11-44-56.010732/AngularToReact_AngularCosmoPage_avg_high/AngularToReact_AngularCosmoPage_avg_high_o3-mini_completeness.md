# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that all page management functionality (create, update, delete, duplicate) is implemented  
  The answer does not demonstrate implementations for creating, deleting, duplicating, or updating pages. It only provides a high-level guide and basic state management without covering all aspects of page management.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that page type selection functionality is present  
  Although the state includes a "type" property, there is no implementation showing how users choose or change the page type in the UI.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that URL auto-generation from title functionality exists  
  There is no code demonstrating how the URL is automatically generated based on the title input.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that tag management with autocomplete suggestions is implemented  
  The guide includes a tags array in the page state but does not provide any components or logic to handle tag input with autocomplete suggestions.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that publish status options (publish, draft, schedule) are available  
  While the state contains a generic "publish" field, the answer does not implement or describe the UI or logic to select between different publish statuses (e.g., publish, draft, schedule).

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that scheduled publishing date functionality is implemented  
  The code has a "scheduleDate" field in the state, but there is no component or mechanism provided to handle scheduling or updating the scheduled publishing date.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that local storage version comparison and restoration features are present  
  The custom hook for local storage handles basic saving and retrieving but does not include features for version comparison or restoration of previous versions.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that notification system for success/error messages is implemented  
  There is no implementation of any notification system to alert users about success or error messages.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that form validation for required fields (URL, page type) is present  
  The provided form examples lack validation logic for required fields such as the URL and page type.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that all API endpoints from the original code are properly handled  
  The answer only shows a single API method (fetchPage), without addressing the full set of API endpoints that might have existed in the original Angular application.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that extras management functionality is implemented  
  There is no mention or implementation of extras management functionality in the guide.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate that revision history functionality is maintained  
  The answer does not provide any components or logic to handle revision history management.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that the code is organized into feature folders with separation of business logic from UI components  
  The code structure clearly separates features (e.g., pageSlice, PageEditor, PageForm) and organizes code into dedicated folders, maintaining a clean separation between business logic and UI components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that all translation functionality is preserved  
  The guide includes a setup for i18next with translation resources and configuration, indicating that translation functionality is preserved.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same URL structure and parameters  
  The routing is set up to handle dynamic URLs (using "/:url") and a dedicated route for new pages ("/new"), which suggests that the applicationâ€™s URL structure and parameters are maintained.
