# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling
  
  The signup component clearly uses Angular's Reactive Forms approach. This is evident from the import of `FormBuilder`, `FormGroup`, and `Validators` from `@angular/forms`, and the initialization of the form using `this.fb.group()` in the constructor.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)
  
  The form correctly implements all required synchronous validations:
  ```typescript
  this.signupForm = this.fb.group({
    name: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3), Validators.maxLength(60)]],
    email: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.email]],
    password: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.minLength(6)]],
  });
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use
  
  The component implements asynchronous validation through the `asyncValidators` function which calls the API service to check if name and email are already taken:
  ```typescript
  asyncValidators = (formGroup: FormGroup) => {
    const name = formGroup.get('name');
    const email = formGroup.get('email');

    if (name.value) {
      this.api.isName(name.value).subscribe(result => {
        if (result.data) {
          name.setErrors({ nameTaken: true });
        }
      });
    }

    if (email.value) {
      this.api.isEmail(email.value).subscribe(result => {
        if (result.data) {
          email.setErrors({ emailTaken: true });
        }
      });
    }
  };
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched
  
  The template uses the `ngClass` directive to apply appropriate styling based on validation state:
  ```html
  <input
    type="text"
    class="form-control"
    placeholder="Name"
    formControlName="name"
    [ngClass]="{ 'is-invalid': name.touched && name.invalid }"
  />
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions
  
  The `onSubmit()` method correctly dispatches the signup action to the store with the form values:
  ```typescript
  onSubmit() {
    if (this.signupForm.valid) {
      this.store.dispatch(
        AuthActions.signup({
          name: this.signupForm.value.name,
          email: this.signupForm.value.email,
          password: this.signupForm.value.password,
        })
      );
    }
  }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails
  
  The template includes error messages that are displayed conditionally based on specific validation errors:
  ```html
  <div *ngIf="name.touched && name.errors" class="invalid-feedback">
    <div *ngIf="name.errors.required">Name is required.</div>
    <div *ngIf="name.errors.minlength">Name must be at least 3 characters.</div>
    <div *ngIf="name.errors.maxlength">Name must be at most 60 characters.</div>
    <div *ngIf="name.errors.nameTaken">This name is already in use.</div>
  </div>
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service
  
  The title service is properly injected and used in the constructor:
  ```typescript
  constructor(
    private fb: FormBuilder,
    private store: Store,
    private api: ApiService,
    private router: Router,
    private titleService: Title
  ) {
    this.titleService.setTitle('Signup');
    // ...
  }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management
  
  The implementation correctly sets up NgRx store and effects:
  1. Store is properly imported and injected into the component
  2. Actions are defined in auth.actions.ts
  3. Reducer is created in auth.reducer.ts
  4. Effects are implemented in auth.effects.ts
  5. All are correctly wired up in the AppModule

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress
  
  The submit button is only disabled based on form validity, not on submission status:
  ```html
  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary" [disabled]="signupForm.invalid">
    Signup
  </button>
  ```
  There is no logic to disable the button during the actual submission process. The implementation should include a loading state in the store and use it to disable the button while the request is in progress.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses
  
  The effects implementation correctly handles success by mapping to a signupComplete action:
  ```typescript
  map(data => AuthActions.signupComplete({ data })),
  catchError(error => of({ type: '[Auth] Signup Failed', error }))
  ```
  However, the error case doesn't use a properly created action (it's using an object literal instead of a created action), which is a minor issue but doesn't prevent the functionality from working.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management
  
  The component follows Angular best practices with proper constructor injection, getter methods for form controls, and clear separation of concerns between template and component logic.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises
  
  The implementation correctly uses Angular's HttpClient for API calls through the ApiService:
  ```typescript
  signup(name: string, email: string, password: string): Observable<any> {
    return this.http.post('/api/signup', { name, email, password });
  }
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements
  
  The error messages in the template match the required messaging:
  - "Name is required."
  - "Name must be at least 3 characters."
  - "Name must be at most 60 characters."
  - "This name is already in use."
  - "Email is required."
  - "Invalid email format."
  - "This email is already in use."
  - "Password is required."
  - "Password must be at least 6 characters."
