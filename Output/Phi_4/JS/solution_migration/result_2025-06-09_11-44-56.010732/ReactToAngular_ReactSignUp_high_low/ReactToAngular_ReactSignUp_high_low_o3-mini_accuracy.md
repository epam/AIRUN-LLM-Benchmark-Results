# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses Angular's Reactive Forms for form handling  
  The component is constructed using FormBuilder and FormGroup, and the module imports ReactiveFormsModule.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm form validation includes synchronous validation for name length (3-60 characters), email format, and password length (minimum 6 characters)  
  Validators in the component ensure name is required with a minimum length of 3 and a maximum of 60, email is required and in correct format, and password is required with a minimum length of 6.

- **Pass** (85%): Verify asynchronous validation checks if name and email are already in use  
  The implementation calls the API (isName and isEmail) within a method meant for asynchronous validation and sets errors when needed. However, instead of using Angular’s built‑in async validator mechanism (which typically returns a Promise or Observable and is provided as the third argument to FormBuilder.group), the code invokes subscriptions directly inside a synchronous validator. This unconventional approach works for checking, but it may lead to potential issues like unhandled subscription lifecycles. This leads to a slightly reduced confidence level.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure form fields show appropriate validation feedback (success/error styling) when touched  
  The template conditionally applies an “is-invalid” class and renders error messages when form controls are touched and invalid.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the signup form submission correctly calls the API service and dispatches appropriate actions  
  On valid submission, the component dispatches the AuthActions.signup action with the collected form data. Although it doesn’t call the API service directly (delegating API interaction to effects), it meets the requirement by triggering the correct state management flow.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify error messages are displayed below form fields when validation fails  
  Error messages for required validation, minlength, maxlength, invalid email, and custom errors (nameTaken and emailTaken) are properly set up in the template.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page title is set correctly using Angular's Title service  
  The component sets the title to “Signup” using titleService.setTitle() in the constructor.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component uses @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects for state management  
  The implementation dispatches actions to the store and registers effects for handling the signup API call.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the form disables the submit button while submission is in progress  
  The submit button is only disabled based on form validity (signupForm.invalid). There is no mechanism (such as a loading flag or similar) to disable the button during the actual submission process, so if the API call is in progress, the form can potentially be re-submitted.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API call properly handles both success and error responses  
  In AuthEffects, the API call is handled by mapping success responses to a signupComplete action and errors to a failure action, fulfilling the requirement.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the component follows Angular best practices for component structure and lifecycle management  
  The component is well-structured and leverages Angular features appropriately. However, the use of subscriptions within the synchronous validator (asyncValidators) without unsubscribing may lead to potential memory leaks in a long-running application. This non-standard practice slightly reduces confidence.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of Angular's HttpClient for API calls instead of direct promises  
  The ApiService correctly injects and uses Angular’s HttpClient for all HTTP operations.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the form validation displays the same error messages as specified in the requirements  
  The error messages for invalid inputs (e.g., required, minlength, maxlength, invalid email, email/name already in use) match the specifications provided for the requirements.
