# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup component includes all three required form fields: name, email, and password  
  The SignupComponent defines a FormGroup with controls for "name", "email", and "password", and the template binds each input to its respective control.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page includes a heading 'Join PodBaby today.'  
  The template starts with an <h2> element that exactly reads "Join PodBaby today.".

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a lead paragraph about membership benefits  
  A paragraph with the class "lead" is present, which provides details about the benefits of membership.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the form includes a submit button with appropriate styling and icon  
  Although a submit button exists with the class "btn btn-primary" (providing styling), there is no evidence of an icon being implemented alongside the button. The requirement specifically calls out the inclusion of an icon.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the page includes a link to the login page with appropriate text  
  The template includes an <a> element with routerLink="/login" and the text "Already a member? Log in here.", which meets the requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the FormGroup component or equivalent is implemented to handle form field styling and error display  
  The use of Angular Reactive Forms combined with conditional CSS classes (via [ngClass]) and error messages (using *ngIf) confirms this functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the Icon component or equivalent is implemented for the signup button  
  There is no Icon component or any equivalent code that integrates an icon with the signup button. Only the button with text "Signup" is provided.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm all validation rules are implemented (name length, email format, password length)  
  The validators for name (required, minLength of 3, maxLength of 60), email (required, valid email format) and password (required, minLength of 6) are all implemented correctly.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure asynchronous validation for both name and email uniqueness is implemented  
  The component uses an asyncValidator function (attached to the FormGroup) that subscribes to API calls for name and email uniqueness. Although the implementation uses subscriptions inside the validator function rather than returning an observable that maps to errors (a more conventional approach), the basic asynchronous check is implemented.  
  Explanation: The pattern is somewhat unconventional; typically, asynchronous validators return an observable with validation results.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the signup API integration is complete with proper error handling  
  The NgRx Effect for signup properly dispatches a success action on success and handles errors using catchError, dispatching a "[Auth] Signup Failed" action.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the form layout matches the horizontal form structure specified  
  The provided template appears to be vertically structured rather than the horizontal form layout that was specified. There is no usage of a grid system or horizontal arrangement for labels and input fields.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the page has proper document title setting functionality  
  The SignupComponent injects Angular's Title service and correctly sets the document title to "Signup" during component initialization.
