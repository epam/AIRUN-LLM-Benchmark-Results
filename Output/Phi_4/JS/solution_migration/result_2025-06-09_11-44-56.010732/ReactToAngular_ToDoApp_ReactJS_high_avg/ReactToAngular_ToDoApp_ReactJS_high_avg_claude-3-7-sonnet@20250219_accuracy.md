# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)
- **Fail** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators

  The code doesn't show any implementation of @ViewChild decorators to replace React refs. This would be particularly important for direct DOM manipulation or accessing child component methods, which was likely handled with refs in the React version.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented
- **Fail** (90%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate

  While the answer mentions optimizing change detection with OnPush strategy in the "Optimize and Finalize" section, there's no actual implementation shown in any of the component code examples. Components should include `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` where appropriate.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation
- **Pass** (80%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions

  The code generally follows Angular conventions, but without seeing all components and the complete application structure, I can't be 100% certain all style guide recommendations are followed.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings
- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs

  The answer explicitly mentions "Remove any TODOs" in the optimization section, which suggests TODOs still exist in the code and need to be removed.

- **Fail** (80%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules

  While lazy loading is mentioned in the "Optimize and Finalize" section, there's no actual implementation shown. The routing module doesn't include any lazy loading configuration.
