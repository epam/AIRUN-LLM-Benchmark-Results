# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items
  
  The answer includes a comprehensive implementation of displaying todo items through the `TodoListComponent`, with state management through NgRx selectors (`selectAllTodos`) and proper rendering in Angular templates.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented
  
  The implementation includes an `addTodo` action and corresponding reducer logic that properly handles adding new todos with unique IDs.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works
  
  The answer includes both the `toggleTodo` action and the corresponding reducer implementation that toggles a todo's completed status, along with component code that emits toggle events.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented
  
  The answer includes editing functionality through the `saveTodo` action and corresponding reducer, along with the `TodoItemComponent` implementation that handles edit mode, text changes, and submission.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented
  
  The answer implements todo deletion through the `destroyTodo` action and corresponding reducer, with proper filtering logic to remove the specified todo from the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented
  
  The answer includes the `toggleAll` action and corresponding reducer that sets all todos to the specified completed state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works
  
  The answer implements routing for different filter states ('all', 'active', 'completed') and includes the necessary state management with the `nowShowing` property in the state.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items
  
  While the answer mentions creating a todo-footer component, it doesn't explicitly show the implementation for counting and displaying active items. However, the state management structure would support this functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items
  
  The answer includes the `clearCompleted` action and corresponding reducer that filters out completed todos from the state.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage
  
  The answer implements local storage persistence through the `TodoService` which uses the `Utils.store` method to save todos to local storage after every state change.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation
  
  The routing configuration in the answer maintains the expected URL structure with routes for '/all', '/active', and '/completed'.

- **Fail** (70%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states
  
  The answer doesn't explicitly mention or implement handling for empty states (when no todos exist). This is an important UX consideration that appears to be missing from the implementation.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly
  
  The answer shows handling of form submissions for editing todos, including blur events, key events (Enter/Escape), and proper validation of empty inputs. However, it doesn't explicitly show the implementation for the main todo input form.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships
  
  The answer outlines a clear component hierarchy with parent-child relationships handled through Angular's @Input() and @Output() decorators, properly separating concerns between components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved
  
  The answer comprehensively migrates all the core business logic from React to Angular, including state management, component lifecycle handling, and event management.
