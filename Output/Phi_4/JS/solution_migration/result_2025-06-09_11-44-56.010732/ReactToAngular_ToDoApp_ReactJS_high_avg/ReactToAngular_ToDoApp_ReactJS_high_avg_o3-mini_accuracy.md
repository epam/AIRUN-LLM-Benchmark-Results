# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
  The provided answer does not specify that Angular 14.x is being used (e.g., via package.json or explicit version notes). It simply uses standard Angular CLI commands, making it unclear whether Angular 14.x is targeted.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that @ngrx/store is used for state management  
  The answer includes installation instructions for @ngrx/store and proper usage within the reducer and selector files.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for handling side effects  
  The provided code clearly implements effects using createEffect from @ngrx/effects and demonstrates side-effect handling in the TodoEffects class.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper actions, reducers, and selectors are implemented in the NgRx store  
  The answer includes well-defined actions, reducers, and selectors aligning with NgRx best practices.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that components use appropriate Angular decorators (@Component, @Input, @Output)  
  The TodoItemComponent correctly uses the @Component decorator along with @Input and @Output for binding and event emission.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that React refs are replaced with Angular @ViewChild decorators  
  There is no evidence in the answer that React refs have been replaced with Angular’s @ViewChild. No @ViewChild decorator is present in the converted Angular components.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that component communication uses @Input() for property binding and @Output() EventEmitter for event handling  
  The communication pattern in TodoItemComponent, using @Input() and @Output() with EventEmitter, is correctly implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are used for data handling and business logic  
  The TodoService in the answer handles data operations and business logic appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented  
  Dependency injection is properly demonstrated in the effects and services (e.g., injecting Actions and TodoService).

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that Angular change detection strategies are applied where appropriate  
  Although there is a mention in Step 6 to “optimize change detection,” the actual implementation of change detection strategies (such as using OnPush) is not shown in the code.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular Router is used for navigation  
  The answer includes a correctly configured AppRoutingModule with routes defined for navigation.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application follows Angular style guide conventions  
  The structure and code styles generally adhere to Angular conventions. However, without a deeper style inspection or linting evidence, there is slight uncertainty (thus 90%).

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that TypeScript interfaces and types are properly maintained throughout the application  
  Interfaces such as ITodo and State are used appropriately, indicating proper TypeScript type usage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that JSX templates are converted to Angular HTML templates  
  The React JSX is successfully replaced with Angular HTML templates as seen in the TodoItemComponent’s template.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that React event handlers are replaced with Angular event bindings  
  The migration replaces React event handlers with Angular event bindings (e.g., using (change) and (keydown)).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs  
  There are no leftover TODO comments in the provided answer.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that lazy loading is implemented for feature modules  
  Although lazy loading is mentioned as a recommendation in the final step, the answer does not include an actual implementation of lazy loading for feature modules.
