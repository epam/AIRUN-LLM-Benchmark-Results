# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (90%): Verify that the todo list application displays all todo items  
  The migration guide instructs the creation of a todo-list component and NgRx selectors (e.g. selectAllTodos) but it does not show the explicit implementation of a view (e.g. using *ngFor in the todo-list component) that guarantees all todos will be displayed. This omission creates uncertainty about the completeness of displaying all items.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that adding new todo items functionality is implemented  
  The guide provides an "addTodo" action in the NgRx actions file and a corresponding "addTodo" method in the TodoService. Although the UI details for entering a new todo are not fully shown, the underlying functionality for adding todos is present.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that toggling todo items as complete/incomplete works  
  The guide includes a "toggleTodo" action, an associated reducer in the todoReducer, and a checkbox implementation in the TodoItemComponent, ensuring that toggling functionality is handled.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that editing todo items functionality is implemented  
  Code in the TodoItemComponent demonstrates editing behavior with event handlers for initiating, submitting, and canceling an edit, which covers the editing functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that deleting todo items functionality is implemented  
  The migration includes a "destroyTodo" action, corresponding reducer logic, and a UI trigger (destroy button in the TodoItemComponent), which confirms that deletion of todos is implemented.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the 'Mark all as complete' functionality is implemented  
  The guide provides a "toggleAll" action and the reducer logic to update the completion state of all todos. Although the UI element (e.g. a “Mark all as complete” checkbox or button) is not explicitly shown, the underlying functionality is prepared.

- **Fail** (85%): Confirm that filtering todos by 'all', 'active', and 'completed' works  
  While the AppRoutingModule is configured with routes for 'all', 'active', and 'completed', there is no explicit filtering logic provided (e.g., using different selectors or filtering conditions in the reducer) to differentiate between active and completed todos. This raises questions about the practical filtering of items.

- **Fail** (80%): Ensure that the footer displays the count of active items  
  The migration instructs generating a "todo-footer" component, but no code snippet or explanation is provided to show how the active item count is calculated or displayed, leaving this aspect unverified.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the 'Clear completed' button removes completed items  
  The guide contains a "clearCompleted" action and proper reducer logic that filters out completed todos. This ensures that clicking the clear completed button would remove the completed items.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that todo items are persisted to local storage  
  The TodoService persists todos using a utility function (Utils.store) both when reading and writing the todos, indicating that local storage persistence is implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains the same URL structure for navigation  
  The AppRoutingModule clearly defines routes for '', 'all', 'active', and 'completed' so that the URL structure corresponds to the expected navigation patterns.

- **Fail** (80%): Confirm that the application displays appropriate UI for empty states  
  There is no explicit handling or UI code provided in the guide for the case when no todos exist (empty state). Without such instructions or code, it is unclear whether the UI covers this scenario appropriately.

- **Pass** (85%): Ensure that the application handles form submissions correctly  
  The TodoItemComponent includes methods (handleSubmit, handleChange, handleKeyDown) to manage form submission for editing, which demonstrates correct handling. However, the code for the form used to add new todos is not detailed, so this evaluation is based on partial coverage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application maintains proper component relationships  
  The guide outlines generating separate components (todo-list, todo-item, todo-footer) and communicates via Angular’s @Input() and @Output(), indicating a structured and proper component relationship.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure that all business logic from the original application is preserved  
  By migrating state management to NgRx (with actions, reducers, effects) and implementing corresponding service methods, the migration guide preserves the original business logic such as adding, editing, deleting, toggling, and clearing todos.
