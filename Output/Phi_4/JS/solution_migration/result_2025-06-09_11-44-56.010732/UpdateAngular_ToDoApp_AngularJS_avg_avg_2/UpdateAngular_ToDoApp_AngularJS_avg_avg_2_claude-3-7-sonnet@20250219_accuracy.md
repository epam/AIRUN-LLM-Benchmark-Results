# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework
  
  The answer explicitly mentions migrating to Angular 14.x and includes Angular CLI commands to create a new Angular project.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS
  
  The answer specifically mentions "Remove RequireJS: Angular CLI uses ES modules, so you can remove RequireJS dependencies."

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management
  
  The answer includes installation commands (`ng add @ngrx/store`) and implementation examples of store with actions and reducers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects
  
  The answer includes installation commands (`ng add @ngrx/effects`) and provides a code example for implementing effects.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management
  
  The answer shows examples of actions (`addTodo`, `toggleTodo`), reducers (with state management for todos), and effects (with the `loadTodos$` effect).

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator
  
  The answer demonstrates proper use of the `@Injectable` decorator in the `TodoStorageService` example.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service
  
  The `TodoStorageService` example shows implementation of localStorage for todo persistence with `getTodos()` and `saveTodos()` methods.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators
  
  While the answer doesn't show the complete component implementation with decorators, it shows commands to generate components using Angular CLI which would include proper decorators.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators
  
  The answer includes an example of a custom directive (`TodoFocusDirective`) with the proper `@Directive` decorator.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)
  
  The answer specifically mentions using `*ngFor` for loops and `*ngIf` for conditional rendering in the "Update HTML Templates" section.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))
  
  The answer mentions component communication using `@Input()` and `@Output()` which implies event binding, though specific `(click)` examples aren't shown.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])
  
  The answer mentions using `[(ngModel)]` for two-way binding, which is a form of property and event binding, but doesn't specifically show `[class.completed]` or similar examples.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed
  
  While not explicitly showing lifecycle hook implementations, the answer mentions "Angular's built-in features" in the optimization section which would include lifecycle hooks.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models
  
  The answer includes a `TodoState` interface in the reducer example, but doesn't have extensive examples of data models.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services
  
  The answer shows dependency injection in the Effects class constructor and mentions the service is injectable, but doesn't show extensive examples in components.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions
  
  The answer specifically mentions "Follow Angular Style Guide" and suggests using tools like TSLint or ESLint with Angular-specific rules.

- **Fail** (90%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings
  
  The answer doesn't address debugging or ensuring the application runs without console errors or warnings. It mentions testing but not specifically error-free operation.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)
  
  The answer explicitly mentions "Use interfaces, types, and enums where appropriate" and demonstrates interfaces in the code examples.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code
  
  The answer includes a commented line "// Handle other actions" in the reducer and "// Add more actions as needed" which are effectively TODOs.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design
  
  The answer implies a proper component structure with separate components for todo-list and todo-item, and a separate service for storage, but doesn't explicitly discuss single responsibility principle.
