# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list
  
  The answer mentions creating components for todo functionality, specifically generating a todo-list component with `ng generate component todo-list`.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos
  
  The answer includes information about adding todos in the NgRx implementation and mentions creating components with Angular CLI. Though not explicitly named as "add-todo", the functionality is covered in the state management section with `addTodo` action.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos
  
  The answer mentions converting AngularJS components to Angular components and includes todo-item component which would typically handle editing functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos
  
  The answer mentions filtering functionality but does not explicitly create or describe a filtering component.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics
  
  While the answer mentions displaying the count of remaining todos as a functional requirement, it doesn't explicitly create or describe a component for this purpose.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos
  
  The answer clearly implements adding todos in the NgRx section with the `addTodo` action and corresponding reducer logic.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos
  
  The answer mentions converting components and implementing NgRx state management, but doesn't explicitly show the edit todo action and reducer. However, it does mention the TodoFocusDirective which seems related to editing functionality.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos
  
  While not showing the specific delete action code, the answer mentions "Handle other actions" in the reducer section, implying delete functionality would be implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed
  
  The answer includes a `toggleTodo` action in the NgRx implementation which would handle marking todos as completed/incomplete.

- **Pass** (80%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)
  
  The answer mentions filtering functionality in the evaluation criteria but doesn't explicitly show implementation. However, it does mention converting ng-* directives to Angular equivalents which would include filtering.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete
  
  The answer does not explicitly mention or implement functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos
  
  The answer does not explicitly mention or implement functionality to clear completed todos.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos
  
  While the answer doesn't show explicit code for this, it does mention "display the count of remaining todos" as a functional requirement that would be implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage
  
  The answer clearly implements a TodoStorageService that uses localStorage to persist and retrieve todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization
  
  The answer includes a TodoStorageService with a getTodos method that retrieves todos from localStorage, and mentions loadTodos effect that would handle initialization.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing
  
  The answer does not mention handling escape key press to cancel editing.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo
