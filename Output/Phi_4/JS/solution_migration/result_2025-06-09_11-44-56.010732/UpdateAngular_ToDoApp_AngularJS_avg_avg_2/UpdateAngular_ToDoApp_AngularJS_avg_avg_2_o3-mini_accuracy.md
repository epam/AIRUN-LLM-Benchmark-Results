# Evaluation Report

1. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application uses Angular 14.x framework  
   The answer clearly states “Migrating an AngularJS application to Angular 14.x” and demonstrates steps appropriate for Angular 14.x, which confirms the usage of that framework.

2. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application uses ES modules instead of RequireJS  
   The guide instructs to “Remove RequireJS” and references Angular CLI’s default use of ES modules.

3. **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/store is implemented for state management  
   The answer includes installation (`ng add @ngrx/store`) and sample code for actions and reducers, confirming the implementation of @ngrx/store.

4. **Pass** (100%): Verify that @ngrx/effects is implemented for side effects  
   The guide shows installation (`ng add @ngrx/effects`) and provides a sample effect using createEffect, demonstrating proper usage.

5. **Fail** (100%): Confirm that appropriate actions, reducers, selectors, and effects are defined for todo management  
   Although actions, reducers, and effects for todo management are provided, there is no explicit definition or example of selectors. Since selectors are part of the evaluation criteria, this point is marked as a failure.

6. **Pass** (100%): Verify that Angular services are properly injectable with @Injectable decorator  
   The service examples use the @Injectable decorator (e.g., TodoStorageService and TodoEffects), confirming correct implementation.

7. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that localStorage is used for data persistence in a service  
   The provided TodoStorageService code clearly uses localStorage for persistence.

8. **Pass** (90%): Verify that Angular components use proper @Component decorators  
   The instructions recommend using Angular CLI to create components (which automatically includes @Component decorators). However, an explicit code snippet for a component is not provided. This indirect evidence makes us slightly less than 100% confident, but overall it is considered acceptable.

9. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that Angular directives use proper @Directive decorators  
   The answer includes a complete example of an Angular directive with an @Directive decorator.

10. **Pass** (100%): Verify that component templates use Angular template syntax (e.g., *ngFor, *ngIf)  
    The guide mentions converting HTML templates to use Angular’s *ngFor and *ngIf syntax.

11. **Fail** (90%): Confirm that event binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., (click))  
    No explicit code sample or instruction regarding event binding (such as a (click) event) is provided. While the guide alludes to component communication using @Input and @Output, an explicit demonstration of event binding is missing. This results in a slight lack of confidence.

12. **Fail** (90%): Verify that property binding uses proper Angular syntax (e.g., [class.completed])  
    There is no example demonstrating property binding such as [class.completed]. This omission causes us to mark the step as a failure with slightly reduced confidence.

13. **Fail** (90%): Confirm that Angular lifecycle hooks are properly implemented where needed  
    The answer does not provide any examples of lifecycle hook usage (e.g., ngOnInit, ngOnDestroy). The absence of a lifecycle hook demonstration leads to a failure on this step, with a small uncertainty since the guide is high-level.

14. **Pass** (100%): Verify that TypeScript interfaces or classes are used for data models  
    The reducer code declares an interface (TodoState), confirming the use of TypeScript interfaces.

15. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that dependency injection is properly implemented in components and services  
    The code snippets (e.g., in TodoEffects and TodoStorageService) show dependency injection in action, which meets the requirement.

16. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code follows Angular style guide conventions  
    The answer recommends following Angular’s style guide and best practices. Although sample code is brief, the adherence to conventions is implied.

17. **Fail** (90%): Confirm that the application has no console errors or warnings  
    The answer does not mention testing or runtime validation for console errors/warnings. Without evidence such as a test run or a note on debugging, we cannot confirm this criterion with full confidence.

18. **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code uses TypeScript features appropriately (types, interfaces, etc.)  
    The code utilizes TypeScript features like type annotations, interfaces, and proper usage of decorators.

19. **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the code does not contain any TODOs or commented-out code  
    No commented-out code or TODOs are present in the provided examples.

20. **Pass** (90%): Verify that the application follows single responsibility principle in component design  
    The guide recommends practices like proper component communication and service separation. While no in-depth example is provided to thoroughly assess adherence, the high-level instructions suggest an intention to follow the single responsibility principle. Therefore, it is marked as pass with slight reservation.
