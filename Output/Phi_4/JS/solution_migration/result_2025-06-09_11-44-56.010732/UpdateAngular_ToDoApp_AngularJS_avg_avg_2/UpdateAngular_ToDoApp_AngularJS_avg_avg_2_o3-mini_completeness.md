# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying the todo list  
  The answer instructs to generate a component named "todo-list" using Angular CLI.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for adding new todos  
  There is no explicit component dedicated solely to adding new todos. Although adding may be handled within another component, no separate "add-todo" component is mentioned.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for editing existing todos  
  The answer does not provide any dedicated component or clearly defined mechanism for editing todos.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application has a component for filtering todos  
  No component is defined or generated specifically for filtering todos within the provided guide.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application has a component for displaying todo count statistics  
  The guide does not include any component to display statistics such as the count of todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to add new todos  
  The NgRx action "addTodo" is defined and demonstrates the setup for adding new todos.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to edit existing todos  
  There is no implementation provided that would allow editing an existing todo.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to delete todos  
  The guide does not include any functionality (such as a delete action or service method) for deleting todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark todos as completed  
  The NgRx action "toggleTodo" is included, which suggests functionality to mark todos as completed or not.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to filter todos (All, Active, Completed)  
  Although filtering is mentioned in the context of updating the URL or UI filters, no concrete implementation for filtering by status is provided.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to mark all todos as complete/incomplete  
  There is no functionality or code snippet that addresses marking all todos as complete or incomplete.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application implements functionality to clear completed todos  
  No mechanism or code is provided that enables clearing or removing completed todos from the list.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application implements functionality to display the count of remaining todos  
  While todo count statistics are mentioned in the evaluation step, no corresponding functionality is implemented in the guide.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the application persists todos in localStorage  
  The provided TodoStorageService clearly implements methods to save todos to localStorage.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the application loads persisted todos on initialization  
  The TodoStorageService contains a getTodos method that shows loading persisted todos from localStorage.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application handles escape key press to cancel editing  
  The guide does not mention or include functionality that listens for the escape key to cancel an editing operation.

- **Fail** (80%): Verify that the application automatically focuses on the input field when editing a todo  
  A directive (TodoFocusDirective) is provided that attempts to call focus based on a condition. However, the directive uses a non-standard event ('changes') and is not explicitly tied to the editing process. This leaves some ambiguity about its effectiveness in ensuring focus during editing.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application maintains the same visual appearance as the original  
  There is no discussion or implementation details provided regarding the visual appearance compared to the original AngularJS application.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application handles empty todo titles appropriately  
  The guide does not include logic or validation to handle cases where todo titles might be empty.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application updates the URL based on the selected filter  
  There is no implementation shown for updating the URL in response to filter selection.
