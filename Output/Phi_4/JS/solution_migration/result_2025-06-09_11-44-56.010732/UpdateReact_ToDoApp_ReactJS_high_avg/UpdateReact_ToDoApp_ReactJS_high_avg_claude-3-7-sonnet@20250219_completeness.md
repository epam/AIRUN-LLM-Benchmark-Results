# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed

    The provided answer does not include any implementation showing how the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed. While it defines a Redux action `addTodo` that would handle this functionality, it doesn't provide the actual component code with event handlers for the Enter key press.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter

    The answer shows a Redux state that includes a `nowShowing` property and a `setNowShowing` action, but it doesn't provide the component code that would render the filtered list of todos based on this state.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos

    While the answer includes a Redux action called `toggleAll` that would handle this functionality, it doesn't show the component implementation that would call this action or the UI element that would trigger it.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted

    The answer defines Redux actions for these operations (`toggle`, `edit`, `destroy`), but it doesn't include the component code that implements these features in the UI.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode

    The answer doesn't include any implementation showing how double-clicking a todo item would trigger the edit mode. It only defines an `edit` action in Redux.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo

    The answer doesn't include the component code that would handle the Enter key press during editing to submit changes.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value

    The answer doesn't include the component code that would handle the Escape key press to cancel editing.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items

    The answer doesn't include any implementation of the footer component that would display the count of active items.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)

    While the answer mentions a `setNowShowing` action that could be used for filtering, it doesn't include the implementation of the footer component with the filter buttons.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos

    The answer includes a Redux action `clearCompleted` but doesn't show the UI implementation of this button.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence

    The answer mentions "Modern localStorage Handling" as a step but doesn't include any implementation showing how todos would be persisted in localStorage.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state

    The answer doesn't include any component code showing conditional rendering based on the todo state.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count

    The answer doesn't include any implementation showing how the application would pluralize text based on item count.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components

    The answer explicitly mentions breaking down large components into smaller, focused components in Step 4.1, and emphasizes component composition in Step 4.3. However, it doesn't provide concrete examples of this structure, which is why I'm not 100% confident.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality

    The answer mentions organizing files by feature or functionality in Step 4.2, but doesn't provide a specific file structure example, which reduces my confidence in this evaluation.
