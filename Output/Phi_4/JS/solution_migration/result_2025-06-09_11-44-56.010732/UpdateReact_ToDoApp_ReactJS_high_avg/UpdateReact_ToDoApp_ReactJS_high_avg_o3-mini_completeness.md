# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the todo input field creates new todos when Enter key is pressed  
  The provided answer does not include any explicit handling of an Enter key event on a todo input field or code that creates new todos on such an event.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the application displays todo items in a list according to the current filter  
  Although the answer defines a Redux state attribute (nowShowing) to hold the current filter, it does not show any code or component logic that renders a filtered list of todos based on that property.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the presence of functionality to toggle completion status of all todos  
  The answer includes a reducer named toggleAll in the Redux slice that updates the completion status for all todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that individual todo items can be toggled, edited, and deleted  
  The answer provides reducers (toggle, edit, destroy, and save) which indicate that toggling, editing, and deleting individual todo items are supported.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure that double-clicking a todo item enables editing mode  
  While the Redux slice includes an edit action to switch the editing mode, the answer does not describe any UI logic (such as a double-click event handler) that triggers editing on a todo item.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that pressing Enter submits an edited todo  
  There is no description or code sample demonstrating that pressing the Enter key while editing a todo item submits the changes.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that pressing Escape cancels editing and restores the original todo value  
  Even though a cancel action is defined in the Redux slice, the answer does not include any implementation of UI event handling (e.g., Escape key press) to cancel editing.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the footer displays the count of active items  
  The provided answer does not include any UI component code or logic for displaying the count of active todo items in the footer.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the footer includes filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  Although the Redux state contains a nowShowing property, there is no implementation detail or code that demonstrates the footer’s filter options.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the presence of a button to clear completed todos  
  The answer defines a clearCompleted reducer; however, there is no UI code or clear reference to a button in the application that triggers this functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the application maintains todos in localStorage for persistence  
  The answer only briefly mentions "modern localStorage Handling" without providing any implementation details or code that demonstrates persistence via localStorage.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that the application shows/hides UI elements conditionally based on todo state  
  No code or explanation is provided regarding conditional UI rendering that depends on the state of the todos.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that the application pluralizes 'item' text correctly based on count  
  There is no mention or implementation provided for pluralizing the “item” text based on the count of active todos in the UI.

- **Pass** (95%): Ensure the application has proper component composition with smaller, focused components  
  The answer advises splitting large components into smaller, focused ones and using composition patterns. However, no concrete examples are provided; hence, the pass is based on the recommendation rather than a demonstrated implementation.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify that files are organized by feature or functionality  
  The answer suggests grouping files by feature or functionality. Similar to the previous step, while the guidance is given, the lack of code examples means we pass the step based on the intent rather than explicit implementation.
