# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'
  
  The code includes a header element with the class "header" that contains an h1 element with the class "header-title" displaying "Virtual Piano".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons
  
  The code includes a div with class "btn-container" that contains two buttons: one for "Notes" and one for "Letters", with appropriate classes and onClick handlers to toggle between display modes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)
  
  The code maps through the pianoKeys array which includes both natural and sharp keys, rendering a PianoKey component for each one with the appropriate properties.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes
  
  Each PianoKey component is rendered with data-letter and data-note attributes that correspond to the keyboard letter and musical note.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked
  
  While the code includes audio functionality, there's an error in the implementation. The soundMapper object has duplicate entries where 'a' is used twice - once for 'a' and once for 'c'. Additionally, there might be path issues with the audio files as they're referenced as './assets/audio/' which may not be correctly configured in a React application.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)
  
  The code tracks active keys in the activeKeys state and passes an isActive prop to each PianoKey component. When a key is active, it adds the "piano-key-active" class to highlight the key.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes
  
  The code includes event listeners for keydown and keyup events, which are added in the useEffect hook. The handlers call playSound and update the activeKeys state accordingly.

- **Fail** (90%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked
  
  While the code includes a displayMode state and toggle functionality, there's an issue in the PianoKey component where it references displayMode directly without it being passed as a prop. This would cause a reference error in React.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes
  
  The code includes a fullscreen button with an onClick handler that calls toggleFullscreen, which uses the Fullscreen API to toggle fullscreen mode.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly
  
  The activeKeys state is an array that can contain multiple notes simultaneously, and the key event handlers correctly add and remove keys from this array as they are pressed and released.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys
  
  The code includes onMouseDown, onMouseUp, and onMouseOut handlers for each piano key, which should handle mouse drag functionality correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information
  
  The code includes a footer element with the class "footer" that contains a div with the class "footer-container" displaying "2020".
