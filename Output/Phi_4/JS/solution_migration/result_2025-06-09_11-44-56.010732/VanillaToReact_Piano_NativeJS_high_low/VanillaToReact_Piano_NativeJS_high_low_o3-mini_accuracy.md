# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application is built with React 18 and Create React App with TypeScript configuration  
  The answer clearly states the use of Create React App with TypeScript and targets React 18.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application uses TypeScript interfaces for audio mapping structure  
  The code defines an interface (Sound) in a separate file to type the audio mapping, satisfying this requirement.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify all components are implemented as functional components with React hooks  
  All components (App and PianoKey) are implemented as functional components with hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useRef.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure proper state management is used for UI interactions (useState, useEffect)  
  The application correctly manages state for active keys and display mode using useState, and uses useEffect to add/remove event listeners.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify keyboard event handlers are implemented at appropriate component levels  
  The code attaches keydown and keyup handlers on the document using useEffect. This is an appropriate approach for global key events.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm mouse interactions (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout, mousemove) are implemented using React synthetic events  
  While mouse events such as onMouseDown, onMouseUp, and onMouseOut are implemented, there is no implementation for an onMouseMove handler even though the evaluation step mentions it.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify audio resources are properly handled in the React environment  
  Audio playback is managed via a playSound function that resets the currentTime and plays the audio. The usage of new Audio() works, though there is slight uncertainty regarding asset path resolution in different React setups.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the fullscreen functionality uses React patterns and handles browser compatibility  
  The toggleFullscreen function correctly checks for the fullscreen element and calls requestFullscreen/exitFullscreen accordingly.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify conditional class application is implemented using React patterns  
  In the PianoKey component, the rendered content attempts to use a variable called displayMode (to determine whether to show letter or note) which is not passed as a prop or defined within the component. This oversight breaks the conditional rendering logic expected.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the code implements performance optimizations like React.memo where appropriate  
  Although the evaluation step suggests using React.memo (particularly for the PianoKey component), the provided code does not implement this optimization.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the application handles audio playback with proper React lifecycle considerations  
  The audio playback logic is encapsulated in helper functions and is integrated with state changes. There is a slight concern that additional cleanup might be considered for rapid replays, but overall it respects React lifecycle principles.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the code follows TypeScript strict typing throughout the application  
  The answer uses TypeScript interfaces and includes types on several components and variables. However, a few parts (such as event handler signatures and the missing prop for displayMode in PianoKey) could be more strictly typed.
