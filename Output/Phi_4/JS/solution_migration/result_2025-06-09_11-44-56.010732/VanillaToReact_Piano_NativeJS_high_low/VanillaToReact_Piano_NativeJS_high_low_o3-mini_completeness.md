# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application renders a header with the title 'Virtual Piano'  
  The App component renders a header element with an h1 that displays "Virtual Piano".

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application includes a button container with 'Notes' and 'Letters' toggle buttons  
  A div with the class "btn-container" contains two buttons labelled "Notes" and "Letters" that toggle the display mode.

- **Fail** (95%): Verify the piano component renders all piano keys (natural and sharp keys)  
  While the App component maps over an array of piano keys and renders a PianoKey component for each key, the PianoKey component references a variable "displayMode" that is not passed as a prop nor defined in its scope. This could lead to a runtime error and prevent the keys from rendering correctly.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each piano key has appropriate data attributes for letters and notes  
  Each rendered PianoKey includes the data attributes "data-letter" and "data-note", which correctly reflect the key’s letter and note.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify the application plays the correct audio when piano keys are clicked  
  The code defines a playSound function that uses a soundMapper to retrieve an HTMLAudioElement for each note and plays it on click. (There is a slight concern regarding the mapping of some notes to the same audio file, but the overall implementation for playing sound is in place.)

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application highlights keys when they are active (pressed)  
  Active keys are tracked in state and the corresponding PianoKey component conditionally applies the “piano-key-active” class when active.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application responds to keyboard input to play corresponding piano notes  
  The application registers document-level keydown and keyup event listeners which correctly map pressed keys to piano notes.

- **Fail** (95%): Ensure the application toggles between displaying notes and letters when corresponding buttons are clicked  
  Although the App component maintains a displayMode state and toggles it with the buttons, the PianoKey component incorrectly attempts to use a "displayMode" variable without receiving it as a prop. This likely prevents the keys from properly updating their label between notes and letters.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the fullscreen button toggles the application between normal and fullscreen modes  
  The toggleFullscreen function checks the document’s fullscreen state and requests or exits fullscreen, which should work as expected.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the application handles multiple simultaneous key presses correctly  
  The implementation uses an array (activeKeys) and event listeners to handle key presses. While the logic appears to support simultaneous input, corner cases such as duplicate entries are not thoroughly managed. However, the overall approach seems sufficient for handling multiple key presses.

- **Pass** (95%): Verify the application handles mouse drag functionality across piano keys  
  The PianoKey component is provided handlers for onMouseDown, onMouseUp, and onMouseOut to manage mouse drag interactions across keys.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application includes a footer with the year information  
  A footer element is present at the bottom of the App, containing a div with the year "2020".
