# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos
- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button
- **Fail** (90%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode

  While the code includes a label with an onDoubleClick event handler in TodoItem.tsx, the handler is empty with just a comment `{/* handle edit */}`. It doesn't actually implement the functionality to enable editing mode when double-clicking a todo item.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)
- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter
- **Fail** (90%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist

  While the code checks for completed todos and conditionally renders a 'Clear completed' button, the onClick handler is empty with just a comment `{/* clear completed */}`. It doesn't implement the actual functionality to clear completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos
- **Fail** (90%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once

  The toggle-all checkbox is present in the App.tsx code, but there's no implementation of the functionality to toggle all todos at once. The checkbox is rendered but not connected to any handler.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management

  While there's an input field for editing in the TodoItem component, the implementation of the edit mode functionality is incomplete. The double-click handler to enter edit mode is empty, and there's no code to handle focus management or to save edits on blur or Enter key press.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos
- **Fail** (90%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos

  Although there's a 'Clear completed' button in the Footer component, the onClick handler is empty, and there's no implementation of the functionality to clear all completed todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status
