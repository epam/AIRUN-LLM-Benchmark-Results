# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application includes a header with a title and input field for creating new todos  
  The App component contains a header section with an h1 element (“todos”) and includes the TodoInput component.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the application has a main section with a toggle-all checkbox and a list of todos  
  The main section is present and includes a “toggle-all” checkbox inside a container as well as the TodoList component displaying the todos.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure each todo item has a toggle checkbox, title display, and delete button  
  In the TodoItem component, there is an input of type checkbox (for toggling), a label to display the title, and a button with a “destroy” class for deletion.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify double-clicking a todo label enables editing mode  
  Although the TodoItem component attaches an onDoubleClick handler to the label, the handler’s implementation is empty (contains just a comment) and does not actually trigger an editing mode or manage input focus accordingly.

- **Pass** (90%): Confirm the application has filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed)  
  The Footer component renders filter links for “All”, “Active”, and “Completed” and highlights the selected filter based on the state. However, since the actual change of filtering (e.g. via routing or explicit events) is not fully implemented, there is slight uncertainty. Nonetheless, the UI elements for filtering are in place.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the footer displays the count of remaining todos with proper pluralization  
  The Footer component correctly calculates the active todo count and uses a conditional expression to display “item” or “items” appropriately.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the footer includes filter links that highlight the current selected filter  
  Each filter link in the Footer component conditionally applies a “selected” class based on the current filter state.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm the footer includes a 'Clear completed' button when completed todos exist  
  The Footer component conditionally renders a “Clear completed” button when there is at least one completed todo, even though its onClick handler is not implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the application allows creating new todos by typing and pressing Enter  
  The TodoInput component listens for the Enter key and dispatches an addTodo action when the input is non-empty.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows toggling the completion status of individual todos  
  The TodoItem component dispatches a toggleTodo action when the checkbox is changed, thus toggling the completed status.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application allows toggling all todos at once  
  Although a "toggle-all" checkbox is present in the main section of the App component, it is not wired up with any event handler or logic to toggle the state of all todo items.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application allows editing todos with proper focus management  
  While an editable input field is rendered and an onChange handler exists in TodoItem, the intended editing mode activation (via double-click) and focus management are not implemented.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application allows deleting individual todos  
  The TodoItem component provides a destroy button with an onClick handler that dispatches a destroyTodo action to delete a todo.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm the application allows clearing all completed todos  
  Although the Footer component renders a “Clear completed” button when there are completed todos, the onClick handler for this button is not implemented.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify the application properly filters todos based on their completion status  
  The TodoList component maps over the full list of todos without applying any filtering based on the current filter state. As a result, the actual filtering functionality is missing.
