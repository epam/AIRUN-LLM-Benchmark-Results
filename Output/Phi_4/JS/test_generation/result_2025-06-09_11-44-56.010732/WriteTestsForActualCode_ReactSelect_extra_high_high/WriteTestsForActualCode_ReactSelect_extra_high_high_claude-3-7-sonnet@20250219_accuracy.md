# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up in the test file
  
  The test file correctly imports necessary testing libraries:
  ```javascript
  import React from 'react';
  import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
  import { fireEvent, render } from '@testing-library/react';
  import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';
  ```
  
  The test file also shows proper Jest configuration with `jest.config.js` and `jest.setup.js` files, and includes the appropriate setup:
  ```javascript
  import '@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect';
  ```

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm that test cases are properly isolated and do not have interdependencies
  
  The provided code includes a duplication of the `render` import:
  ```javascript
  import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
  import { fireEvent, render } from '@testing-library/react';
  ```
  
  This indicates a lack of proper code organization and potentially leads to interdependencies between test cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that DOM events are simulated using proper React Testing Library methods
  
  The test file correctly uses React Testing Library methods for simulating events:
  ```javascript
  userEvent.type(combobox, '{arrowdown}');
  userEvent.type(combobox, '{arrowdown}{enter}');
  fireEvent.click(combobox);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that accessibility attributes are being tested appropriately
  
  The test file correctly tests accessibility attributes:
  ```javascript
  expect(getByRole('combobox')).toHaveAttribute('role', 'combobox');
  expect(combobox).toHaveAttribute('aria-expanded', 'true');
  ```

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure mocks are used for external dependencies where appropriate
  
  There is no evidence of mocking external dependencies in the provided test code, which would be necessary if the Select component uses external services or libraries.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify proper use of async/await for asynchronous testing where needed
  
  The test code does not include any async/await syntax for handling asynchronous operations, which would be needed for testing loading states, API calls, or delayed rendering.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all assertions use appropriate Jest matchers
  
  The test file uses appropriate Jest matchers:
  ```javascript
  expect(container).toMatchSnapshot();
  expect(getByRole('combobox')).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(getByRole('combobox')).toHaveAttribute('role', 'combobox');
  expect(combobox).toHaveFocus();
  expect(combobox).toHaveValue('Option 1');
  expect(combobox).toHaveAttribute('aria-expanded', 'true');
  ```

- **Fail** (100%): Verify that tests include proper cleanup after each test case
  
  The test file does not include any cleanup code such as `afterEach(() => { cleanup(); })` or similar, which is necessary to prevent test interference.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test descriptions clearly indicate what functionality is being tested
  
  The test descriptions are clear and descriptive:
  ```javascript
  it('renders with default props', () => {...});
  it('applies required props correctly', () => {...});
  it('has proper accessibility attributes', () => {...});
  it('navigates with arrow keys', () => {...});
  it('selects option with enter key', () => {...});
  it('opens menu on click', () => {...});
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the test file follows best practices for organizing test cases (describe/it blocks)
  
  The test file properly organizes tests using describe and it blocks:
  ```javascript
  describe('Select Component Rendering', () => {...});
  describe('Select Component User Interaction', () => {...});
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that all event handlers are tested using appropriate simulation methods
  
  The test file correctly simulates events to test handlers:
  ```javascript
  userEvent.type(combobox, '{arrowdown}');
  userEvent.type(combobox, '{arrowdown}{enter}');
  fireEvent.click(combobox);
  ```

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the test environment correctly simulates both mouse and keyboard interactions
  
  The test file correctly simulates both mouse and keyboard interactions:
  ```javascript
  // Keyboard interactions
  userEvent.type(combobox, '{arrowdown}');
  userEvent.type(combobox, '{arrowdown}{enter}');
  
  // Mouse interactions
  fireEvent.click(combobox);
  ```

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for touch events properly simulate mobile interactions
  
  The test file does not include any tests for touch events or mobile interactions, which would be important for ensuring the component works correctly on mobile devices.
