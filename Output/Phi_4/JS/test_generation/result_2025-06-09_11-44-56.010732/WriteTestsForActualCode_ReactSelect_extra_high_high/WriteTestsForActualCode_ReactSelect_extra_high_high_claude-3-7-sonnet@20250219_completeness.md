# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist

    The answer does include tests for basic component rendering with a test case that renders the component with default props:
    ```javascript
    it('renders with default props', () => {
      const { container } = render(<Select />);
      expect(container).toMatchSnapshot();
    });
    ```
    However, this test only checks if the component matches a snapshot, which is insufficient for comprehensive testing of default props rendering. It doesn't explicitly verify individual default properties or their effects on the component.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present

    The answer only partially addresses keyboard navigation testing. It includes tests for arrow down and enter key, but doesn't test tab, escape, arrow up, and other key interactions:
    ```javascript
    it('navigates with arrow keys', () => {
      const { getByRole } = render(<Select options={[{ value: '1', label: 'Option 1' }]} />);
      const combobox = getByRole('combobox');
      userEvent.type(combobox, '{arrowdown}');
      expect(combobox).toHaveFocus();
    });

    it('selects option with enter key', () => {
      const { getByRole } = render(<Select options={[{ value: '1', label: 'Option 1' }]} />);
      const combobox = getByRole('combobox');
      userEvent.type(combobox, '{arrowdown}{enter}');
      expect(combobox).toHaveValue('Option 1');
    });
    ```
    These tests are incomplete as they don't cover all required keyboard interactions.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)

    The answer only includes a basic test for clicking to open the menu:
    ```javascript
    it('opens menu on click', () => {
      const { getByRole } = render(<Select options={[{ value: '1', label: 'Option 1' }]} />);
      const combobox = getByRole('combobox');
      fireEvent.click(combobox);
      expect(combobox).toHaveAttribute('aria-expanded', 'true');
    });
    ```
    It lacks tests for hovering over options, clicking to select options, and other mouse-related interactions.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior

    The answer does not include any tests that specifically verify controlled vs. uncontrolled component behavior. There are no tests showing the component working with value/onChange props (controlled) or without them (uncontrolled).

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values

    The answer does not include tests for removing or clearing values. It only has a basic test for selecting a value using keyboard navigation, but doesn't test state changes comprehensively.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented

    The answer includes a test for opening the menu on click:
    ```javascript
    it('opens menu on click', () => {
      const { getByRole } = render(<Select options={[{ value: '1', label: 'Option 1' }]} />);
      const combobox = getByRole('combobox');
      fireEvent.click(combobox);
      expect(combobox).toHaveAttribute('aria-expanded', 'true');
    });
    ```
    This test explicitly verifies the menu opening behavior.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality

    The answer does not include any tests for filtering or searching functionality. There are no tests demonstrating typing in the select input to filter options.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist

    The answer does not include any tests for multi-select behavior. There are no tests verifying selection of multiple options or handling of multi-select specific functionalities.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility

    While the answer has a test that checks for the 'role' attribute:
    ```javascript
    it('has proper accessibility attributes', () => {
      const { getByRole } = render(<Select options={[{ value: '1', label: 'Option 1' }]} />);
      expect(getByRole('combobox')).toHaveAttribute('role', 'combobox');
    });
    ```
    This is insufficient for comprehensive ARIA testing. It only checks a single role attribute that's already verified by using getByRole and doesn't test other important accessibility attributes.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested

    The answer does not include tests for edge cases such as empty options, null values, or other boundary conditions.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states

    The answer does not include any tests for loading states or error states.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states

    The answer does not include tests for disabled options or the component in a disabled state.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance

    The answer does not include tests for large option sets or any performance-related testing.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested

    The answer has minimal focus testing in the keyboard navigation test:
    ```javascript
    it('navigates with arrow keys', () => {
      const { getByRole } = render(<Select options={[{ value: '1', label: 'Option 1' }]} />);
      const combobox = getByRole('combobox');
      userEvent.type(combobox, '{arrowdown}');
      expect(combobox).toHaveFocus();
    });
    ```
    However, this only tests that the combobox has focus after pressing the down arrow, not comprehensive focus management during various interactions.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering

    The answer does not include tests for placeholder text or value rendering.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations

    The answer does not include tests for custom formatOptionLabel implementations.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)

    The answer does not include tests for callback functions such as onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, or onMenuClose.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)

    The answer does not include tests for indicator components like dropdown indicators, clear buttons, or loading indicators.
