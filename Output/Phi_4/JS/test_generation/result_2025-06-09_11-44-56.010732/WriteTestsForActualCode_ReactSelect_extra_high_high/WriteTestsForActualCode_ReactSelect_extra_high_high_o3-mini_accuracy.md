# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up in the test file  
  The provided answer includes installation instructions, a proper Jest configuration file (jest.config.js), and a jest.setup.js that imports testing-library extensions.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that test cases are properly isolated and do not have interdependencies  
  The tests are wrapped in appropriate describe and it blocks, ensuring that each test is isolated from the others.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that DOM events are simulated using proper React Testing Library methods  
  The answer correctly uses fireEvent and userEvent from React Testing Library to simulate click, keyboard events, and user interactions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that accessibility attributes are being tested appropriately  
  The tests check for accessibility attributes such as the presence of the combobox role and the aria-expanded attribute, which confirms proper attention to accessibility.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure mocks are used for external dependencies where appropriate  
  There are no external dependencies in the Select component that require mocking. The absence of mocks is acceptable given the context.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify proper use of async/await for asynchronous testing where needed  
  The tests do not involve asynchronous logic. Thus, the absence of async/await usage is appropriate for the provided cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Check that all assertions use appropriate Jest matchers  
  The assertions (e.g., toMatchSnapshot, toBeInTheDocument, toHaveAttribute, toHaveFocus, toHaveValue) are suitable and correctly applied using Jest matchers.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that tests include proper cleanup after each test case  
  React Testing Library automatically cleans up the DOM after each test. The provided test code does not need additional cleanup steps.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure test descriptions clearly indicate what functionality is being tested  
  The test descriptions within the describe and it blocks clearly indicate the intent of each test, such as rendering, user interaction, and state management.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm that the test file follows best practices for organizing test cases (describe/it blocks)  
  The tests are well-organized using describe and it blocks, following best practices in structuring test cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate that all event handlers are tested using appropriate simulation methods  
  Both keyboard (using userEvent) and mouse interactions (using fireEvent) are appropriately simulated to test event handlers on the Select component.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the test environment correctly simulates both mouse and keyboard interactions  
  The answer provides tests that simulate keyboard interactions (arrow keys, enter key) as well as mouse interactions (click events), ensuring correct simulation of both.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for touch events properly simulate mobile interactions  
  The provided tests do not include any simulation of touch events for mobile interactions. This is a gap if the Select component is expected to support touch-based operations.
