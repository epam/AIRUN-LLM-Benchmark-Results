# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests for basic component rendering with default props exist  
  The provided answer contains a test case ("renders with default props") that renders the component and uses a snapshot, ensuring basic rendering is covered.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for keyboard navigation functionality (arrow keys, tab, enter, escape) are present  
  The tests only cover arrow key navigation and selecting an option with the enter key. Tests for tab and escape key functionality are missing.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate presence of tests for mouse interactions (clicking, hovering)  
  Although there is a test checking that the menu opens on click, there is no test for hover interactions.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm test coverage for both controlled and uncontrolled component behavior  
  While a section header for "Controlled and Uncontrolled Behavior" is mentioned, no actual tests are provided for these aspects.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values  
  The test for selecting an option via the enter key is present, but there are no tests for removing or clearing selections.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for menu opening/closing behavior are implemented  
  The provided tests only verify that the menu opens on click (via the aria-expanded attribute) and do not cover closing behavior.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate test coverage for option filtering and searching functionality  
  No test cases are provided to cover filtering or searching among options.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for multi-select behavior exist  
  There is no evidence of tests addressing multi-select functionality.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility  
  There are tests for ARIA attributes (e.g., role "combobox" and aria-expanded). However, dedicated tests ensuring screen reader compatibility are absent, which reduces full confidence.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure edge cases like empty options are tested  
  The answer does not include tests handling scenarios with empty options.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for loading and error states  
  No tests are provided that assess the componentâ€™s behavior in loading or error states.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for disabled options/states  
  There are no tests covering how disabled options or disabled states are handled by the component.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for large option sets to verify performance  
  There is no mention or test provided to ensure performance with large option sets.

- **Pass** (80%): Ensure focus management during interactions is properly tested  
  The test for keyboard navigation includes a check that the combobox obtains focus when navigated using arrow keys. However, focus management in other interactive scenarios is not deeply covered, which slightly lowers confidence.

- **Fail** (80%): Verify tests for placeholder and value rendering  
  Although there is a test checking that the combobox has a value after selection, there is no test addressing placeholder rendering. The partial check on value rendering does not fully satisfy the evaluation step.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure test coverage for custom formatOptionLabel implementations  
  There is no test case addressing the custom formatting (formatOptionLabel) functionality if it exists.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify callback function testing (onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose)  
  No tests are provided for verifying callback functions such as onChange, onInputChange, onMenuOpen, or onMenuClose.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests for indicator components (dropdown, clear, loading)  
  The answer does not include any tests for indicator components like the dropdown icon, clear button, or loading state indicators.
