# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources

    While the submitted answer includes a test file for the REST factory (`rest.spec.js`), the tests do not cover all defined resources. The tests only explicitly check for `blocks` and `comments` resources with generic assertions like "Add more assertions for each resource" rather than actually listing and testing all the resources that would be present in the factory.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly

    The test for the Page factory only checks three properties (`id`, `title`, and `description`) with a generic comment to "Add more assertions for each property" rather than explicitly testing all properties that would be initialized in the Page factory.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly

    Similar to the Page factory tests, the Users factory tests only check three properties (`id`, `username`, and `name`) with a placeholder comment rather than comprehensive validation of all user properties.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods

    The tests for the pageCtrl only cover initialization, `titleChange`, and `savePage` methods. Many other controller methods mentioned in the evaluation steps (like `autocompleteTags`, `saveLocal`, etc.) are not explicitly tested in the provided code.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller

    The tests do include verification of page initialization logic in the controller by checking that `$scope.page.id` equals `Page.id` and `$scope.page.title` equals `Page.title`. However, it doesn't verify all variables that would be initialized, only providing a placeholder comment to add more assertions.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation

    The test for the `titleChange` function does verify URL auto-generation by checking that when the title is changed to "New Title", the URL becomes "new-title".

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction

    There are no tests provided for the `saveLocal` function in the submitted answer.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality

    There are no tests provided for the `autocompleteTags` function in the submitted answer.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)

    While there is a test for the `savePage` function, it doesn't cover all conditional branches. It only tests a simple case where `REST.content.save` is called but doesn't verify the handling of new pages, duplicates, or updates.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types

    The submitted answer doesn't include tests for edge cases such as empty URLs or different page types.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly

    There are no tests provided for page deletion functionality in the submitted answer.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions

    There are no tests that verify handling of page versions or localStorage interactions beyond the initial setup.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components

    While the answer mentions setting up code coverage with Istanbul, it doesn't include actual tests that would achieve 80% code coverage across all components.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling

    There are no tests that validate event broadcasting and handling in the submitted answer.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality

    There are no tests that cover date handling and scheduling functionality in the submitted answer.
