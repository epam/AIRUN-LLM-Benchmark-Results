# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Validate existence of unit tests for the REST factory covering all defined resources  
  The tests for the REST factory only verify the existence of "blocks" and "comments" and hint at adding more assertions. However, not all defined REST resources are explicitly verified.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests for the Page factory verify all properties initialize correctly  
  The tests for the Page factory check properties such as id, title, and description, which appears to meet the requirement for property initialization.

- **Pass** (100%): Confirm tests for the Users factory validate all properties initialize correctly  
  The Users factory tests verify the initialization of properties (id, username, name), fulfilling this criterion.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify comprehensive tests for the pageCtrl controller covering all public methods  
  While several methods in the pageCtrl controller (like page initialization, titleChange, and savePage) are tested, the suite does not cover other public methods that might exist or are implied by further functionality.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure tests verify page initialization logic in the controller  
  There is a test that checks whether the page variables (such as id and title) are correctly initialized in the controller.

- **Pass** (100%): Validate tests for the titleChange function verify URL auto-generation  
  The tests for the titleChange function confirm that updating the title leads to the expected URL transformation.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests for the saveLocal function verify proper localStorage interaction  
  There are no tests present for a "saveLocal" function or for verifying interactions with localStorage.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests for the autocompleteTags function validate tag suggestion functionality  
  The provided tests do not include any coverage of an autocompleteTags function or its tag suggestion behavior.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests for the savePage function cover all conditional branches (new page, duplicate, update)  
  The test for the savePage function only spies on the REST content save call and does not handle different conditional scenarios like new pages, duplicates, or updates.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests cover edge cases like empty URLs and page types  
  No tests address edge cases such as handling empty URLs or various page types.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests verify the page deletion functionality works correctly  
  There is no evidence of tests covering the page deletion functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm tests check the handling of page versions and localStorage interactions  
  The tests do not address handling page versions nor do they verify interactions related to localStorage beyond what might be implied in other methods.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify tests achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components  
  Although instructions are provided for adding a coverage reporter using Istanbul, the tests as written do not guarantee an 80% code coverage threshold across all components.

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure tests validate proper event broadcasting and handling  
  There are no tests included that verify event broadcasting or how the controller handles events.

- **Fail** (100%): Validate tests cover the date handling and scheduling functionality  
  There is no test included for any date handling or scheduling logic, which is part of the evaluation criteria.
