# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering
- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos
- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos
  
  The provided code example for the TodoApp component testing does not include specific tests for toggling all todos functionality. The example shows rendering tests and adding new todos, but there is no test case that demonstrates toggling all todos as complete or incomplete.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos
  
  The provided test implementation for app.tsx does not include tests for filtering todos. There are no test cases that verify the filter functionality works correctly (e.g., showing all, active, or completed todos).

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
  
  The provided test code does not include any tests for the "Clear completed" functionality. There is no test case that verifies if completed todos are properly removed when this action is triggered.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering
  
  While the answer mentions creating a test file `todoItem.test.tsx`, it does not provide any implementation details or examples of tests for rendering the TodoItem component. The comment "Add more tests for lifecycle methods, event handling, etc." suggests this was intended to be included but was not actually demonstrated.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos
  
  The answer does not provide any implementation details for testing toggling, destroying, and editing todos in the TodoItem component. Only the file name `todoItem.test.tsx` is mentioned without actual test cases.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events
  
  The answer does not provide any implementation details for testing keyboard event handling in the TodoItem component. There is no demonstration of testing keyboard interactions like Escape or Enter key presses.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts
  
  The answer mentions creating a test file `footer.test.tsx`, but does not provide any implementation details or examples of tests for rendering the Footer component with different todo counts.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation
  
  The answer does not provide any implementation details for testing filter navigation in the Footer component. Only the file name is mentioned without actual test cases.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
  
  The answer does not provide any implementation details for testing the "Clear completed" functionality in the Footer component. Only the file name is mentioned without actual test cases.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos
  
  The answer includes a test for adding a todo in the TodoModel, and explicitly mentions "Add more tests for toggle, destroy, save, etc." indicating an understanding of the need to test these operations.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions
  
  The provided test implementation for TodoModel does not include tests for the subscribe and inform functions. These are likely important for the observer pattern implementation, but no tests are demonstrated for this functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos
  
  The provided TodoModel test implementation does not include tests for clearing completed todos. There is no test case that verifies if completed todos are properly removed from the model.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation
  
  While the answer mentions mocking Utils, it does not provide any implementation details or examples of tests for the uuid generation function in the Utils module.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality
  
  The answer does not provide any implementation details for testing the pluralize functionality in the Utils module.

- **Pass** (80%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations
  
  The answer includes a mock implementation for localStorage, which suggests an understanding of the need to test store operations. However, it doesn't explicitly show test cases for the Utils.store functionality, just the mock setup. I'm less confident in this pass because while the groundwork is laid, actual tests aren't demonstrated.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function
  
  The answer does not provide any implementation details for testing the extend function in the Utils module.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx
  
  The answer consistently uses the proper naming convention for test files, using `[filename].test.tsx` for component tests and `[filename].test.ts` for non-component tests.

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data
  
  The answer does not include any test fixtures or sample todo data that could be reused across tests. There is no demonstration of creating standardized test data.

- **Pass** (90%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented
  
  The answer includes a mock implementation for the Router, which shows an understanding of mocking routing functionality. However, it doesn't provide detailed test cases that verify routing behavior, just the mock setup.
