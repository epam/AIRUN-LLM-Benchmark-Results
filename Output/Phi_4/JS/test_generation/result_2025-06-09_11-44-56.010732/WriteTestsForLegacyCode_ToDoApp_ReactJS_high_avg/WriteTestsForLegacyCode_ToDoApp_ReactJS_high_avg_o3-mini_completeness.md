# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for component rendering  
  The sample test file (app.test.tsx) includes a test that renders the TodoApp component and checks for the presence of the text "todos", confirming the component renders.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for adding new todos  
  The sample test in app.test.tsx titled "adds a new todo on Enter key press" demonstrates that adding a new todo is being tested.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for toggling all todos  
  There is no test provided in app.test.tsx that verifies the functionality for toggling all todos.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for filtering todos  
  The provided test file does not include any tests that check the filtering functionality of the todos.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify app.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  No tests are present that address the clearing of completed todos within the app.test.tsx file.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for rendering  
  The answer does not include a todoItem.test.tsx file or any tests focused on the rendering of individual todo items.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for toggling, destroying and editing todos  
  There are no tests provided for the todoItem component covering toggling, destroying, or editing functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoItem.tsx test file includes tests for handling keyboard events  
  The sample answer does not include tests in a todoItem.test.tsx file that check keyboard event handling.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for rendering with different counts  
  There is no footer.test.tsx file or any tests provided that test the rendering of the footer with various todo counts.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for filter navigation  
  The answer does not include any tests for filter navigation within a footer.test.tsx file.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify footer.tsx test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  No tests are included to confirm the footer component handles clearing completed todos.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for adding, toggling, saving and destroying todos  
  Although the todoModel.test.ts file includes a test for adding a todo, it does not cover toggling, saving, or destroying todos.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for subscribe and inform functions  
  The provided tests for TodoModel do not include any checks for the subscribe and inform functions.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify todoModel.ts test file includes tests for clearing completed todos  
  There are no tests in todoModel.test.ts addressing the clearing of completed todos.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for uuid generation  
  The answer does not include a utils.test.ts or any tests that validate uuid generation functionality.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for pluralize functionality  
  There are no tests provided for the pluralize functionality in utils.ts.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for store (localStorage) operations  
  Although a localStorage mock is set up in setupTests.ts, there are no dedicated tests in a utils.ts test file for store operations.

- **Fail** (100%): Verify utils.ts test file includes tests for extend function  
  The answer does not include any tests for an extend function from utils.ts.

- **Fail** (90%): Verify tests follow proper naming convention: [filename].test.tsx  
  While most test files use the .test.tsx naming convention (app.test.tsx, todoItem.test.tsx, footer.test.tsx), the todoModel test file is named todoModel.test.ts (without the “x”). This inconsistency suggests a failure to strictly follow the naming convention.  
  (Confidence is 90% because in some settings .test.ts might be acceptable for non-JSX files, but the evaluation requirement specifically calls for .test.tsx.)

- **Fail** (100%): Confirm test fixtures are created for sample todo data  
  There is no indication in the answer that test fixtures or sample todo data have been created for testing purposes.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify routing functionality tests with appropriate mocks are implemented  
  The answer includes a mock implementation for the router in app.test.tsx, thereby satisfying this requirement.
