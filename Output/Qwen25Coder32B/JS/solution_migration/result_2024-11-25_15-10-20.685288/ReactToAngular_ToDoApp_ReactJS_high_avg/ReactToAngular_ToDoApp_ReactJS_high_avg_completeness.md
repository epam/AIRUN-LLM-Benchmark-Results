# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that the main component displays the header with input for new todos.
- **Pass**: The `app.component.html` contains a header with an input field for new todos.

### Step 2: Ensure that adding a new todo item works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `handleNewTodoKeyDown` method in `app.component.ts` handles adding new todos when the Enter key is pressed.

### Step 3: Verify that the todo list displays all added todo items.
- **Pass**: The `app.component.html` uses `*ngFor` to iterate over `todos$` and display each todo item using the `app-todo-item` component.

### Step 4: Confirm that toggle functionality works for marking todos as completed.
- **Pass**: The `toggle` method in `app.component.ts` dispatches the `ToggleTodo` action, and the `todo-item.component.html` handles the change event to emit the toggle event.

### Step 5: Check that editing a todo item works and updates the todo item correctly.
- **Pass**: The `edit` and `save` methods in `app.component.ts` handle editing and saving todos. The `todo-item.component.ts` handles the edit and save events.

### Step 6: Ensure that deleting a todo item removes it from the list.
- **Pass**: The `destroy` method in `app.component.ts` dispatches the `DestroyTodo` action, and the `todo-item.component.html` handles the click event to emit the destroy event.

### Step 7: Verify that the footer correctly displays the count of active items.
- **Pass**: The `app-todo-footer` component in `app.component.html` receives the `activeTodoCount$` observable and displays the count.

### Step 8: Confirm that the footer's clear completed button works and removes completed items.
- **Pass**: The `clearCompleted` method in `app.component.ts` dispatches the `ClearCompleted` action, and the `app-todo-footer` component handles the click event to emit the clearCompleted event.

### Step 9: Check that filtering todos by "all", "active", and "completed" works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `app-todo-footer` component in `app.component.html` uses the `nowShowing$` observable to apply the correct filter class.

### Step 10: Ensure that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `toggleAll` method in `app.component.ts` dispatches the `ToggleAll` action, and the `app.component.html` handles the change event to call the `toggleAll` method.

### Step 11: Check that the application persists todos to local storage and reloads them correctly.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include functionality to persist todos to local storage or reload them. The `Utils.store` method is defined but not used in the application.
