## Steps

### Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
- **Pass**: The input field for creating a new todo is present in `TodoApp.tsx`. The `handleNewTodoKeyDown` function handles the Enter key press and dispatches the `addTodo` action with the input value.

### Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
- **Pass**: The `shownTodos` array in `TodoApp.tsx` filters the todos based on the current filter state (`ALL_TODOS`, `ACTIVE_TODOS`, `COMPLETED_TODOS`).

### Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
- **Pass**: The `handleToggleAll` function in `TodoApp.tsx` dispatches the `toggleAll` action to toggle the completion status of all todos.

### Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
- **Pass**: Each todo item in `TodoItem.tsx` has functionality to toggle (`onToggle`), edit (`onEdit`), and delete (`onDestroy`).

### Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
- **Pass**: The `handleEdit` function in `TodoItem.tsx` starts editing on double click. The `handleKeyDown` function handles Enter and Esc key presses to submit or cancel editing, respectively.

### Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFooter.tsx` component displays the count of active items, provides filter links, and includes a button to clear completed items.

### Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFooter.tsx` component includes a "Clear completed" button that dispatches the `clearCompleted` action.
