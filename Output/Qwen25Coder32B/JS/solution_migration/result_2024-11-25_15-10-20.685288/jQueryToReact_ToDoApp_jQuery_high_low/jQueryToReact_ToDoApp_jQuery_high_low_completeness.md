# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
- **Pass**: The input field for creating a new todo is present in the `App.tsx` file. The `handleNewTodoKeyDown` function handles the Enter key press and dispatches the `addTodo` action with the new todo value from the state.

### Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
- **Pass**: The `App.tsx` file includes logic to filter todos based on the current filter state (`filteredTodos`). The filtered todos are then displayed in a list.

### Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
- **Pass**: The `App.tsx` file includes a checkbox input with the `handleToggleAllChange` function that dispatches the `toggleAll` action to toggle the completion status of all todos.

### Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItem.tsx` file includes functionality to toggle (`handleToggleChange`), edit (`handleEditChange`, `handleEditKeyDown`, `handleBlur`), and delete (`handleDestroy`) each todo item.

### Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItem.tsx` file includes functionality to start editing on double click (`handleDoubleClick`), submit on Enter key press (`handleEditKeyDown`), and reset on Esc key press (`handleEditKeyDown`).

### Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
- **Pass**: The `Footer.tsx` file displays the count of active items (`activeTodoCount`), includes filter functionality (`handleFilterClick`), and allows clearing completed items (`onClearCompleted`).

### Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
- **Pass**: The `Footer.tsx` file includes a button to clear completed items, which dispatches the `destroyCompletedTodos` action.
