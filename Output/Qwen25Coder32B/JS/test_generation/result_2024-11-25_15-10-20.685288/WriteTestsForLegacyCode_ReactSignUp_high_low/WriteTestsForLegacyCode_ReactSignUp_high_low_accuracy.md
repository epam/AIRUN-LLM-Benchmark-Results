# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that the tests are isolated and do not depend on each other.
**Pass**: Each test case is independent and does not rely on the outcome of other tests. The `beforeEach` function ensures a fresh setup for each test.

### Step 2: Validate that the tests adhere to best practices for unit testing.
**Pass**: The tests follow best practices, such as using `beforeEach` for setup, testing one thing at a time, and using mocks and stubs for external dependencies.

### Step 3: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
**Pass**: The code does not contain any unnecessary duplicates and adheres to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

### Step 4: Verify that the testing environment is set up correctly.
**Pass**: The testing environment is set up correctly with the necessary configurations in `setupTests.js`.

### Step 5: Check if a testing library for JavaScript (such as Jest) has been chosen.
**Pass**: Jest is chosen as the testing library, as indicated by the dependencies in the `package.json` file.

### Step 6: Validate that dependencies are mocked where necessary, such as API calls.
**Pass**: Dependencies, such as API calls, are mocked using `sinon` to ensure tests are isolated and do not make real network requests.

### Step 7: Verify that the test coverage for the code is at least 80%.
**Fail**: The provided information does not include test coverage metrics. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed if the test coverage is at least 80%.

### Step 8: Confirm that the package.json file includes necessary dependencies and scripts for running tests.
**Pass**: The `package.json` file includes necessary dependencies for testing, such as `enzyme`, `jest`, `redux-mock-store`, and `sinon`.

### Step 9: Confirm that the tests use the proper methods and assertions from the chosen testing library.
**Pass**: The tests use proper methods and assertions from Jest and Enzyme, such as `expect`, `shallow`, and `mount`.
