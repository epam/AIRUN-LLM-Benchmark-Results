# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Ensure that the application uses `$resource` objects for RESTful API communication.**
   - **Pass**: The provided code includes a REST Factory (`rest.js`) that uses AngularJS `$resource` objects to interact with various RESTful API endpoints.

2. **Verify that the application saves page changes to local storage.**
   - **Pass**: The Page Controller (`pageCtrl.js`) manages local storage for unsaved changes, ensuring that page changes are saved locally.

3. **Confirm that the application initializes the page type correctly.**
   - **Pass**: The Page Controller initializes page variables, including the page type, ensuring that the page type is set correctly.

4. **Validate that the application manages local storage for unsaved changes.**
   - **Pass**: The Page Controller handles local storage for unsaved changes, allowing users to recover unsaved data from previous sessions.

5. **Verify that the application handles errors during saving or updating pages.**
   - **Fail**: The provided code does not explicitly mention error handling during the saving or updating of pages. Error handling mechanisms should be implemented to manage such scenarios.

6. **Confirm that the application broadcasts events to update page variables and settings when necessary.**
   - **Fail**: The provided code does not explicitly mention broadcasting events to update page variables and settings. Event broadcasting should be implemented to ensure that changes are propagated correctly.

7. **Validate that the application uses promises and callbacks for asynchronous operations.**
   - **Pass**: The application uses AngularJS `$resource` objects, which support promises for handling asynchronous operations.

8. **Validate that the application broadcasts notifications for various operations (e.g., page saving, updating, deleting).**
   - **Fail**: The provided code does not explicitly mention broadcasting notifications for various operations. Notifications should be implemented to inform users of the status of their actions.

9. **Verify that the application supports scalability and maintainability through modular design.**
   - **Pass**: The application uses AngularJS factories and controllers, promoting a modular design that supports scalability and maintainability.

10. **Confirm that the application optimizes performance through efficient API usage and local storage management.**
    - **Pass**: The application uses local storage for unsaved changes and makes asynchronous requests to the server, optimizing performance.

### Summary

- **Total number of steps evaluated**: 10
- **Number of passed steps**: 7
- **Number of failed steps**: 3

### Conclusion

The provided code demonstrates a good understanding of AngularJS components and their interactions within a content management system. However, there are areas that need improvement, particularly in error handling, event broadcasting, and user notifications. Addressing these issues will enhance the robustness and user experience of the application.
