# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Verify that the code implements a signup form for a React application using Redux and `redux-form`.**
   - **Pass**: The code defines a React component for a user signup form and uses `redux-form` to handle form state, validation, and submission.

2. **Check for synchronous and asynchronous validation of form fields.**
   - **Pass**: The code includes both synchronous and asynchronous validation for the form fields.

3. **Confirm the presence of synchronous validation for name, email, and password fields.**
   - **Pass**: Synchronous validation is present for the name, email, and password fields.

4. **Ensure that asynchronous validation checks if the name and email are already in use via API calls.**
   - **Pass**: Asynchronous validation checks the uniqueness of the name and email via API calls.

5. **Ensure the form submission sends user data (name, email, password) to the backend API.**
   - **Pass**: The form submission sends user data to the backend API.

6. **Verify that successful signup dispatches an action to update the application state.**
   - **Pass**: Upon successful signup, an action is dispatched to update the application state.

7. **Check that real-time feedback on form validation errors is provided.**
   - **Pass**: Real-time feedback on form validation errors is provided.

8. **Ensure success or error messages are displayed based on form submission results.**
   - **Pass**: Success or error messages are displayed based on form submission results.

9. **Confirm the presence of a link for existing users to navigate to the login page.**
   - **Fail**: The provided code does not explicitly mention a link for existing users to navigate to the login page.

10. **Determine if users can enter their name, email, and password into input fields.**
    - **Pass**: Users can enter their name, email, and password into the input fields.

11. **Verify that real-time validation feedback is provided as users fill out the form.**
    - **Pass**: Real-time validation feedback is provided as users fill out the form.

12. **Check if the form submission process includes displaying validation errors or success messages.**
    - **Pass**: The form submission process includes displaying validation errors or success messages.

13. **Assess if the code enables new users to create an account on the platform.**
    - **Pass**: The code enables new users to create an account on the platform.

14. **Check if user information (name, email, password) is collected for account creation.**
    - **Pass**: User information (name, email, password) is collected for account creation.

15. **Determine if the code encourages user engagement by highlighting platform benefits.**
    - **Fail**: The provided code does not explicitly mention highlighting platform benefits to encourage user engagement.

16. **Verify that the code ensures data integrity by validating user inputs both synchronously and asynchronously.**
    - **Pass**: The code ensures data integrity by validating user inputs both synchronously and asynchronously.

17. **Ensure it prevents duplicate accounts by checking for existing email or name.**
    - **Pass**: The code prevents duplicate accounts by checking for existing email or name.
