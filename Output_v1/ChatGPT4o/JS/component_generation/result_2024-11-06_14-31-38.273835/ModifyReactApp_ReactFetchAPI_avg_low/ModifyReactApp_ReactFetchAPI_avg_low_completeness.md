# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps:

1. **Check that a loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.**
   - **Pass**: The code includes a loading state (`loading`) and displays a "Loading..." message when `loading` is `true`.

2. **Verify that the loader does not hide the search input when data is loading.**
   - **Pass**: The search input field is always rendered, regardless of the loading state.

3. **Validate that a request with an empty search term is sent on the initial render.**
   - **Pass**: The `useEffect` hook triggers `debouncedFetchCharacters` with an empty search term on initial render.

4. **Verify that the search input field is present.**
   - **Pass**: The search input field is present in the JSX returned by the `CharacterList` component.

5. **Ensure that the character search functionality is implemented.**
   - **Pass**: The search functionality is implemented using the `handleSearchChange` function and the `searchTerm` state.

6. **Ensure that the API request includes the search term as a query parameter.**
   - **Pass**: The `fetchCharacters` function includes the search term as a query parameter in the API request.

7. **Validate that the data is loading on initial app load with empty query and then when the search term changes.**
   - **Pass**: The `useEffect` hook ensures data is fetched on initial load and whenever the `searchTerm` changes.

8. **Ensure that the debounced fetch function prevents unnecessary API requests.**
   - **Pass**: The `debouncedFetchCharacters` function uses `lodash.debounce` to delay the API request, preventing excessive requests.

9. **Confirm that the character list is updated based on the search results.**
   - **Pass**: The character list is updated based on the search results stored in the `characters` state.

10. **Validate that the application handles API request errors.**
    - **Pass**: The `fetchCharacters` function includes a `try-catch` block to handle API request errors.

11. **Ensure that the user experience remains smooth without backend overloads.**
    - **Pass**: The use of debouncing and proper state management ensures a smooth user experience without overloading the backend.
