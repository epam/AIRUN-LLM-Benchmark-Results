# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps:

1. **Ensure that the application uses `$resource` objects for RESTful API communication.**
   - **Pass**: The application uses `$resource` objects to communicate with the backend via RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on pages, revisions, tags, and extras.

2. **Verify that the application saves page changes to local storage.**
   - **Pass**: The application saves unsaved page changes to the browser's local storage, ensuring that users do not lose their work if they navigate away from the page.

3. **Confirm that the application initializes the page type correctly.**
   - **Pass**: The application initializes the page type correctly by allowing users to select a page type from a dropdown menu during page creation or editing.

4. **Validate that the application manages local storage for unsaved changes.**
   - **Pass**: The application checks for unsaved versions in local storage and prompts the user to either discard or use the newer version, effectively managing local storage for unsaved changes.

5. **Verify that the application handles errors during saving or updating pages.**
   - **Pass**: The application includes error handling mechanisms that notify users of errors when saving or updating pages, ensuring that users are aware of any issues.

6. **Confirm that the application broadcasts events to update page variables and settings when necessary.**
   - **Pass**: The application broadcasts events to update page variables and settings, ensuring that changes are reflected across the system.

7. **Validate that the application uses promises and callbacks for asynchronous operations.**
   - **Pass**: The application uses promises and callbacks to handle asynchronous operations, ensuring that tasks such as API calls are managed efficiently.

8. **Validate that the application broadcasts notifications for various operations (e.g., page saving, updating, deleting).**
   - **Pass**: The application broadcasts notifications for various operations, such as page saving, updating, and deleting, to keep users informed of the status of their actions.

9. **Verify that the application supports scalability and maintainability through modular design.**
   - **Pass**: The application is designed using AngularJS, which supports modular design, making it easier to maintain and scale the system.

10. **Confirm that the application optimizes performance through efficient API usage and local storage management.**
    - **Pass**: The application optimizes performance by using local storage for version control and making efficient API calls, although there is room for further optimization, such as reducing the number of API calls and implementing caching for tag autocomplete.
