# Evaluation Report

## Step 1: Confirm that the state slices for page and user are correctly defined and managed.
- **Pass**: The state slices for `page` and `user` are correctly defined using `createSlice` from `@reduxjs/toolkit`. The initial states are properly set, and the reducers `setPage`, `resetPage`, `setUser`, and `resetUser` are correctly implemented.

## Step 2: Verify that API service functions are correctly defined and used.
- **Pass**: The API service functions are correctly defined using `axios`. Functions for `getContent`, `saveContent`, `updateContent`, `deleteContent`, `getTags`, `saveTag`, `deleteTags`, `saveExtras`, and `deleteExtras` are properly implemented and used in the `PageEditor` component.

## Step 3: Ensure that the application correctly handles all the functionalities from the original Angular code.
- **Pass**: The application handles functionalities such as saving, deleting, updating content, and managing tags. The `PageEditor` component includes methods for handling these actions, and the state is managed using Redux.

## Step 4: Verify that all functionalities like save, delete, update, and tag management are working correctly.
- **Pass**: The `PageEditor` component includes methods `handleSave`, `handleDelete`, `handleAutocompleteTags`, and `handleSelectSuggestion` to manage saving, deleting, updating, and tag management. These methods interact with the API service functions and update the Redux state accordingly.

## Step 5: Ensure that the application performs all CRUD operations correctly.
- **Pass**: The application performs all CRUD operations correctly. The `PageEditor` component includes methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting content, and these methods are correctly implemented and interact with the API service functions.

## Step 6: Verify that the application handles local storage and state persistence correctly.
- **Fail**: The `PageEditor` component checks for unsaved versions in local storage, but the `elements` array includes keys that do not match the `PageState` interface (e.g., `publish`, `scheduleDate`). This could lead to issues in detecting unsaved versions.

## Summary
- **Total number of steps evaluated**: 6
- **Number of passed steps**: 5
- **Number of failed steps**: 1

Overall, the application is well-implemented, but there is a minor issue with handling local storage and state persistence that needs to be addressed.
