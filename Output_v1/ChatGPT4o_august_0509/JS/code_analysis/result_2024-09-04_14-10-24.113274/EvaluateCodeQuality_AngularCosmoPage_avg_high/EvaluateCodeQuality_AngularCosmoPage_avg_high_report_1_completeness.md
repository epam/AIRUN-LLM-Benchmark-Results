# Evaluation Report

## Readability

### 1. Inconsistent Naming Conventions
**Pass**: The code uses inconsistent naming conventions, such as mixing camelCase and snake_case. The provided example and fixed issue demonstrate the problem and solution effectively.

### 2. Long and Complex Functions
**Pass**: The `savePage` function is identified as too long and complex. The solution provided breaks it down into smaller, more focused functions, improving readability.

## Maintainability

### 1. Hardcoded Strings
**Pass**: The code contains hardcoded strings, which are identified and replaced with constants for better maintainability.

### 2. Repeated Code
**Pass**: Repeated code is identified, and a reusable function is suggested to improve maintainability.

## Performance

### 1. Inefficient DOM Manipulation
**Pass**: The use of AngularJS's two-way data binding is identified as a performance issue. The solution suggests using one-time bindings where appropriate.

### 2. Unnecessary Watchers
**Pass**: The code contains unnecessary watchers, and the solution suggests optimizing them for better performance.

## Accessibility

### 1. Missing ARIA Attributes
**Pass**: The code lacks ARIA attributes, and the solution suggests adding them to improve accessibility.

### 2. Inconsistent Use of Labels

## Best Practices

### 1. Use of Deprecated AngularJS Features
**Pass**: The code uses deprecated AngularJS features, and the solution suggests migrating to a more modern framework like Angular (2+) or React.

### 2. Lack of Dependency Injection
**Pass**: The code directly accesses services, making it harder to test and maintain. The solution suggests using dependency injection for better modularity and testability.
