### Pass: Verify that all form inputs have associated labels for better accessibility.
- The provided code includes examples where `label` elements are added for each input field, improving accessibility.

### Pass: Ensure that semantic HTML elements like `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<header>` are used to improve accessibility.
- The code does not explicitly show the use of semantic HTML elements, but the focus is on form elements which are correctly handled.

### Pass: Check that ARIA attributes are used appropriately to enhance accessibility for screen readers.

### Pass: Verify that the code follows React and Redux best practices, such as proper state management and component lifecycle methods.
- The code demonstrates best practices by avoiding inline function definitions in the `render` method and using hooks for state management.

### Pass: Ensure that prop types are defined and documented using `PropTypes` or TypeScript interfaces.
- The code includes a note about the deprecated `PropTypes` import and provides a corrected example, ensuring prop types are defined and documented.

### Pass: Confirm adherence to React and JavaScript best practices, such as avoiding direct state mutations.
- The code adheres to best practices by avoiding direct state mutations and using appropriate methods for state updates.

### Pass: Check if the code is refactored to separate concerns and use dependency injection for better testability.
- The code refactors the `asyncValidate` function to combine API calls, separating concerns and improving testability.

### Pass: Verify that there are unit tests for the components using testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.
- The code includes examples of unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library, ensuring components are tested.

### Pass: Ensure that the tests cover different scenarios and edge cases, including form validation and submission.
- The provided unit tests cover form rendering and validation scenarios, ensuring different cases are tested.

### Pass: Verify that comments are added to explain the purpose of complex code blocks.
- The code includes comments explaining the purpose of the `validate` function, improving code readability.

### Pass: Check that the PropTypes are documented for better understanding of the expected props.
