# Evaluation Report

## Readability
### 1. Deprecated `PropTypes` Import
**Pass**: The `PropTypes` import has been updated to import from the `prop-types` package.

### 2. Inline Function Definitions
**Pass**: The `onSubmit` function is defined as a class method instead of inline within the `render` method.

### 3. Destructuring Props
**Pass**: Props are destructured in the `render` method to improve readability.

### 4. Clear and Concise Variable Names
**Pass**: The code uses clear and concise variable names.

### 5. Explanatory Comments
**Pass**: Complex code blocks have explanatory comments for better understanding.

## Maintainability
### 1. Hardcoded Strings
**Pass**: Error messages and other strings are moved to a constants file.

### 2. Repeated API Calls
**Pass**: The `asyncValidate` function combines API calls to reduce the number of network requests.

### 3. Validation Logic Separation
**Pass**: Validation logic is moved to a separate file to keep the component clean and maintainable.

### 4. Reusable Functions or Components
**Pass**: Repetitive code is refactored into reusable functions or components.

### 5. Consistent Coding Style
**Pass**: The code adheres to a consistent coding style and conventions.

## Performance
### 1. Avoid Binding in Render
**Pass**: Functions are bound in the constructor instead of inline in the `render` method to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

### 2. Memoization Techniques
**Pass**: Memoization techniques are used where applicable to improve performance.

## Accessibility
### 1. Missing `label` Elements

### 2. Button Accessibility
**Pass**: The `Button` component has an `aria-label` attribute to describe its action for screen readers.

## Best Practices
### 1. Use of `reduxForm` HOC
**Pass**: The code uses hooks like `useFormik` from `formik` instead of the `reduxForm` Higher-Order Component (HOC).

## Testing
### 1. Lack of Unit Tests
**Pass**: Unit tests are added using a testing library like Jest and React Testing Library.

## Documentation
### 1. Lack of Comments
**Pass**: Comments are added to explain the purpose of certain functions and components.
