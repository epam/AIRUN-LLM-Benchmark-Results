### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Pass**: Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.
   - All imports in the provided code are used appropriately.

2. **Pass**: Ensure the codebase is structured and follows React best practices (state, hooks, effects).
   - The codebase is well-structured, using hooks like `useEffect`, `useState`, and `useDispatch` effectively.

3. **Pass**: Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.
   - The use of dependencies in `useEffect` and state management appears to be correct, minimizing unnecessary re-renders.

4. **Pass**: Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.
   - The code uses React 18.x and TypeScript, as indicated in `package.json`.

5. **Pass**: Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.
   - There are no apparent console errors or warnings in the provided code.

6. **Pass**: Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.
   - The app uses React state and props to manage form values, avoiding direct DOM access.

7. **Pass**: Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React’s virtual DOM.
   - The app does not directly manipulate the DOM; it relies on React's virtual DOM.

8. **Pass**: Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React’s state and props.
   - The app does not overuse refs; it uses state and props appropriately.

9. **Pass**: Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.
   - The state and prop changes are managed efficiently, avoiding excessive re-renders.

10. **Pass**: Ensure the code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility.
    - The code is decomposed into components like `PageEditor` and `App`, each with a single responsibility.

11. **Pass**: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
    - The code follows DRY principles, with no apparent duplication.

12. **Pass**: App does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.
    - This is a repeat of step 6 and is already confirmed as passed.

13. **Pass**: App has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.
    - The provided code maintains a consistent DOM tree structure.

14. **Pass**: Ensure that the store is properly configured and provided to the app.
    - The store is configured using `configureStore` and provided to the app via `Provider`.

15. **Pass**: Verify that the code is migrated to React 18.x.
    - The code uses React 18.x, as indicated in `package.json`.

16. **Pass**: Check that TypeScript is used in the translated code.
    - The code is written in TypeScript.

17. **Pass**: Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for managing local data.
    - The code uses `createSlice` from Redux Toolkit for state management.

18. **Pass**: Ensure that the code is split into separate components.
    - The code is split into components like `PageEditor` and `App`.

19. **Pass**: Validate that the code does not contain any TODOs.
    - There are no TODOs in the provided code.

20. **Pass**: Check that the code is optimized.
    - The code appears to be optimized, with efficient state management and component structure.
