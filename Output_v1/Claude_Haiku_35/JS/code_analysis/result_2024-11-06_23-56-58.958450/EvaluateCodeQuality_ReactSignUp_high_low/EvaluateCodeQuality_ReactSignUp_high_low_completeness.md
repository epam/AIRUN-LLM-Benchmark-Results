# Evaluation Report

## Readability

### 1. Prop Types Deprecation
**Pass**: The `PropTypes` import from `react` is updated to import from the `prop-types` package.

### 2. Complex Validation Logic
**Pass**: The `asyncValidate` function is simplified and made more readable with async/await syntax.

## Maintainability

### 1. Tight Coupling
**Pass**: The `Signup` component is refactored to separate form logic from the component, improving reusability and testability.

## Performance
