# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that a loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass** - The code includes a loading state (`loading`) and conditionally renders a loading indicator (`<div>Loading...</div>`) when `loading` is `true`.

### Step 2: Verify that the loader does not hide the search input when data is loading.
**Pass** - The search input field is always rendered regardless of the loading state, ensuring it is not hidden when data is being fetched.

### Step 3: Validate that a request with an empty search term is sent on the initial render.
**Pass** - The `useEffect` hook calls `fetchCharacters()` without any arguments on the initial render, which sends a request with an empty search term.

### Step 4: Verify that the search input field is present.
**Pass** - The search input field is present in the JSX: `<input type="text" placeholder="Search characters" value={searchTerm} onChange={handleSearchChange} />`.

### Step 5: Ensure that the character search functionality is implemented.
**Pass** - The search functionality is implemented using the `handleSearchChange` function, which updates the `searchTerm` state and triggers the debounced search.

### Step 6: Ensure that the API request includes the search term as a query parameter.
**Pass** - The `fetchCharacters` function includes the search term as a query parameter in the API request: `params: { search }`.

### Step 7: Validate that the data is loading on initial app load with empty query and then when the search term changes.
**Pass** - The `useEffect` hook ensures data is loaded on initial app load, and the `debouncedSearch` function ensures data is loaded when the search term changes.

### Step 8: Ensure that the debounced fetch function prevents unnecessary API requests.
**Pass** - The `debouncedSearch` function, created using `lodash/debounce`, prevents unnecessary API requests by debouncing the search input.

### Step 9: Confirm that the character list is updated based on the search results.
**Pass** - The character list is updated based on the search results, as the `characters` state is updated with the API response and filtered by the `filteredCharacters` memoized value.

### Step 10: Validate that the application handles API request errors.
**Pass** - The `fetchCharacters` function includes a `try-catch` block to handle API request errors, logging the error and setting `characters` to an empty array.

### Step 11: Ensure that the user experience remains smooth without backend overloads.
**Pass** - The use of `lodash/debounce` ensures that the user experience remains smooth by limiting the frequency of API requests, preventing backend overloads.
