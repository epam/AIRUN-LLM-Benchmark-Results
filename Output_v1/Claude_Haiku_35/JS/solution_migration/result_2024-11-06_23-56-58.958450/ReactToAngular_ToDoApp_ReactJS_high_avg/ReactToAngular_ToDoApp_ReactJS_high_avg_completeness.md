# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that the main component displays the header with input for new todos.
**Pass**: The `app.component.html` contains a header with an input field for new todos.

### Step 2: Ensure that adding a new todo item works correctly.
**Pass**: The `addTodo` method in `app.component.ts` handles adding new todos, and the input field is bound to `newTodoText` using `ngModel`.

### Step 3: Verify that the todo list displays all added todo items.
**Pass**: The `app.component.html` uses `*ngFor` to iterate over `filteredTodos` and display each todo item using the `app-todo-item` component.

### Step 4: Confirm that toggle functionality works for marking todos as completed.
**Pass**: The `toggle` method in `app.component.ts` and the `toggle` method in `todo.model.ts` handle toggling the completed state of todos. The `app-todo-item` component emits the `toggle` event correctly.

### Step 5: Check that editing a todo item works and updates the todo item correctly.
**Pass**: The `edit` and `save` methods in `app.component.ts` handle editing and saving todos. The `app-todo-item` component emits the `edit` and `save` events correctly.

### Step 6: Ensure that deleting a todo item removes it from the list.
**Pass**: The `destroy` method in `app.component.ts` and the `destroy` method in `todo.model.ts` handle deleting todos. The `app-todo-item` component emits the `destroy` event correctly.

### Step 7: Verify that the footer correctly displays the count of active items.
**Pass**: The `app-todo-footer` component receives the `count` input, which is bound to `activeTodoCount` in `app.component.ts`.

### Step 8: Confirm that the footer's clear completed button works and removes completed items.
**Pass**: The `clearCompleted` method in `app.component.ts` and the `clearCompleted` method in `todo.model.ts` handle clearing completed todos. The `app-todo-footer` component emits the `clearCompleted` event correctly.

### Step 9: Check that filtering todos by "all", "active", and "completed" works correctly.
**Pass**: The `filteredTodos` getter in `app.component.ts` filters todos based on the `nowShowing` state, which is set based on the URL hash.

### Step 10: Ensure that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works correctly.
**Pass**: The `toggleAll` method in `app.component.ts` and the `toggleAll` method in `todo.model.ts` handle marking all todos as complete. The `app.component.html` contains the necessary input and label elements.

### Step 11: Check that the application persists todos to local storage and reloads them correctly.
**Pass**: The `TodoModel` service handles loading todos from local storage in its constructor and updates local storage whenever todos change.
