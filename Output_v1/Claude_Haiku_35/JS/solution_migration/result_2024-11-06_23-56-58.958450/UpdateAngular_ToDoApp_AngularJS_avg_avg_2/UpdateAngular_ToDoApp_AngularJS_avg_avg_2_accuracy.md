2. **Ensure the codebase is structured and follows Angular style guidelines and best practices.**
   - **Pass**: The codebase is well-structured, with clear separation of concerns and adherence to Angular style guidelines.

3. **Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of Angular and TypeScript.**
   - **Pass**: The code is written for Angular 14.x and uses TypeScript, ensuring compatibility with the latest versions.

4. **Verify the application works correctly across modern browsers.**
   - **Not Evaluated**: This step requires running the application in different browsers, which is not possible in this static evaluation.

5. **Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.**
   - **Not Evaluated**: This step requires running the application and checking the console, which is not possible in this static evaluation.

6. **Ensure the code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility.**
   - **Pass**: The code is decomposed into multiple components, each with a single responsibility.

7. **Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.**
   - **Pass**: The code does not contain any noticeable duplicates and follows DRY principles.

8. **Check that @ngrx/store is used for state management.**
   - **Pass**: The code uses @ngrx/store for state management.

9. **Check that @ngrx/effects is used for handling side effects.**
   - **Pass**: The code uses @ngrx/effects for handling side effects.

10. **Confirm that the code is split into separate components.**
    - **Pass**: The code is split into separate components such as `TodoListComponent` and `TodoItemComponent`.

11. **Ensure that localStorage is used for persisting todos via a service.**
    - **Fail**: The code uses localStorage directly in the effects instead of via a service.

12. **Check that state management actions and reducers are correctly implemented.**
    - **Pass**: State management actions and reducers are correctly implemented.

13. **Verify that effects are correctly implemented to handle side effects.**
    - **Pass**: Effects are correctly implemented to handle side effects.

14. **Ensure that the converted code does not contain any TODOs.**
    - **Pass**: The code does not contain any TODOs.

15. **Verify that all AngularJS-specific elements and syntax are removed.**
    - **Pass**: The code does not contain any AngularJS-specific elements or syntax.

16. **Confirm that the application structure adheres to Angular style guidelines.**
    - **Pass**: The application structure adheres to Angular style guidelines.

17. **Verify App does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.**
    - **Pass**: The application uses Angular's two-way data binding to retrieve the values of text fields.

18. **Verify App does not make API calls.**
    - **Pass**: The application does not make any API calls.

19. **Verify App has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.**
    - **Not Evaluated**: This step requires comparison with the original application's DOM tree structure, which is not provided.

20. **Verify that the code is migrated to Angular 14.x.**
    - **Pass**: The code is migrated to Angular 14.x.

### Summary

- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 20
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 16
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 1
- **Number of Not Evaluated Steps**: 3

Overall, the provided code is well-structured and follows Angular best practices, with the exception of using localStorage directly instead of via a service. Some steps could not be evaluated in this static review and would require running the application for a complete assessment.
