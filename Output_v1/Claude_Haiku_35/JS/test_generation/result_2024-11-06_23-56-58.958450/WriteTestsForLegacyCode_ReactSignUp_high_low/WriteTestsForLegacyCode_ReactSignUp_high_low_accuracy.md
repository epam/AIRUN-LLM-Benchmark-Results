# Evaluation Report

## Step 1: Check that the tests are isolated and do not depend on each other.
**Pass**: Each test case is independent and does not rely on the outcome of other tests. The `beforeEach` function ensures that mocks are cleared before each test.

## Step 2: Validate that the tests adhere to best practices for unit testing.
**Pass**: The tests follow best practices by being specific, isolated, and using mocks for external dependencies. They also cover various aspects of the component, including rendering, validation, and submission.

## Step 3: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
**Pass**: The code does not contain unnecessary duplicates and follows the DRY principle. Common setups and mocks are reused effectively.

## Step 4: Verify that the testing environment is set up correctly.
**Pass**: The `jest.config.js` file is correctly configured to set up the testing environment with `jsdom` and includes necessary setup files.

## Step 5: Check if a testing library for JavaScript (such as Jest) has been chosen.
**Pass**: Jest is chosen as the testing library, which is appropriate for this context.

## Step 6: Validate that dependencies are mocked where necessary, such as API calls.
**Pass**: API calls and other dependencies are mocked appropriately using Jest's mocking capabilities.

## Step 7: Verify that the test coverage for the code is at least 80%.
**Pass**: The `jest.config.js` file specifies a coverage threshold of 80% for branches, functions, lines, and statements, ensuring high test coverage.

## Step 8: Confirm that the package.json file includes necessary dependencies and scripts for running tests.
**Pass**: The `package.json` file includes necessary dependencies such as `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `@testing-library/react`, `babel-jest`, `jest`, and `jest-environment-jsdom`. It also includes scripts for running tests and generating coverage reports.

## Step 9: Confirm that the tests use the proper methods and assertions from the chosen testing library.
**Pass**: The tests use appropriate methods and assertions from Jest and React Testing Library, such as `render`, `screen`, `fireEvent`, `waitFor`, and `expect`.
