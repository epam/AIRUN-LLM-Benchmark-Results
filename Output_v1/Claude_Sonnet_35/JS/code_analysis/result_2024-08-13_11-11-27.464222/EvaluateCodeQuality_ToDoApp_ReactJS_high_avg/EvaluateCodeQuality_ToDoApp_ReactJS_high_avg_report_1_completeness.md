# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### 1. Ensure the use of `let` or `const` instead of `var`.
- **Pass**: The provided code examples use `const` and `let` instead of `var`.

### 2. Verify that `refs` are replaced with React's state and props for DOM manipulation.
- **Pass**: The code replaces `ReactDOM.findDOMNode` with `React.createRef`.

### 3. Confirm that variable and function names are descriptive and meaningful.
- **Pass**: Variable and function names are descriptive and meaningful, e.g., `handleChange`, `handleNewTodoKeyDown`.

### 4. Look for consistent use of whitespace and indentation.
- **Pass**: The code examples show consistent use of whitespace and indentation.

### 5. Ensure large methods are broken down into smaller, more manageable methods.
- **Pass**: The `render` method in `TodoApp` is broken down into `renderHeader`, `renderMain`, and `renderFooter`.

### 6. Verify that inline event handlers are moved to class methods.
- **Fail**: The example for fixing inconsistent use of arrow functions still uses inline event handlers for `onClick` and `onDoubleClick`.

### 7. Check for modular code structure with reusable components and functions.
- **Pass**: The code demonstrates modularity by breaking down the `TodoApp` component and using `React.memo` for `TodoItem`.

### 8. Confirm the use of TypeScript interfaces and types for better type safety.
- **Pass**: The code uses TypeScript interfaces and types, e.g., `IAppProps`, `IAppState`, `ITodoItemProps`.

### 9. Check for the elimination of inefficient DOM manipulation methods like `ReactDOM.findDOMNode`.
- **Pass**: The code eliminates the use of `ReactDOM.findDOMNode` and uses `React.createRef` instead.

### 10. Ensure that performance enhancements like `shouldComponentUpdate` are correctly implemented.
- **Pass**: The code suggests using `React.PureComponent` or `React.memo` for performance enhancements.

### 11. Verify that unnecessary re-renders are minimized by using appropriate React lifecycle methods.
- **Pass**: The use of `React.memo` helps minimize unnecessary re-renders.

### 12. Ensure the addition of ARIA attributes to improve accessibility.
- **Pass**: The code includes ARIA attributes, e.g., `aria-label="Mark all todos as complete"`.

### 13. Verify that all interactive elements have accessible names and roles.
- **Pass**: The code includes accessible names and roles for interactive elements.

### 14. Check for proper use of semantic HTML elements.
- **Pass**: The code uses semantic HTML elements, e.g., `<header>`, `<label>`.
