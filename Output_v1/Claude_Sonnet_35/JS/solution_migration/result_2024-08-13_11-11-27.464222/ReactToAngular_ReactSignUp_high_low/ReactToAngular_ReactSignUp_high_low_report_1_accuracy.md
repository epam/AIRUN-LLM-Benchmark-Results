### 2. Ensure the codebase is structured and follows Angular style guidelines and best practices.
**Pass**: The code is well-structured, follows Angular style guidelines, and uses best practices such as dependency injection, reactive forms, and observables.

### 3. Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of Angular and TypeScript.
**Pass**: The code uses Angular 14.x features and syntax, ensuring compatibility with the latest version of Angular and TypeScript.

### 4. Verify the application works correctly across modern browsers.
**Not Evaluated**: This step requires running the application in different browsers, which is not possible in this static evaluation.

### 5. Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.
**Not Evaluated**: This step requires running the application and checking the console for errors and warnings, which is not possible in this static evaluation.

### 6. Ensure the code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility.
**Pass**: The code is decomposed into multiple components (`SignupComponent` and `FormGroupComponent`), each with a single responsibility.

### 7. Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
**Pass**: The code does not contain any duplicates and follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

### 8. Ensure the application handles API errors.
**Pass**: The `onSubmit` method in `SignupComponent` includes error handling for API calls.

### 9. Validate that @ngrx/store is used for state management and that the state is properly defined in auth.reducer.ts and app.state.ts.
**Not Evaluated**: The provided code uses `@ngrx/store` for state management, but the state definitions in `auth.reducer.ts` and `app.state.ts` are not provided for evaluation.

### 10. Verify the UI and UX by running the Angular application and ensuring that the signup form behaves as expected, including form validation and error messages.
**Not Evaluated**: This step requires running the application and manually verifying the UI and UX, which is not possible in this static evaluation.

### 11. Confirm that the signup action is correctly dispatched from the SignupComponent upon form submission.
**Pass**: The `onSubmit` method in `SignupComponent` correctly dispatches the `signupComplete` action upon successful form submission.

### 12. Verify app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of Angular’s framework.
**Pass**: The code does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of Angular’s framework.

### 13. Verify app does not overuse Angular references for DOM access instead of Angular’s state and props.
**Pass**: The code uses Angular's state and props appropriately and does not overuse Angular references for DOM access.

### 14. Check that there are no TODOs or incomplete parts in the code.
**Pass**: There are no TODOs or incomplete parts in the provided code.
