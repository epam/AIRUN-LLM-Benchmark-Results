2. **Pass**: Ensure the codebase is structured and follows React best practices (state, hooks, effects).
   - The codebase is well-structured and follows React best practices.

3. **Pass**: Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.
   - The code does not show any signs of memory leaks or unnecessary re-renders.

4. **Pass**: Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.

    - The app does not use timers, subscriptions, or event listeners that require cleanup.

15. **Pass**: App has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.
    - The DOM tree structure and classes are consistent with the original application.

16. **Pass**: Ensure that the code is split into separate components.

23. **Pass**: Confirm that the store configuration file uses Redux Toolkit.
    - The store configuration file uses Redux Toolkit.

24. **Pass**: Verify that the application uses `createSlice` from Redux Toolkit to define actions and reducers for adding, toggling one and all, editing, deleting, clearing completed, and filtering TODO items.
    - The application uses `createSlice` from Redux Toolkit for defining actions and reducers.

25. **Pass**: Confirm the use of `nanoid` for generating unique IDs.
