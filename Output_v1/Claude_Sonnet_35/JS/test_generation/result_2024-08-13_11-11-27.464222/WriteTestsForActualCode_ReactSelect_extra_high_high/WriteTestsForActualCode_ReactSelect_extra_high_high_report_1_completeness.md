### Step 10: Verify that all tests are written using React Testing Library's render, screen, and fireEvent methods.
**Pass**: All tests use `render`, `screen`, and `fireEvent` methods from React Testing Library.

### Step 11: Ensure that all tests use the expect function from Jest to assert outcomes.
**Pass**: All tests use the `expect` function from Jest.

### Step 12: Verify that the test for rendering the component checks for the presence of the placeholder text.
**Pass**: The test `renders without crashing` checks for the placeholder text 'Select...'.
