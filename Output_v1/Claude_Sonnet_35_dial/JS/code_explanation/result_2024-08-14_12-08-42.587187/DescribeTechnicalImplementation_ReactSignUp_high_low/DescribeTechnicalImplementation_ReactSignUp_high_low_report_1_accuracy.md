# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Check that the documentation maintains consistent formatting, terminology, and style throughout.
- **Pass**: The documentation maintains a consistent format, using headings, bullet points, and tables uniformly. Terminology and style are consistent across both components.

### Step 2: Ensure the language is clear, professional, and free of ambiguous statements.
- **Pass**: The language used in the documentation is clear, professional, and free of ambiguous statements. Each section is well-defined and easy to understand.

### Step 3: Verify that all code snippets provided in the usage examples are accurate and functional based on the original code.
- **Pass**: The code snippets provided in the usage examples are accurate and functional. They correctly demonstrate how to use the `Signup` and `FormGroup` components.

### Step 4: Ensure that the prop types listed in the documentation match those defined in the original code's PropTypes.
- **Fail**: The documentation does not explicitly mention the PropTypes used in the original code. While the prop types listed in the documentation seem reasonable, without the original code, it's impossible to verify their accuracy.
