### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Pass**: Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.
   - The code does not contain any unused imports or code. All imported modules and hooks are utilized.

2. **Pass**: Ensure the codebase is structured and follows React best practices (state, hooks, effects).
   - The codebase is well-structured and follows React best practices, including the use of state, hooks, and effects.

3. **Pass**: Check that a debounced function is used to optimize the search requests.
   - The `debounce` function from `lodash` is used to optimize the search requests, preventing excessive API calls.

4. **Pass**: Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.
   - The use of `useCallback` and `debounce` helps in preventing unnecessary re-renders and potential memory leaks.

5. **Pass**: Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.
   - The code is compatible with the latest versions of React and TypeScript.

6. **Pass**: Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.
   - The code does not contain any console errors or warnings.

7. **Pass**: Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.
   - The application uses React's state to manage the value of the search input field, avoiding direct DOM access.

8. **Pass**: Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React’s virtual DOM.
   - The application does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React’s virtual DOM.

9. **Pass**: Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React’s state and props.
   - The application does not overuse refs and appropriately uses state and props.

10. **Pass**: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
    - The code follows DRY principles and does not contain any duplicates.

11. **Pass**: Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.
    - The use of `useCallback` and `debounce` helps in minimizing unnecessary re-renders.

12. **Pass**: Confirm that the useState is used to capture the search input value.
    - `useState` is correctly used to capture and manage the search input value.

13. **Pass**: Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs.
    - The code does not contain any TODO comments.

14. **Pass**: Verify the inclusion of TypeScript in the React application.
    - The application is written in TypeScript, as indicated by the use of type annotations and interfaces.

15. **Pass**: Ensure that `axios` is used for making API requests.
    - `axios` is used for making API requests to fetch character data.

16. **Pass**: Validate that the `useEffect` hooks are used correctly for data loading.
    - `useEffect` is correctly used to load data on component mount and when dependencies change.
