# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Check that a loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.**
   - **Pass**: The code includes a loading state (`loading`) and conditionally renders a "Loading..." message when `loading` is `true`.

2. **Verify that the loader does not hide the search input when data is loading.**
   - **Pass**: The search input is always rendered regardless of the loading state.

3. **Validate that a request with an empty search term is sent on the initial render.**
   - **Pass**: The `useEffect` hook calls `fetchCharacters('')` on initial render, ensuring an empty search term request.

4. **Verify that the search input field is present.**
   - **Pass**: The search input field is present in the JSX with the placeholder "Search characters...".

5. **Ensure that the character search functionality is implemented.**
   - **Pass**: The `handleSearchChange` function updates the `searchTerm` state and calls the debounced fetch function.

6. **Ensure that the API request includes the search term as a query parameter.**
   - **Pass**: The `fetchCharacters` function includes the search term in the API request parameters.

7. **Validate that the data is loading on initial app load with empty query and then when the search term changes.**
   - **Pass**: The initial data load is triggered by `useEffect`, and subsequent loads are triggered by changes in the search term.

8. **Ensure that the debounced fetch function prevents unnecessary API requests.**
   - **Pass**: The `debouncedFetchCharacters` function uses lodash's `debounce` to limit the frequency of API requests.

9. **Confirm that the character list is updated based on the search results.**
   - **Pass**: The character list is updated by setting the `characters` state with the API response data.

10. **Validate that the application handles API request errors.**
    - **Pass**: The `fetchCharacters` function includes a try-catch block to handle and log errors.

11. **Ensure that the user experience remains smooth without backend overloads.**
    - **Pass**: The use of debouncing ensures that the backend is not overloaded with excessive requests.
