# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps:

1. **Confirm that constraints related to local storage limitations are noted.**
   - **Pass**: The answer mentions that "Local storage may limit the number of todos that can be stored efficiently."

2. **Verify that assumptions about the application being designed for a single user are mentioned.**
   - **Pass**: The answer states, "Single-user application (no multi-user support or synchronization)."

3. **Ensure that browser compatibility assumptions are included.**
   - **Pass**: The answer includes, "Assumes modern browser support for React and ES6+ features."

4. **Check that performance-related constraints are noted.**
   - **Pass**: The answer mentions, "No pagination or lazy loading implemented, which may impact performance with a large number of todos."

5. **Confirm that performance optimizations, such as the use of `shouldComponentUpdate`, are identified.**
   - **Pass**: The answer states, "Implements shouldComponentUpdate in TodoItem for performance optimization."

6. **Verify that considerations for using immutable data structures for performance are mentioned.**
   - **Pass**: The answer notes, "Uses immutable data structures (map, filter, reduce) for better performance and easier state management."

7. **Ensure scalability considerations related to local storage limitations are discussed.**
   - **Pass**: The answer mentions, "Local storage may limit the number of todos that can be stored efficiently."

8. **Check that the potential need for a backend service for better scalability is mentioned.**
   - **Fail**: The answer does not mention the potential need for a backend service for better scalability.

9. **Confirm that the evaluation steps are unambiguous and concise.**
   - **Pass**: The evaluation steps are clear and concise.

10. **Ensure that each step allows the evaluator to assess the output based solely on the provided code.**
    - **Pass**: Each step is designed to assess the output based on the provided code analysis.

11. **Verify that the steps are clearly articulated and cover all main points of the task.**
    - **Pass**: The steps are clearly articulated and cover the main points of the task.

### Summary:
- **Total number of steps evaluated**: 11
- **Number of passed steps**: 10
- **Number of failed steps**: 1

Overall, the answer provided a comprehensive analysis of the business requirements addressed by the code, with only one step failing due to the omission of the potential need for a backend service for better scalability.
