# Evaluation Report

## Readability
### 1. Complex Promise Chain in savePage()
- **Pass**: The original code uses nested callbacks which are hard to follow. The refactored version using async/await improves readability significantly.

## Maintainability
### 1. Global State Management
- **Pass**: The original code uses factory services for global state, which can be hard to track. The refactored version using a store pattern is a better approach for state management.

## Performance
### 1. Unnecessary Watchers
- **Pass**: The original code creates watchers for all page properties, which can impact performance. The refactored version only watches specific properties that need updates, improving performance.

## Accessibility
### 1. Missing ARIA Labels
- **Pass**: The original code lacks proper ARIA labels and roles. The refactored version includes ARIA labels and roles, improving accessibility.

## Best Practices
### 1. Missing Type Safety
- **Pass**: The original code doesn't use TypeScript, which could prevent runtime errors. The refactored version using TypeScript improves type safety.

## Testing
### 1. Hard to Test Components
- **Pass**: The original code tightly couples components, making them hard to test. The refactored version provides a better test structure.

## Documentation
### 1. Insufficient JSDoc Comments
- **Pass**: The original code lacks proper documentation for methods and parameters. The refactored version includes JSDoc comments, improving documentation.
