# Evaluation Report

## Step 1: Ensure the use of `let` or `const` instead of `var`.
**Pass**: The provided code uses `const` instead of `var`.

## Step 2: Verify that `refs` are replaced with React state and props for DOM manipulation.
**Pass**: The code replaces `ReactDOM.findDOMNode` with `React.createRef` and uses `forwardRef`.

## Step 3: Confirm that variable and function names are descriptive and meaningful.
**Pass**: Variable and function names such as `handleNewTodoKeyDown`, `TodoMain`, and `inputRef` are descriptive and meaningful.

## Step 4: Look for consistent use of whitespace and indentation.
**Pass**: The code maintains consistent use of whitespace and indentation.

## Step 5: Ensure large methods are broken down into smaller, more manageable methods.
**Pass**: The `render` method in `TodoApp` is broken down into smaller components like `TodoMain`.

## Step 6: Verify that inline event handlers are moved to class methods.
**Pass**: Inline event handlers are moved to class methods, such as `handleNewTodoKeyDown`.

## Step 7: Check for modular code structure with reusable components and functions.
**Pass**: The code demonstrates a modular structure with reusable components like `TodoMain` and `NewTodoInput`.

## Step 8: Confirm the use of TypeScript interfaces and types for better type safety.
**Pass**: The code includes TypeScript interfaces for props and state, such as `ITodo` and `ITodoItemProps`.

## Step 9: Check for the elimination of inefficient DOM manipulation methods like `ReactDOM.findDOMNode`.
**Pass**: The code eliminates the use of `ReactDOM.findDOMNode` and replaces it with `React.createRef`.

## Step 10: Ensure that performance enhancements like `shouldComponentUpdate` are correctly implemented.
**Fail**: The provided code does not include any implementation of `shouldComponentUpdate` or similar performance enhancements.

## Step 11: Verify that unnecessary re-renders are minimized by using appropriate React lifecycle methods.
**Fail**: The provided code does not explicitly address minimizing unnecessary re-renders using React lifecycle methods.

## Step 12: Ensure the addition of ARIA attributes to improve accessibility.
**Pass**: The code includes ARIA attributes for better screen reader support.

## Step 13: Verify that all interactive elements have accessible names and roles.
**Pass**: Interactive elements like checkboxes have accessible names and roles.

## Step 14: Check for proper use of semantic HTML elements.
