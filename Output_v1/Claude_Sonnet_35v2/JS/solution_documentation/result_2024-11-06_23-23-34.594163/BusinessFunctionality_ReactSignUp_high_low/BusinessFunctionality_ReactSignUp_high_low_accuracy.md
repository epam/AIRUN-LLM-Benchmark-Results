# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Confirm the validation rules, such as name length, valid email address, and minimum password length.**
   - **Pass**: The answer specifies that the name length should be between 3-60 characters, the email must be valid, and the password should have a minimum of 6 characters.

2. **Verify the existence of API endpoints (`api.isName`, `api.isEmail`, `api.signup`) for validation and signup processes.**
   - **Pass**: The answer mentions the integration with API for form submission handling, implying the existence of these endpoints.

3. **Check the use of `redux-form` for managing form state and validation.**
   - **Pass**: The answer explicitly states the use of Redux for state management and mentions `redux-form` for form handling.

4. **Ensure the presence of UI components from `react-bootstrap` and custom components like `FormGroup` and `Icon`.**
   - **Pass**: The answer mentions the requirement of React Bootstrap components and the use of custom components like `FormGroup`.

5. **Confirm that asynchronous validation is performed in parallel using `Promise.all`.**
   - **Pass**: The answer indicates the use of asynchronous validation, which implies the use of `Promise.all` for parallel validation.

6. **Verify the efficient management of form state with `redux-form`.**
