# Evaluation Report

## Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
**Pass**: The `Header` component contains an input field with the class `new-todo`. The `handleNewTodoKeyDown` function handles the Enter key press, trims the input value, and dispatches the `addTodo` action with the input value.

## Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
**Pass**: The `TodoList` component filters the todos based on the current filter state (`all`, `active`, `completed`) and maps the filtered todos to the `TodoItem` component.

## Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
**Pass**: The `TodoList` component includes a checkbox with the id `toggle-all` that dispatches the `toggleAll` action when changed, toggling the completion status of all todos.

## Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
**Pass**: The `TodoItem` component includes functionality to toggle (`toggleTodo`), edit (`editTodo`), and delete (`deleteTodo`) each todo item.

## Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
**Pass**: The `TodoItem` component starts editing on double-click (`onDoubleClick`), submits the edited todo on Enter key press (`handleKeyDown`), and resets the editing state on Esc key press.

## Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
**Pass**: The `TodoFooter` component displays the count of active items, includes filter links (`all`, `active`, `completed`), and has a button to clear completed items (`clearCompleted`).

## Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
**Pass**: The `TodoFooter` component includes a button with the class `clear-completed` that dispatches the `clearCompleted` action when clicked.
