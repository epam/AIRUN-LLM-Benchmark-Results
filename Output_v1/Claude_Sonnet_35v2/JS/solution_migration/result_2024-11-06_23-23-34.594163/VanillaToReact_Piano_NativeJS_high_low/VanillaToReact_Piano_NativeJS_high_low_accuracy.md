# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.
- **Pass**: All imports in the provided code are used and necessary for the functionality of the application.

### Step 2: Ensure the codebase is structured and follows React best practices (state, hooks, effects).
- **Pass**: The codebase is well-structured, using functional components, hooks for state management (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`), and effects for side effects.

### Step 3: Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.

### Step 4: Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.
- **Pass**: The code uses modern React and TypeScript features, indicating compatibility with the latest versions.

### Step 5: Verify the application works correctly across modern browsers.
- **Pass**: The code does not contain any browser-specific code that would limit its compatibility with modern browsers.

### Step 6: Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.
- **Pass**: There are no obvious issues in the code that would cause console errors or warnings.

### Step 7: Verify that the new React app initializes successfully without errors.
