# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that the tests are isolated and do not depend on each other.
**Pass**: Each test case is independent and does not rely on the state or outcome of other tests. The `beforeEach` function ensures that mocks are cleared before each test.

### Step 2: Validate that the tests adhere to best practices for unit testing.
**Pass**: The tests follow best practices by being specific, isolated, and using descriptive names. They also use `jest.fn()` for mocking functions and `beforeEach` to reset mocks.

### Step 3: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
**Pass**: The code adheres to the DRY principle by defining `defaultProps` and reusing it across multiple tests. There are no unnecessary duplicates.

### Step 4: Ensure that the test suite achieves at least 80% code coverage for the Select component.
**Fail**: The provided code does not include a code coverage report. Without this report, it is not possible to confirm if the test suite achieves at least 80% code coverage.

### Step 5: Confirm that there are no TODO comments in the generated test code.
**Pass**: There are no TODO comments in the test code.

### Step 6: Check that mocking is used for dependencies where necessary using jest.fn().
**Pass**: Mocking is appropriately used with `jest.fn()` for functions like `onChange`, `onInputChange`, `onMenuOpen`, and `onMenuClose`.

### Step 7: Verify that the testing environment setup code is included.
**Pass**: The testing environment setup code is included with the necessary imports and `beforeEach` setup.

### Step 8: Confirm that the testing environment setup code uses Jest and React Testing Library.
**Pass**: The setup code uses Jest for mocking and assertions, and React Testing Library for rendering components and interacting with the DOM.

### Step 9: Ensure that the test file imports necessary modules such as React, Jest, React Testing Library, and the Select component.
**Pass**: The test file imports React, Jest, React Testing Library, and the Select component.

### Step 10: Verify that default props for the Select component are defined in the test file.
**Pass**: Default props for the Select component are defined in the test file.

### Step 11: Check that the default props include all necessary properties for the Select component.
**Pass**: The default props include all necessary properties such as `options`, `onChange`, `onInputChange`, `onMenuOpen`, `onMenuClose`, `inputValue`, and `isMulti`.

### Step 12: Verify that the testing libraries are chosen appropriately.
**Pass**: The testing libraries, Jest and React Testing Library, are appropriate choices for testing React components.

### Step 13: Ensure the testing environment is set up correctly.
**Pass**: The testing environment is set up correctly with the necessary imports and setup code.
