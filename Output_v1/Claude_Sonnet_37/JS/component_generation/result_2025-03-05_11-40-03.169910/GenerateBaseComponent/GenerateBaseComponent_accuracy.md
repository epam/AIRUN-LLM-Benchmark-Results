# Evaluation Report

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Pass**: Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.
   - All imports are used within the component.

2. **Pass**: Ensure the codebase is structured and follows TypeScript and React best practices (state, hooks, effects).
   - The code is well-structured and follows best practices for using state, hooks, and effects.

3. **Pass**: Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.
   - The use of `useEffect` for event listeners and cleanup ensures there are no memory leaks. State updates are managed efficiently to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

4. **Pass**: Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.
   - The code uses React hooks and TypeScript, which are compatible with the latest versions.

5. **Pass**: Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.
   - The code does not contain any obvious issues that would cause console errors or warnings.

6. **Pass**: Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.
   - The code uses React state to manage the values of text fields.

7. **Pass**: Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React virtual DOM.
   - The code does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React's virtual DOM.

8. **Pass**: Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React state and props.
   - Refs are used appropriately for focus management and scrolling, not for state management.

9. **Pass**: Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.
   - State updates are managed efficiently to avoid excessive re-renders.

10. **Pass**: Ensure the code adheres to accessibility standards (e.g., ARIA roles).
    - The component includes ARIA roles and attributes to enhance accessibility.

11. **Pass**: Ensure the component is written in TypeScript.
    - The component is written in TypeScript.

12. **Pass**: Verify the component is created using React 18.x.
    - The code is compatible with React 18.x.

13. **Pass**: Verify the presence of an index.css file.
    - The `index.css` file is present and used for styling.

14. **Pass**: Check that the generated code does not contain any TODOs.
    - The code does not contain any TODO comments.

15. **Pass**: App does correctly use useEffect, avoiding infinite loops.
    - The `useEffect` hooks are used correctly, with appropriate dependencies to avoid infinite loops.
