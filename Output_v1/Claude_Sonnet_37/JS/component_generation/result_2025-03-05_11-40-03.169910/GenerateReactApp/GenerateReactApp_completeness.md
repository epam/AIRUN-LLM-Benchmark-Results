# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Ensure that the API call to https://swapi.dev/api/people is made using axios.
- **Pass**: The API call is made using axios in `src/api.ts` with the function `fetchCharacters`.

### Step 2: Make sure the data is fetched initially without any input fields.
- **Pass**: The data is fetched on component mount using the `useEffect` hook in `src/App.tsx`.

### Step 3: Ensure a loader or loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
- **Pass**: A loader component (`Loader.tsx`) is displayed while data is being fetched, as indicated by the `loading` state in `src/App.tsx`.

### Step 4: Verify that errors are logged to the console if the API call fails.
- **Fail**: Errors are not logged to the console. Instead, an error message is displayed in the UI (`<div className="error-message">{error}</div>`).

### Step 5: Ensure that the fetched characters are displayed in a list format.
- **Pass**: The fetched characters are displayed in a list format using the `CharacterList` component in `src/components/CharacterList.tsx`.

### Step 6: Make sure each list item has a unique key derived from the character URL.
- **Fail**: The key for each list item is derived from the index (`key={index}`) instead of the character URL.

## Summary
- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 6
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 4
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 2

Overall, the implementation is mostly correct but needs adjustments for error logging and unique key assignment for list items.
