# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that a loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass** - The code includes a loading state (`loading`) and conditionally renders a loading indicator (`<div className="loader">Loading...</div>`) when `loading` is `true`.

### Step 2: Verify that the loader does not hide the search input when data is loading.
**Pass** - The search input is rendered outside the conditional block that displays the loader, ensuring it remains visible regardless of the loading state.

### Step 3: Validate that a request with an empty search term is sent on the initial render.
**Pass** - The `useEffect` hook calls `fetchCharacters('')` on initial render, ensuring an empty search term request is sent.

### Step 4: Verify that the search input field is present.
**Pass** - The search input field is present in the JSX: 
```tsx
<input
    type="text"
    placeholder="Search characters..."
    value={searchTerm}
    onChange={handleSearchChange}
    className="search-input"
/>
```

### Step 5: Ensure that the character search functionality is implemented.
**Pass** - The search functionality is implemented using the `handleSearchChange` function, which updates the `searchTerm` state and triggers the debounced search.

### Step 6: Ensure that the API request includes the search term as a query parameter.
**Pass** - The `fetchCharacters` function includes the search term as a query parameter:
```tsx
const response = await axios.get<SWAPIResponse>(`https://swapi.dev/api/people`, {
    params: query ? { search: query } : {}
});
```

### Step 7: Validate that the data is loading on initial app load with empty query and then when the search term changes.
**Pass** - The `useEffect` hook ensures data is loaded on initial app load, and the `debouncedSearch` function ensures data is loaded when the search term changes.

### Step 8: Ensure that the debounced fetch function prevents unnecessary API requests.
**Pass** - The `debouncedSearch` function uses `debounce` from `lodash` to prevent unnecessary API requests:
```tsx
const debouncedSearch = useCallback(
    debounce((query: string) => {
        fetchCharacters(query);
    }, 500),
    [fetchCharacters]
);
```

### Step 9: Confirm that the character list is updated based on the search results.
**Pass** - The character list is updated based on the `characters` state, which is set by the `fetchCharacters` function.

### Step 10: Validate that the application handles API request errors.
**Pass** - The `fetchCharacters` function includes a `try-catch` block to handle API request errors:
```tsx
try {
    const response = await axios.get<SWAPIResponse>(`https://swapi.dev/api/people`, {
        params: query ? { search: query } : {}
    });
    setCharacters(response.data.results);
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch characters:', error);
} finally {
    setLoading(false);
}
```

### Step 11: Ensure that the user experience remains smooth without backend overloads.
**Pass** - The use of `debounce` ensures that the backend is not overloaded with excessive API requests, maintaining a smooth user experience.
