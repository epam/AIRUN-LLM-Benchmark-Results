# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Confirm that the state slices for page and user are correctly defined and managed.
- **Pass**: The state slices for `page` and `user` are correctly defined using `createSlice` from `@reduxjs/toolkit`. The initial states are properly set, and reducers are defined to handle state updates.

### Step 2: Verify that API service functions are correctly defined and used.
- **Pass**: The API service functions are correctly defined using `axios` and are used appropriately in the Redux slices and components. The functions cover all necessary CRUD operations and additional functionalities like tag and extra management.

### Step 3: Ensure that the application correctly handles all the functionalities from the original Angular code.
- **Pass**: The application handles all functionalities from the original Angular code, including fetching, saving, updating, and deleting pages, managing tags, and handling extras and revisions.

### Step 4: Verify that all functionalities like save, delete, update, and tag management are working correctly.
- **Pass**: The functionalities for saving, deleting, updating, and managing tags are implemented correctly. The `pageSlice` includes async thunks for these operations, and the `PageEditor` component uses these thunks to perform the necessary actions.

### Step 5: Ensure that the application performs all CRUD operations correctly.
- **Pass**: The application performs all CRUD operations correctly. The `contentAPI` object defines methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting content, revisions, extras, and tags. These methods are used in the Redux slices to manage the state.

### Step 6: Verify that the application handles local storage and state persistence correctly.
- **Pass**: The application handles local storage and state persistence correctly. The `pageSlice` includes actions for saving, loading, and deleting local versions of the page. The `PageEditor` component uses these actions to manage local storage.
