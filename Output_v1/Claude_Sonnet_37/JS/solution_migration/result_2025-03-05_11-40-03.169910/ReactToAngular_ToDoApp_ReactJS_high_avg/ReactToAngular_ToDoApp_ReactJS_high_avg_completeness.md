# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that the main component displays the header with input for new todos.
- **Pass**: The `app.component.html` contains a header with an input field for new todos.

### Step 2: Ensure that adding a new todo item works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `handleNewTodoKeyDown` method in `app.component.ts` handles adding new todos when the Enter key is pressed.

### Step 3: Verify that the todo list displays all added todo items.
- **Pass**: The `app.component.html` uses `*ngFor` to iterate over todos and display them using the `app-todo-item` component.

### Step 4: Confirm that toggle functionality works for marking todos as completed.
- **Pass**: The `toggle` method in `app.component.ts` dispatches the `toggleTodo` action, and the `todo-item.component.html` handles the toggle event.

### Step 5: Check that editing a todo item works and updates the todo item correctly.
- **Pass**: The `edit` and `save` methods in `app.component.ts` handle editing and saving todos, and the `todo-item.component.html` supports editing functionality.

### Step 6: Ensure that deleting a todo item removes it from the list.
- **Pass**: The `destroy` method in `app.component.ts` dispatches the `destroyTodo` action, and the `todo-item.component.html` handles the destroy event.

### Step 7: Verify that the footer correctly displays the count of active items.
- **Pass**: The `app-todo-footer` component in `app.component.html` displays the count of active items using the `activeTodoCount$` observable.

### Step 8: Confirm that the footer's clear completed button works and removes completed items.
- **Pass**: The `clearCompleted` method in `app.component.ts` dispatches the `clearCompleted` action, and the `app-todo-footer` component handles the clear completed event.

### Step 9: Check that filtering todos by "all", "active", and "completed" works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `filterTodos` method in `app.component.ts` filters todos based on the `nowShowing` state, and the `app.component.html` uses this method to display filtered todos.

### Step 10: Ensure that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `toggleAll` method in `app.component.ts` dispatches the `toggleAll` action, and the `app.component.html` handles the toggle all event.

### Step 11: Check that the application persists todos to local storage and reloads them correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoEffects` class in `todo.effects.ts` handles loading and saving todos to local storage using the `UtilsService`.
