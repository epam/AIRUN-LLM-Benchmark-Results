## Steps

### Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
- **Pass**: The `Header` component contains an input field with the class `new-todo`. The `handleNewTodoKeyDown` function handles the Enter key press, trims the input value, and dispatches the `addTodo` action if the value is not empty.

### Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
- **Pass**: The `TodoList` component filters the todos based on the `nowShowing` prop and maps the filtered todos to `TodoItem` components.

### Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
- **Pass**: The `TodoList` component includes a checkbox with the id `toggle-all` that dispatches the `toggleAll` action when changed.

### Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItem` component includes:
  - A checkbox to toggle the completion status, dispatching the `toggleTodo` action.
  - A label that starts editing on double-click.
  - A button to delete the todo, dispatching the `deleteTodo` action.

### Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItem` component:
  - Starts editing on double-clicking the label.
  - Submits the edited todo on Enter key press, dispatching the `updateTodo` action.
  - Resets the edit text on Esc key press.

### Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFooter` component:
  - Displays the count of active items.
  - Provides filter links to change the `nowShowing` state.
  - Includes a button to clear completed items, dispatching the `clearCompleted` action.

### Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFooter` component includes a button with the class `clear-completed` that dispatches the `clearCompleted` action when clicked.
