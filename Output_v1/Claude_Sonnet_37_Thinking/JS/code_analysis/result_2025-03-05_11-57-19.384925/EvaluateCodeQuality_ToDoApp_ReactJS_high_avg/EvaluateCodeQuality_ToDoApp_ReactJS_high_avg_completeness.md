# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Ensure the use of `let` or `const` instead of `var`.
- **Pass**: The provided code examples use `const` and `let` instead of `var`.

### Step 2: Verify that `refs` are replaced with React state and props for DOM manipulation.
- **Pass**: The code replaces string refs and `ReactDOM.findDOMNode` with `React.createRef()`.

### Step 3: Confirm that variable and function names are descriptive and meaningful.
- **Pass**: Variable and function names are descriptive and meaningful, such as `handleNewTodoKeyDown`, `editFieldRef`, and `getVisibleTodos`.

### Step 4: Look for consistent use of whitespace and indentation.
- **Pass**: The code examples show consistent use of whitespace and indentation.

### Step 5: Ensure large methods are broken down into smaller, more manageable methods.
- **Pass**: The code refactors large methods into smaller, more manageable methods, such as `handleSubmit`, `handleEdit`, and `handleKeyDown`.

### Step 6: Verify that inline event handlers are moved to class methods.
- **Pass**: Inline event handlers are moved to class methods, as seen in the `handleNewTodoKeyDown` method.

### Step 7: Check for modular code structure with reusable components and functions.
- **Pass**: The code demonstrates a modular structure with reusable components like `TodoItem` and `TodoApp`.

### Step 8: Confirm the use of TypeScript interfaces and types for better type safety.
- **Pass**: The code includes TypeScript interfaces and types, such as `ITodo`, `IAppProps`, and `ITodoModel`.

### Step 9: Check for the elimination of inefficient DOM manipulation methods like `ReactDOM.findDOMNode`.
- **Pass**: Inefficient DOM manipulation methods like `ReactDOM.findDOMNode` are eliminated and replaced with `React.createRef()`.

### Step 10: Ensure that performance enhancements like `shouldComponentUpdate` are correctly implemented.
- **Fail**: The code does not explicitly mention the implementation of `shouldComponentUpdate` or similar performance enhancements.

### Step 11: Verify that unnecessary re-renders are minimized by using appropriate React lifecycle methods.
- **Pass**: The code uses `React.memo` to minimize unnecessary re-renders.

### Step 12: Ensure the addition of ARIA attributes to improve accessibility.
- **Pass**: The code includes ARIA attributes for better accessibility, such as `aria-label` and `role`.

### Step 13: Verify that all interactive elements have accessible names and roles.
- **Pass**: Interactive elements have accessible names and roles, such as the `aria-label` for the delete button.

### Step 14: Check for proper use of semantic HTML elements.
- **Pass**: The code uses semantic HTML elements, such as `<section>`, `<ul>`, and `<button>`.
