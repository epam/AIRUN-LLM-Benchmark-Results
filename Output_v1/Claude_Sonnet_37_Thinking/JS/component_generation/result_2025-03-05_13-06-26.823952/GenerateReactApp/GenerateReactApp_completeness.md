### Recommendations
- **Step 4**: To pass this step, add a `console.error` statement in the catch block of the `loadCharacters` function in `src/App.tsx` to log errors to the console.

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const loadCharacters = async () => {
    try {
      const data = await fetchCharacters();
      setCharacters(data.results);
      setLoading(false);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to load characters', error); // Add this line
      setError('Failed to load characters');
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };

  loadCharacters();
}, []);
```
