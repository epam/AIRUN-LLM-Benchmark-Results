# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Check that the main component displays the header with input for new todos.
- **Pass**: The `app.component.html` contains a header with an input field for new todos.

### Step 2: Ensure that adding a new todo item works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `handleNewTodoKeyDown` method in `app.component.ts` handles adding new todos, and the `TodoService` dispatches the `addTodo` action.

### Step 3: Verify that the todo list displays all added todo items.
- **Pass**: The `app.component.html` uses `*ngFor` to iterate over `visibleTodos$` and displays each todo item using the `app-todo-item` component.

### Step 4: Confirm that toggle functionality works for marking todos as completed.
- **Pass**: The `toggle` method in `app.component.ts` calls the `toggle` method in `TodoService`, which dispatches the `toggleTodo` action.

### Step 5: Check that editing a todo item works and updates the todo item correctly.
- **Pass**: The `handleEdit` and `handleSubmit` methods in `todo-item.component.ts` handle editing and saving a todo item, and the `TodoService` dispatches the `editTodo` and `saveTodo` actions.

### Step 6: Ensure that deleting a todo item removes it from the list.
- **Pass**: The `destroy` method in `app.component.ts` calls the `destroy` method in `TodoService`, which dispatches the `destroyTodo` action.

### Step 7: Verify that the footer correctly displays the count of active items.
- **Pass**: The `todo-footer.component.ts` uses the `count` input to display the number of active items, and the `app.component.html` binds `activeTodoCount$` to this input.

### Step 8: Confirm that the footer's clear completed button works and removes completed items.
- **Pass**: The `clearCompleted` method in `app.component.ts` calls the `clearCompleted` method in `TodoService`, which dispatches the `clearCompleted` action.

### Step 9: Check that filtering todos by "all", "active", and "completed" works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `updateRouting` method in `app.component.ts` updates the filter based on the route, and the `changeFilter` method in `TodoService` dispatches the `changeFilter` action.

### Step 10: Ensure that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `toggleAll` method in `app.component.ts` calls the `toggleAll` method in `TodoService`, which dispatches the `toggleAll` action.

### Step 11: Check that the application persists todos to local storage and reloads them correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoEffects` class handles loading and saving todos to local storage using the `Utils.store` method.
