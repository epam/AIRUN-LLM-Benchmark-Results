# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps:

1. **Check that the tests are isolated and do not depend on each other.**
   - **Pass**: Each test case is independent and uses `beforeEach` to clear mocks, ensuring no dependencies between tests.

2. **Validate that the tests adhere to best practices for unit testing.**
   - **Pass**: The tests are well-structured, use descriptive names, and cover various aspects of the component's behavior.

3. **Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.**
   - **Pass**: The code avoids duplication by using helper functions and default props.

4. **Ensure that the test suite achieves at least 80% code coverage for the Select component.**
   - **Pass**: The test suite covers a wide range of scenarios, including rendering, interaction, keyboard events, and custom behavior, likely achieving high code coverage.

5. **Confirm that there are no TODO comments in the generated test code.**
   - **Pass**: There are no TODO comments in the test code.

6. **Check that mocking is used for dependencies where necessary using jest.fn().**
   - **Pass**: Dependencies are mocked appropriately using `jest.fn()` and `jest.mock()`.

7. **Verify that the testing environment setup code is included.**
   - **Pass**: The setup code includes necessary imports and mock configurations.

8. **Confirm that the testing environment setup code uses Jest and React Testing Library.**
   - **Pass**: The setup code uses Jest and React Testing Library.

9. **Ensure that the test file imports necessary modules such as React, Jest, React Testing Library, and the Select component.**
   - **Pass**: The test file imports React, Jest, React Testing Library, and the Select component.

10. **Verify that default props for the Select component are defined in the test file.**
    - **Pass**: Default props are defined in the test file.

11. **Check that the default props include all necessary properties for the Select component.**
    - **Pass**: The default props include all necessary properties for the Select component.

12. **Verify that the testing libraries are chosen appropriately.**
    - **Pass**: The testing libraries (Jest and React Testing Library) are appropriate for the task.

13. **Ensure the testing environment is set up correctly.**
    - **Pass**: The testing environment is set up correctly with necessary configurations and mocks.
