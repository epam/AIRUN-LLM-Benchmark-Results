# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Pass**: Verify that the test suite includes a test to render the component without crashing.
    - The test suite includes multiple tests that render the component, such as `it('renders with default placeholder')`.

2. **Fail**: Confirm that the test suite includes a test to open the menu when the control is clicked.
    - The test suite does not include a test that explicitly checks for opening the menu when the control is clicked.

3. **Pass**: Ensure the test suite includes a test to display options when the menu is open.
    - The test `it('displays menu options when menuIsOpen is true')` confirms this behavior.

4. **Pass**: Verify that the test suite includes a test to call the onChange callback when an option is selected.
    - The test `it('calls onChange with the correct value when option is selected')` confirms this behavior.

5. **Pass**: Confirm that the test suite includes a test to display the selected option.
    - The test `it('renders selected option')` confirms this behavior.

6. **Fail**: Ensure that the test suite includes a test to clear the selected option when the clear indicator is clicked.
    - The test suite does not include a test for clearing the selected option when the clear indicator is clicked.

7. **Pass**: Verify that the test suite includes a test to filter options based on the input value.
    - The test `it('applies custom filterOption function')` confirms this behavior.

8. **Pass**: Confirm that the test suite includes a test to display a loading message when the component is in a loading state.
    - The test `it('renders loading indicator when isLoading is true')` confirms this behavior.

9. **Pass**: Ensure that the test suite includes a test to display a "no options" message when there are no options available.
    - The test `it('shows no options message when no options are available')` confirms this behavior.

10. **Pass**: Verify that all tests are written using React Testing Library's render, screen, and fireEvent methods.
    - All tests use `render`, `screen`, and `fireEvent` methods from React Testing Library.

11. **Pass**: Ensure that all tests use the expect function from Jest to assert outcomes.
    - All tests use the `expect` function from Jest to assert outcomes.

12. **Pass**: Verify that the test for rendering the component checks for the presence of the placeholder text.
    - The test `it('renders with default placeholder')` checks for the presence of the placeholder text.

13. **Fail**: Ensure that the test for opening the menu checks for the presence of the role listbox.
    - The test suite does not include a test that explicitly checks for the presence of the role listbox when the menu is opened.

14. **Pass**: Confirm that the test for displaying options checks for the presence of option texts.
    - The test `it('displays menu options when menuIsOpen is true')` checks for the presence of option texts.

15. **Pass**: Ensure that the test for calling onChange verifies the correct arguments are passed to the callback.
    - The test `it('calls onChange with the correct value when option is selected')` verifies the correct arguments are passed to the callback.

16. **Pass**: Verify that the test for displaying the selected option checks for the presence of the option text.
    - The test `it('renders selected option')` checks for the presence of the option text.

17. **Fail**: Ensure that the test for clearing the selected option verifies the correct arguments are passed to the onChange callback.
    - The test suite does not include a test for clearing the selected option and verifying the correct arguments are passed to the onChange callback.

18. **Pass**: Confirm that the test for filtering options verifies that only matching options are displayed.
    - The test `it('applies custom filterOption function')` verifies that only matching options are displayed.

19. **Pass**: Ensure that the test for displaying the loading message checks for the presence of the loading text.
    - The test `it('renders loading indicator when isLoading is true')` checks for the presence of the loading text.

20. **Pass**: Verify that the test for displaying the "no options" message checks for the presence of the no options text.
    - The test `it('shows no options message when no options are available')` checks for the presence of the no options text.

### Summary

- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 20
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 15
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 5

Overall, the test suite is comprehensive but lacks tests for some specific interactions such as opening the menu on click, clearing the selected option, and checking for the presence of the role listbox.
