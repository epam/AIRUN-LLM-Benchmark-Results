Your task is to create an application on React 18.x that can utilize the SWAPI open API to fetch characters and display them in a list.

When completing the task, ensure to follow the instructions below:
- Use Create React App, TypeScript, and axios.
- Display a loader while loading.
- Do not include any input fields; only load the data initially and display it.
- Optimize the code where possible.
- The generated code should not contain any TODOs.
- Return the codebase without additional comments.

API Description:
GET https://swapi.dev/api/people?search={search}
Response:
{ results: Array<{ name: string, url: string }> }

### Answer:
<think>
Okay, I need to create a React 18.x app using TypeScript and axios to fetch and display SWAPI characters. Let's start by setting up the project with Create React App and TypeScript. The user mentioned no input fields, so data loads initially. I'll need to fetch data on component mount.

First, I'll create a functional component using React hooks. Use useState for storing characters and loading state. useEffect with an empty dependency array will trigger the fetch on mount. Axios will handle the GET request to the SWAPI endpoint. Since there's no search, the URL is just 'https://swapi.dev/api/people' without any query parameters.

Wait, the API description shows that the search parameter is optional. If we don't include it, does it return all characters? I think so. So the initial fetch will get the first page of people. But the problem is, the SWAPI paginates results. However, the user didn't mention handling pagination, so maybe just display the first page's results. The response has an array in results, so we'll take that.

Next, handle loading states. When the component mounts, set loading to true. Once the data is fetched, set the characters and set loading to false. If there's an error, maybe just log it, but the user didn't specify error handling, so perhaps ignore it for now.

For optimization, maybe use useCallback for the fetch function, but since it's inside useEffect and the dependencies are empty, it's okay. Alternatively, the effect can have the async function inside.

Wait, in React, the useEffect cleanup function can handle canceling requests if the component unmounts, but maybe that's overkill here. Since the user wants optimization, perhaps include a cleanup with axios cancel token.

Yes, that's a good point. Using AbortController with axios to cancel the request if the component unmounts before the request completes. So in useEffect, create an AbortController, pass the signal to axios, and return a cleanup function that aborts the controller.

Now, the component structure: a loading spinner when loading, then a list of characters. For the loader, maybe a simple div with "Loading..." text, but could use a better spinner. But the user didn't specify, so keep it simple.

The list should display each character's name. Each character has a name and url. Use map on the characters array to render list items. Add a key using the url since it's unique.

TypeScript interfaces: define an interface for the API response. The response has a results array of objects with name and url. So create a Character interface and an ApiResponse interface.

Axios response data will be of type ApiResponse. So in the axios.get, specify the generic type as ApiResponse.

Putting it all together:

- Create the component with useState and useEffect.
- Fetch data on mount, handle loading and errors.
- Display loading, then the list.
- TypeScript interfaces for the data.
- Optimize with abort controller.

Check for possible optimizations. Memoization isn't really needed here since the component is simple. But using async/await inside useEffect correctly, and aborting the request on unmount.

Testing: Make sure that the component renders the loader initially, then the list after data is fetched. Handle any potential memory leaks with the abort controller.

Now, code structure:

- App component.
- Use axios with async/await in useEffect.
- AbortController for cleanup.
- Interfaces for Character and ApiResponse.
- Conditional rendering based on loading state.

Edge cases: What if there are no characters? The SWAPI should return some, but maybe show a message if results are empty. The user didn't mention this, so perhaps skip it.

Now, write the code.

Here's the complete solution following your requirements:

1. First, install dependencies:
```bash
npx create-react-app swapi-list --template typescript
cd swapi-list
npm install axios
```

2. Replace the contents of `src/App.tsx` with:

```typescript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

interface Character {
  name: string;
  url: string;
}

interface ApiResponse {
  results: Character[];
}

function App() {
  const [characters, setCharacters] = useState<Character[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const controller = new AbortController();
    
    const fetchCharacters = async () => {
      try {
        const { data } = await axios.get<ApiResponse>(
          'https://swapi.dev/api/people',
          { signal: controller.signal }
        );
        setCharacters(data.results);
      } catch (error) {
        if (axios.isCancel(error)) return;
        console.error('Error fetching characters:', error);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    fetchCharacters();

    return () => controller.abort();
  }, []);

  if (loading) {
    return <div className="loader">Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div className="character-list">
      <h1>Star Wars Characters</h1>
      <ul>
        {characters.map((character) => (
          <li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

3. Add styles to `src/App.css`:

```css
.loader {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
  font-size: 1.5rem;
}

.character-list {
  max-width: 600px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 20px;
}

.character-list h1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: #2c3e50;
}

.character-list ul {
  list-style: none;
  padding: 0;
}

.character-list li {
  padding: 10px;
  margin: 5px 0;
  background-color: #ecf0f1;
  border-radius: 4px;
  transition: background-color 0.2s;
}

.character-list li:hover {
  background-color: #bdc3c7;
}
```

This solution includes:
- Type-safe API response handling
- Loading state management
- Request cancellation on component unmount
- Clean list presentation with basic styling
- Error handling (with console logging)
- Optimized network request handling
- Proper React 18 useEffect usage with cleanup
