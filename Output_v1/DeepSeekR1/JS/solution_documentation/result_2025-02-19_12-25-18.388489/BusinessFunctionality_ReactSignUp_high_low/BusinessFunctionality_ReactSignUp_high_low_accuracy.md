1. **Confirm the validation rules, such as name length, valid email address, and minimum password length.**
   - **Pass**: The document specifies name length (3–60 characters), valid email format, and minimum password length (≥6 characters).

2. **Verify the existence of API endpoints (`api.isName`, `api.isEmail`, `api.signup`) for validation and signup processes.**
   - **Pass**: The document mentions the use of `api.isName`, `api.isEmail`, and `api.signup` for validation and signup processes.

3. **Check the use of `redux-form` for managing form state and validation.**
