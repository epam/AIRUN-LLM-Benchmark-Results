# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### 1. Confirm that the application initializes correctly and loads persisted todos.
- **Pass**: The `TodoEffects` class includes an effect (`loadTodos$`) that loads todos from `localStorage` when the application initializes. This ensures that persisted todos are loaded correctly.

### 2. Ensure that the todo list displays correctly and is interactive.
- **Pass**: The `todo-list.component.html` correctly uses Angular's structural directives (`*ngIf`, `*ngFor`) to display the list of todos. The component also emits events for interactions like toggling, updating, and deleting todos.

### 3. Verify that adding a new todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `AppComponent` has an `addTodo` method that dispatches the `addTodo` action. The `todoReducer` handles this action by adding a new todo to the state.

### 4. Check that editing a todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `todo-item.component.html` includes logic for editing a todo. The `updateTodo` event is emitted with the updated todo, and the `AppComponent` dispatches the `updateTodo` action to update the state.

### 5. Confirm that toggling a todo item completion status works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `todo-item.component.html` includes a checkbox that toggles the completion status of a todo. The `toggleCompleted` method emits the `updateTodo` event, which is handled by the `AppComponent`.

### 6. Ensure that removing a todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `todo-item.component.html` includes a button that emits the `delete` event with the todo's ID. The `AppComponent` dispatches the `deleteTodo` action to remove the todo from the state.

### 7. Verify that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works.
- **Pass**: The `todo-list.component.html` includes a checkbox that toggles the completion status of all todos. The `toggleAll` event is emitted and handled by the `AppComponent`, which dispatches the `toggleAll` action.

### 8. Check that the filter functionality (All, Active, Completed) works.
- **Pass**: The `footer.component.html` includes links for filtering todos. The `RouterModule` is configured in `app.module.ts` to handle these routes, and the `AppComponent` uses selectors to filter todos based on the route.

### 9. Confirm that the "Clear completed" button works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `footer.component.html` includes a button that emits the `clearCompleted` event. The `AppComponent` dispatches the `clearCompleted` action to remove completed todos from the state.

### 10. Ensure that the application is responsive and functions correctly on different screen sizes.
- **Pass**: The provided HTML templates use standard HTML and CSS classes, which can be styled to be responsive. The functionality of the application is not dependent on screen size, ensuring it works correctly on different devices.
