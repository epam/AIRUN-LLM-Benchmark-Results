# Evaluation Report

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Check that the tests are isolated and do not depend on each other.**
   - **Pass**: Each test case is self-contained and does not rely on the state or outcome of other tests.

2. **Validate that the tests adhere to best practices for unit testing.**
   - **Pass**: The tests follow best practices, including clear setup, execution, and assertion phases. They also focus on specific functionalities of the Select component.

3. **Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.**
   - **Pass**: The code avoids duplication by using a `setup` function to initialize the component with default props.

4. **Ensure that the test suite achieves at least 80% code coverage for the Select component.**
   - **Pass**: The test suite covers a wide range of functionalities, including rendering, interaction, state management, and edge cases, which should result in high code coverage.

5. **Confirm that there are no TODO comments in the generated test code.**
   - **Pass**: There are no TODO comments in the test code.

6. **Check that mocking is used for dependencies where necessary using jest.fn().**
   - **Pass**: Mocking is appropriately used for internal components and functions using `jest.fn()`.

7. **Verify that the testing environment setup code is included.**
   - **Pass**: The setup code for the testing environment is included, such as importing necessary modules and defining default props.

8. **Confirm that the testing environment setup code uses Jest and React Testing Library.**
   - **Pass**: The setup code uses Jest and React Testing Library, as evidenced by the imports and usage of their functions.

9. **Ensure that the test file imports necessary modules such as React, Jest, React Testing Library, and the Select component.**
   - **Pass**: The test file imports React, Jest, React Testing Library, and the Select component.

10. **Verify that default props for the Select component are defined in the test file.**
    - **Pass**: Default props are defined in the `setup` function.

11. **Check that the default props include all necessary properties for the Select component.**
    - **Pass**: The default props include necessary properties such as `options`, `onChange`, `onInputChange`, `onMenuOpen`, and `onMenuClose`.

12. **Verify that the testing libraries are chosen appropriately.**
    - **Pass**: The chosen testing libraries, Jest and React Testing Library, are appropriate for unit testing React components.

13. **Ensure the testing environment is set up correctly.**
    - **Pass**: The testing environment is correctly set up with necessary imports, mocks, and default props.
