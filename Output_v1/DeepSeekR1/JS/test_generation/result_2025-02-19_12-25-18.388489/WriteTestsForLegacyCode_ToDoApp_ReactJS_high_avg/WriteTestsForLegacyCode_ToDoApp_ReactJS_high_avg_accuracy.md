# Evaluation Report

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Check that the tests are isolated and do not depend on each other.**
   - **Pass**: Each test case is self-contained and does not rely on the state or outcome of other tests.

2. **Validate that the tests adhere to best practices for unit testing.**
   - **Pass**: The tests follow best practices such as querying elements by accessible roles/text, simulating user interactions, and avoiding implementation details.

3. **Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.**
   - **Pass**: The code is well-structured without unnecessary duplication, adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

4. **Verify the test framework and libraries are chosen and listed appropriately.**
   - **Pass**: The test framework (Jest) and libraries (React Testing Library, @testing-library/jest-dom) are appropriately chosen and listed.

5. **Confirm the testing environment setup is included.**
   - **Pass**: The testing environment setup is included in the `setupTests.ts` file.

6. **Ensure the testing environment configuration file is present.**
   - **Pass**: The Jest configuration is included in the `package.json` file under the "jest" key.

7. **Validate the setup for the test environment is included.**
   - **Pass**: The setup for the test environment is included in the `setupTests.ts` file, which configures global objects and mocks.

8. **Ensure the tests cover at least 80% of the codebase.**
   - **Pass**: The provided test suite aims to achieve over 80% code coverage by covering all main components and their interactions.

9. **Confirm that mocking is used for dependencies where necessary.**
   - **Pass**: Mocking is appropriately used for dependencies such as `Router`, `localStorage`, and utility functions.

10. **Verify that the generated code does not contain any TODOs.**
    - **Pass**: The generated code does not contain any TODO comments or placeholders.
