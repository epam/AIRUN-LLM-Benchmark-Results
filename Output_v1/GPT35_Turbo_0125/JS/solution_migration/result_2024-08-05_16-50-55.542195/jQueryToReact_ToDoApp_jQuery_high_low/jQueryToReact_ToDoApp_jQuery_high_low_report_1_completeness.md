## Steps

### Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include an input field for creating a new todo. There is no implementation for handling the Enter key press to create a new todo.

### Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
- **Fail**: The code does not include any filtering functionality for displaying todo items according to the current filter.

### Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
- **Fail**: The code does not include functionality to toggle the completion status of all todos at once.

### Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
- **Pass**: Each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted. The `TodoItem` component includes handlers for toggling (`onToggle`), editing (`onEdit`), and deleting (`onDelete`) a todo item.

### Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
- **Fail**: The code includes functionality for starting editing with a double click and submitting by pressing Enter, but it does not handle the Esc button to reset the current editing to the initial value.

### Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
- **Fail**: The code does not include a footer that displays the count of active items, filter functionality, or a button to clear completed items.

### Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
- **Fail**: The code does not include a footer or a button to clear completed TODO items.
