Your task is to create a project configuration based on the Vite builder with support for React, Redux, React-Router, TypeScript, and testing library.

When generating the code, ensure to adhere to the instructions below:
- Describe the provided commands.
- Provide a package.json file.
- The generated code should not contain any TODOs.
- Simply return the codebase without additional comments within the code.

### Answer:
Here is the project configuration based on Vite builder with support for React, Redux, React-Router, TypeScript, and testing library:

1. Install Vite and create a new project:
```bash
npm init @vitejs/app my-react-redux-app --template react-ts
cd my-react-redux-app
```

2. Install Redux and React-Redux:
```bash
npm install redux react-redux @types/react-redux
```

3. Install React-Router:
```bash
npm install react-router-dom @types/react-router-dom
```

4. Install Testing Library and Jest for unit testing:
```bash
npm install @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event jest @types/jest
```

5. Update the `package.json` file:
```json
{
  "name": "my-react-redux-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "serve": "vite preview",
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
    "react-redux": "^7.2.5",
    "react-router-dom": "^5.3.0",
    "redux": "^4.1.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.14.1",
    "@testing-library/react": "^12.1.2",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^13.5.0",
    "@types/jest": "^27.0.3",
    "@types/react-redux": "^7.1.16",
    "@types/react-router-dom": "^5.1.9",
    "jest": "^27.2.4",
    "vite": "^2.6.4"
  }
}
```

This configuration provides a solid foundation for a React project with Redux, React-Router, TypeScript, and unit testing capabilities using Testing Library and Jest.
