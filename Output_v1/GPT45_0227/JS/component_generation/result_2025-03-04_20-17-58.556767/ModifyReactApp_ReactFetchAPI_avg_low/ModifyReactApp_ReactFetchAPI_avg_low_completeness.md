# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that a loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass**: The `loading` state is set to `true` before the API request and `false` after the request completes. A loading indicator (`<div>Loading...</div>`) is displayed based on the `loading` state.

### Step 2: Verify that the loader does not hide the search input when data is loading.
**Pass**: The search input field is always present in the DOM and is not hidden by the loading indicator.

### Step 3: Validate that a request with an empty search term is sent on the initial render.
**Pass**: The `useEffect` hook triggers `fetchCharacters` with an empty search term on the initial render.

### Step 4: Verify that the search input field is present.
**Pass**: The search input field is present in the JSX and is controlled by the `search` state.

### Step 5: Ensure that the character search functionality is implemented.
**Pass**: The search functionality is implemented using the `fetchCharacters` function, which makes an API request with the search term.

### Step 6: Ensure that the API request includes the search term as a query parameter.
**Pass**: The API request includes the search term as a query parameter using `params: { search: query }`.

### Step 7: Validate that the data is loading on initial app load with empty query and then when the search term changes.
**Pass**: The `useEffect` hook ensures that data is fetched on initial load and whenever the search term changes.

### Step 8: Ensure that the debounced fetch function prevents unnecessary API requests.
**Pass**: The `useEffect` hook uses a debounce timer (`setTimeout`) to delay the API request, preventing unnecessary requests.

### Step 9: Confirm that the character list is updated based on the search results.
**Pass**: The character list is updated based on the search results by setting the `characters` state with the response data.

### Step 10: Validate that the application handles API request errors.
**Pass**: The application handles API request errors by catching exceptions and logging an error message to the console.

### Step 11: Ensure that the user experience remains smooth without backend overloads.
**Pass**: The debounce mechanism and error handling ensure a smooth user experience without overloading the backend.
