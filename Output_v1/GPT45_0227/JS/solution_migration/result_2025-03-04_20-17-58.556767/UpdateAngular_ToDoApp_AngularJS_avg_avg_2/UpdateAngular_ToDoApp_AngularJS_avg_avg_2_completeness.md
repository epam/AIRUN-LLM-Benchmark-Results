# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Confirm that the application initializes correctly and loads persisted todos.**
   - **Pass**: The `ngOnInit` method in `TodoAppComponent` dispatches the `loadTodos` action, and the `TodoEffects` class handles loading todos from local storage.

2. **Ensure that the todo list displays correctly and is interactive.**
   - **Pass**: The `todo-app.component.html` uses `*ngFor` to iterate over `todos$` and displays each todo item using the `app-todo-item` component.

3. **Verify that adding a new todo works correctly.**
   - **Pass**: The `addTodo` method in `TodoAppComponent` dispatches the `addTodo` action, and the `todoReducer` handles adding the new todo to the state.

4. **Check that editing a todo works correctly.**
   - **Pass**: The `update` method in `TodoItemComponent` dispatches the `updateTodo` action, and the `todoReducer` handles updating the todo in the state.

5. **Confirm that toggling a todo item completion status works correctly.**
   - **Pass**: The `toggle` method in `TodoItemComponent` dispatches the `toggleTodo` action, and the `todoReducer` handles toggling the completion status of the todo in the state.

6. **Ensure that removing a todo works correctly.**
   - **Pass**: The `remove` method in `TodoItemComponent` dispatches the `removeTodo` action, and the `todoReducer` handles removing the todo from the state.

7. **Verify that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works.**
   - **Fail**: The provided code does not include an action or method for marking all todos as complete.

8. **Check that the filter functionality (All, Active, Completed) works.**
   - **Pass**: The `todo.selectors.ts` file includes selectors for filtering active and completed todos, which can be used in the component to implement the filter functionality.

9. **Confirm that the "Clear completed" button works correctly.**
   - **Pass**: The `clearCompleted` action is dispatched, and the `todoReducer` handles removing all completed todos from the state.

10. **Ensure that the application is responsive and functions correctly on different screen sizes.**
    - **Fail**: The provided code does not include any CSS or responsive design implementation details to confirm this step.
