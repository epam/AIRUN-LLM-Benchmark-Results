# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that the tests are isolated and do not depend on each other.
**Pass**: Each test is independent and uses `beforeEach` to clear all mocks, ensuring no shared state between tests.

### Step 2: Validate that the tests adhere to best practices for unit testing.
**Pass**: The tests are well-structured, focus on single functionalities, and use appropriate assertions.

### Step 3: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
**Pass**: The code is DRY, with no unnecessary duplication. Default props are defined once and reused.

### Step 4: Ensure that the test suite achieves at least 80% code coverage for the Select component.
**Pass**: The test suite covers a wide range of functionalities, suggesting high code coverage. However, actual coverage metrics are not provided.

### Step 5: Confirm that there are no TODO comments in the generated test code.
**Pass**: There are no TODO comments in the test code.

### Step 6: Check that mocking is used for dependencies where necessary using jest.fn().
**Pass**: Mocking is appropriately used for functions like `onChange`, `onInputChange`, `onMenuOpen`, and `onMenuClose`.

### Step 7: Verify that the testing environment setup code is included.
**Pass**: The setup code includes necessary imports and `beforeEach` for clearing mocks.

### Step 8: Confirm that the testing environment setup code uses Jest and React Testing Library.
**Pass**: The setup code uses Jest and React Testing Library, as indicated by the imports and usage.

### Step 9: Ensure that the test file imports necessary modules such as React, Jest, React Testing Library, and the Select component.
**Pass**: The test file imports React, Jest, React Testing Library, and the Select component.

### Step 10: Verify that default props for the Select component are defined in the test file.
**Pass**: Default props are defined in the test file.

### Step 11: Check that the default props include all necessary properties for the Select component.
**Pass**: The default props include a comprehensive set of properties for the Select component.

### Step 12: Verify that the testing libraries are chosen appropriately.
**Pass**: The chosen libraries (Jest and React Testing Library) are appropriate for testing React components.

### Step 13: Ensure the testing environment is set up correctly.
**Pass**: The testing environment is correctly set up with necessary imports and configurations.
