# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### 1. Confirm that unit tests are written for the signup.js file.
**Pass**: Unit tests are present in `__tests__/signup.test.js` for the `Signup` component.

### 2. Ensure that unit tests are written for the form.js file.
**Pass**: Unit tests are present in `__tests__/form.test.js` for the `FormGroup` component.

### 3. Ensure that the tests cover form field validation for the Signup component.
**Pass**: The test `validates form fields correctly` in `__tests__/signup.test.js` covers form field validation.

### 4. Verify that the tests cover form submission with valid data for the Signup component.
**Pass**: The test `handles successful signup` in `__tests__/signup.test.js` covers form submission with valid data.

### 5. Ensure that the tests include scenarios for handling async validation errors in the Signup component.
**Pass**: The test `async validates name and email uniqueness` in `__tests__/signup.test.js` covers async validation errors.

### 6. Confirm that the FormGroup component is tested for rendering children and displaying error messages.
**Pass**: The test `shows error message when field has error and is touched` in `__tests__/form.test.js` covers this scenario.

### 7. Verify that the FormGroup component is tested for rendering children without error messages.
**Pass**: The test `does not show error message when field is not touched` in `__tests__/form.test.js` covers this scenario.

### 8. Check that all PropTypes are validated in the tests.
**Fail**: The tests do not explicitly check for PropTypes validation.

### 9. Ensure that the tests are passing without any errors.
**Pass**: The provided code does not indicate any test failures.

### 10. Check that all required fields in the Signup component are tested for validation errors.
**Pass**: The test `validates form fields correctly` in `__tests__/signup.test.js` covers validation errors for all required fields.

### 11. Verify that the tests handle both synchronous and asynchronous operations correctly.
**Pass**: The tests use `waitFor` to handle asynchronous operations, ensuring they are tested correctly.

### 12. Ensure that the tests include edge cases for form input values (e.g., minimum and maximum length for name, invalid email format).
**Pass**: The test `validates form fields correctly` in `__tests__/signup.test.js` includes edge cases for form input values.
