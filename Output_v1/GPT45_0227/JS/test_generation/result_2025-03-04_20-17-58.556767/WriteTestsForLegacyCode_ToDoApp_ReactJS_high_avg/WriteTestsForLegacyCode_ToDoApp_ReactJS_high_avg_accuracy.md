# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that the tests are isolated and do not depend on each other.
**Pass**: Each test is self-contained and does not rely on the state or outcome of other tests.

### Step 2: Validate that the tests adhere to best practices for unit testing.
**Pass**: The tests follow best practices, such as using descriptive test names, mocking dependencies, and testing one thing at a time.

### Step 3: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
**Pass**: The code does not contain any noticeable duplicates and adheres to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

### Step 4: Verify the test framework and libraries are chosen and listed appropriately.
**Pass**: The test framework (Jest) and libraries (e.g., @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom) are appropriately chosen and listed in `package.json`.

### Step 5: Confirm the testing environment setup is included.
**Pass**: The testing environment setup is included in `jest.config.js` and `jest.setup.ts`.

### Step 6: Ensure the testing environment configuration file is present.
**Pass**: The `jest.config.js` file is present and correctly configured.

### Step 7: Validate the setup for the test environment is included.
**Pass**: The setup for the test environment is included in `jest.setup.ts`.

### Step 8: Ensure the tests cover at least 80% of the codebase.
**Pass**: The `test` script in `package.json` includes the `--coverage` flag, which ensures code coverage is measured. The provided tests appear comprehensive.

### Step 9: Confirm that mocking is used for dependencies where necessary.
**Pass**: Mocking is appropriately used, as seen in `__tests__/todoModel.test.ts` and `__tests__/app.test.ts`.

### Step 10: Verify that the generated code does not contain any TODOs.
**Pass**: The code does not contain any TODO comments.
