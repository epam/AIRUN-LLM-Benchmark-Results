Your task is to create a project configuration based on the Vite builder with support for React, Redux, React-Router, TypeScript, and testing library.

When generating the code, ensure to adhere to the instructions below:
- Describe the provided commands.
- Provide a package.json file.
- The generated code should not contain any TODOs.
- Simply return the codebase without additional comments within the code.

### Answer:
To set up a project configuration based on the Vite builder with support for React, Redux, React-Router, TypeScript, and the testing library, follow the steps below. This setup will provide you with a solid foundation for developing a React application with state management, routing, and testing capabilities.

### Step 1: Initialize the Project

First, you need to create a new project using Vite with React and TypeScript templates. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-react-redux-app -- --template react-ts
```

This command creates a new directory named `my-react-redux-app` with a React + TypeScript template set up by Vite.

### Step 2: Navigate to Your Project

Change into your project directory:

```bash
cd my-react-redux-app
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Now, install the necessary libraries for Redux, React-Router, and the testing library by running:

```bash
npm install redux react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit react-router-dom @testing-library/react @testing-library/user-event @testing-library/jest-dom
```

- `redux` and `react-redux` are used for state management.
- `@reduxjs/toolkit` is a toolset for efficient Redux development.
- `react-router-dom` is used for routing in React applications.
- `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/user-event`, and `@testing-library/jest-dom` are used for testing React components.

### Step 4: TypeScript Configuration

Ensure your `tsconfig.json` is set up for React. The Vite template should have already configured this for you, but here's a basic setup for reference:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "esnext",
    "module": "esnext",
    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"],
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "allowJs": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "strict": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

### Step 5: `package.json` Configuration

Below is the `package.json` file tailored to your project setup. This includes scripts for starting the development server, building the project, and running tests.

```json
{
  "name": "my-react-redux-app",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "test": "vitest"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@reduxjs/toolkit": "^1.8.0",
    "react": "^18.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.0.0",
    "react-redux": "^8.0.0",
    "react-router-dom": "^6.3.0",
    "redux": "^4.2.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.16.1",
    "@testing-library/react": "^13.0.0",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^14.0.0",
    "@types/react": "^18.0.0",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18.0.0",
    "@types/react-router-dom": "^5.3.2",
    "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^1.3.0",
    "typescript": "^4.5.4",
    "vite": "^2.9.0",
    "vitest": "^0.0.117"
  }
}
```

### Step 6: Running Your Project

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To build your project for production, use:

```bash
npm run build
```

To preview the production build locally, run:

```bash
npm run preview
```

To run your tests, execute:

```bash
npm test
```

This setup provides a comprehensive environment for developing a React application with Redux for state management, React-Router for navigation, TypeScript for type safety, and the testing library for unit and integration tests.
