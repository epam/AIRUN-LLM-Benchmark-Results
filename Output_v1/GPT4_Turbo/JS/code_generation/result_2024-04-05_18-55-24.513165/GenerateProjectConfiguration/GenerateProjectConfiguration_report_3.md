Your task is to create a project configuration based on the Vite builder with support for React, Redux, React-Router, TypeScript, and testing library.

When generating the code, ensure to adhere to the instructions below:
- Describe the provided commands.
- Provide a package.json file.
- The generated code should not contain any TODOs.
- Simply return the codebase without additional comments within the code.

### Answer:
To create a project configuration based on the Vite builder with support for React, Redux, React-Router, TypeScript, and testing library, follow the steps below. This setup will help you get started with a modern, fast development environment for building React applications.

### Step 1: Initialize the Project

First, you need to create a new project using Vite with React and TypeScript templates. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react-ts
```

This command creates a new directory named `my-react-app` with a basic Vite project setup for React and TypeScript.

### Step 2: Navigate to Your Project

Change into your project directory:

```bash
cd my-react-app
```

### Step 3: Install Additional Dependencies

Now, install Redux, React-Router, and the necessary testing libraries (React Testing Library, Jest) along with their TypeScript types and Vite plugins if needed.

```bash
npm install redux react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit react-router-dom
npm install --save-dev @types/react-redux @types/react-router-dom jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event vite-plugin-testing
```

### Step 4: Configure Jest

Create a `jest.config.js` file in your project root and add the following configuration for Jest:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect'],
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.tsx?$': 'ts-jest',
  },
  moduleNameMapper: {
    '\\.(css|less|sass|scss)$': 'identity-obj-proxy',
  },
};
```

This configuration sets up Jest with support for TypeScript, React Testing Library, and mocks for CSS modules.

### Step 5: Update `tsconfig.json`

Ensure your `tsconfig.json` supports JSX and includes the necessary settings for React and Jest. An example configuration:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "esnext",
    "useDefineForClassFields": true,
    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"],
    "allowJs": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "strict": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "module": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "jsx": "react-jsx"
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

### Step 6: `package.json` Configuration

Your `package.json` should include scripts for building, serving, and testing your application. Here's an example configuration that includes everything you've set up:

```json
{
  "name": "my-react-app",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.0.0",
    "react-redux": "^8.0.0",
    "redux": "^4.1.2",
    "@reduxjs/toolkit": "^1.8.0",
    "react-router-dom": "^6.3.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/react": "^18.0.0",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18.0.0",
    "@types/react-redux": "^8.0.0",
    "@types/react-router-dom": "^5.3.2",
    "typescript": "^4.5.4",
    "vite": "^2.9.0",
    "jest": "^27.4.5",
    "@testing-library/react": "^12.1.2",
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.16.1",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^13.5.0",
    "ts-jest": "^27.1.2",
    "vite-plugin-testing": "^0.0.1"
  }
}
```

### Step 7: Running Your Project

To start the development server, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To build your project for production, use:

```bash
npm run build
```

To preview the production build locally, use:

```bash
npm run preview
```

To run your tests, use:

```bash
npm test
```

This setup provides a solid foundation for developing React applications with Redux, React-Router, TypeScript, and a testing environment ready to go.
