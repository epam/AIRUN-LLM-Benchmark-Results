Your task is to create a project configuration based on the Vite builder with support for React, Redux, React-Router, TypeScript, and testing library.

When generating the code, ensure to adhere to the instructions below:
- Describe the provided commands.
- Provide a package.json file.
- The generated code should not contain any TODOs.
- Simply return the codebase without additional comments within the code.

### Answer:
To set up a project configuration based on the Vite builder with support for React, Redux, React-Router, TypeScript, and the testing library, follow the steps below. This setup will provide you with a fast development environment, type safety with TypeScript, state management with Redux, routing with React-Router, and a testing setup with React Testing Library.

### Step 1: Initialize the Project

First, you need to create a new project directory and initialize a new project with Vite. Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir my-vite-react-app
cd my-vite-react-app
npm create vite . -- --template react-ts
```

These commands create a new directory for your project, navigate into it, and then use `npm create vite` to scaffold a new React project with TypeScript support.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Next, you need to install the additional dependencies required for Redux, React-Router, and the testing library.

```bash
npm install redux react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit react-router-dom
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/user-event @testing-library/jest-dom
```

This installs Redux and its toolkit for state management, React-Router for navigation, and the necessary testing libraries for unit testing your components.

### Step 3: Configure TypeScript

Your `tsconfig.json` file should already be configured for a basic React and TypeScript project. Ensure it includes the following settings for optimal developer experience:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "esnext",
    "module": "esnext",
    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"],
    "allowJs": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "strict": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "jsx": "react-jsx"
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

### Step 4: `package.json` Configuration

Below is the `package.json` file that includes the scripts and dependencies for your project setup:

```json
{
  "name": "my-vite-react-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "serve": "vite preview",
    "test": "vitest"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.0.0",
    "react-redux": "^8.0.0",
    "redux": "^4.0.0",
    "react-router-dom": "^6.0.0",
    "@reduxjs/toolkit": "^1.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^1.0.0",
    "typescript": "^4.0.0",
    "@testing-library/react": "^12.0.0",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^13.0.0",
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.0.0",
    "vite": "^2.0.0"
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Running Your Project

To start your development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command starts the Vite development server, allowing you to see your application in the browser.

To build your project for production, use:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command compiles your TypeScript and React files into static assets ready for production.

To serve your production build locally, run:

```bash
npm run serve
```

This command serves your build directory on a local server.

To run your tests, use:

```bash
npm test
```

This command runs your test suite using Vitest, a Vite-native test runner compatible with Testing Library.

### Conclusion

You now have a fully configured project with Vite, React, Redux, React-Router, TypeScript, and the testing library. This setup provides a solid foundation for building scalable and maintainable web applications with a modern development stack.
