Your task is to create an application on React 18.x that can utilize the SWAPI open API to fetch characters and display them in a list.

When completing the task, ensure to follow the instructions below:
- Use Create React App, TypeScript, and axios.
- Display a loader while loading.
- Do not include any input fields; only load the data initially and display it.
- Optimize the code where possible.
- The generated code should not contain any TODOs.
- Return the codebase without additional comments.

API Description:
GET https://swapi.dev/api/people?search={search}
Response:
{ results: Array<{ name: string, url: string }> }

### Answer:
To accomplish the task, follow these steps to create a React application that fetches and displays characters from the SWAPI API using Create React App, TypeScript, and axios.

### Step 1: Setting Up the Project

First, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. Then, open your terminal and run the following command to create a new React application with TypeScript:

```bash
npx create-react-app swapi-characters --template typescript
```

Navigate into your project directory:

```bash
cd swapi-characters
```

### Step 2: Installing Axios

Run the following command to install axios, which you will use to make API requests:

```bash
npm install axios
```

### Step 3: Creating the Character List Component

Create a new file `CharacterList.tsx` in the `src` directory. This component will be responsible for fetching the characters from the SWAPI and displaying them.

```tsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

interface Character {
  name: string;
  url: string;
}

const CharacterList: React.FC = () => {
  const [characters, setCharacters] = useState<Character[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchCharacters = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await axios.get('https://swapi.dev/api/people');
        setCharacters(response.data.results);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to fetch characters:', error);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    fetchCharacters();
  }, []);

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <ul>
      {characters.map((character) => (
        <li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};

export default CharacterList;
```

### Step 4: Updating the App Component

Open the `App.tsx` file and update it to include the `CharacterList` component:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';
import CharacterList from './CharacterList';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <CharacterList />
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Step 5: Running the Application

Now, you can run your application to see the list of characters fetched from the SWAPI:

```bash
npm start
```

This setup follows the instructions provided, including using Create React App with TypeScript, utilizing axios for API requests, displaying a loader while data is being fetched, and optimizing the code for readability and performance.
