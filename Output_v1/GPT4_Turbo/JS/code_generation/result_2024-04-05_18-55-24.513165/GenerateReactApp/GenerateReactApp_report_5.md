Your task is to create an application on React 18.x that can utilize the SWAPI open API to fetch characters and display them in a list.

When completing the task, ensure to follow the instructions below:
- Use Create React App, TypeScript, and axios.
- Display a loader while loading.
- Do not include any input fields; only load the data initially and display it.
- Optimize the code where possible.
- The generated code should not contain any TODOs.
- Return the codebase without additional comments.

API Description:
GET https://swapi.dev/api/people?search={search}
Response:
{ results: Array<{ name: string, url: string }> }

### Answer:
To accomplish the task of creating a React application that fetches and displays characters from the SWAPI API, follow the steps below. This guide assumes you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.

### Step 1: Setting Up the Project

1. **Create a New React App**: Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new React app using Create React App with TypeScript template.

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app swapi-characters --template typescript
   ```

2. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd swapi-characters
   ```

3. **Install Axios**: Run the following command to add Axios to your project for making HTTP requests.

   ```bash
   npm install axios
   ```

### Step 2: Creating the Character List Component

1. **Create a New Component**: Inside the `src` directory, create a new file named `CharacterList.tsx`. This component will be responsible for fetching the characters from the SWAPI and displaying them.

2. **Implement the CharacterList Component**: Edit the `CharacterList.tsx` file to include the following code.

   ```tsx
   import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
   import axios from 'axios';

   interface Character {
     name: string;
     url: string;
   }

   const CharacterList: React.FC = () => {
     const [characters, setCharacters] = useState<Character[]>([]);
     const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(true);

     useEffect(() => {
       const fetchCharacters = async () => {
         try {
           const response = await axios.get('https://swapi.dev/api/people');
           setCharacters(response.data.results);
         } catch (error) {
           console.error('Failed to fetch characters:', error);
         } finally {
           setLoading(false);
         }
       };

       fetchCharacters();
     }, []);

     if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;

     return (
       <ul>
         {characters.map((character) => (
           <li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>
         ))}
       </ul>
     );
   };

   export default CharacterList;
   ```

### Step 3: Displaying the Character List in the App

1. **Modify the App Component**: Open the `App.tsx` file and modify it to include the `CharacterList` component.

   ```tsx
   import React from 'react';
   import './App.css';
   import CharacterList from './CharacterList';

   function App() {
     return (
       <div className="App">
         <header className="App-header">
           <h1>SWAPI Characters</h1>
           <CharacterList />
         </header>
       </div>
     );
   }

   export default App;
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Go back to your terminal and start the application by running:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Your application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000/`. It will display a loading message until it fetches the characters from the SWAPI, after which it will display them in a list.

This setup follows the instructions provided, including using React 18.x, TypeScript, Axios for data fetching, displaying a loader while loading, and optimizing the code where possible without leaving any TODOs or additional comments in the codebase.
