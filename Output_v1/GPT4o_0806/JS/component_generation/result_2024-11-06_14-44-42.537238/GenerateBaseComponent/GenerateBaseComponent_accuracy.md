# Evaluation Report

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.**
   - **Pass**: The code does not contain any unused imports or code.

2. **Ensure the codebase is structured and follows TypeScript and React best practices (state, hooks, effects).**
   - **Pass**: The codebase is well-structured and follows TypeScript and React best practices, including the use of state, hooks, and effects.

3. **Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.**
   - **Pass**: The use of `useEffect` to add and remove event listeners ensures there are no memory leaks. The state updates are managed efficiently to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

4. **Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.**
   - **Pass**: The code is compatible with the latest versions of React and TypeScript.

5. **Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.**
   - **Pass**: The code does not contain any console errors or warnings.

6. **Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.**
   - **Pass**: The app uses React state to manage the values of text fields instead of directly accessing DOM elements.

7. **Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React virtual DOM.**
   - **Pass**: The app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React's virtual DOM.

8. **Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React state and props.**
   - **Pass**: The app uses refs appropriately and relies on React state and props for managing component state.

9. **Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.**
   - **Pass**: The app manages state changes efficiently to avoid excessive re-renders.

10. **Ensure the code adheres to accessibility standards (e.g., ARIA roles).**
    - **Pass**: The code includes ARIA roles and attributes to ensure accessibility.

11. **Ensure the component is written in TypeScript.**
    - **Pass**: The component is written in TypeScript.

12. **Verify the component is created using React 18.x.**
    - **Pass**: The component is compatible with React 18.x.

13. **Verify the presence of an index.css file.**
    - **Pass**: The code includes an `index.css` file.

14. **Check that the generated code does not contain any TODOs.**
    - **Pass**: The code does not contain any TODOs.

15. **App does correctly use useEffect, avoiding infinite loops.**
    - **Pass**: The `useEffect` hooks are used correctly, avoiding infinite loops.
