## Step 1: Confirm that the state slices for page and user are correctly defined and managed.
**Pass**: The state slices for `page` and `user` are correctly defined using `createSlice` from `@reduxjs/toolkit`. The `pageSlice` includes actions for setting and resetting the page state, while the `userSlice` is defined with an initial state but no actions.

## Step 2: Verify that API service functions are correctly defined and used.
**Pass**: The API service functions (`fetchContent`, `saveContent`, `updateContent`, `deleteContent`) are correctly defined using `axios` and are used appropriately in the `PageEditor` component.

## Step 3: Ensure that the application correctly handles all the functionalities from the original Angular code.
**Pass**: The application handles functionalities such as fetching, saving, updating, and deleting page content. The `PageEditor` component includes methods to handle these actions and updates the Redux state accordingly.

## Step 4: Verify that all functionalities like save, delete, update, and tag management are working correctly.
**Pass**: The `PageEditor` component includes methods to save, delete, and update page content. Tag management is handled by converting the tags string to an array and vice versa.
