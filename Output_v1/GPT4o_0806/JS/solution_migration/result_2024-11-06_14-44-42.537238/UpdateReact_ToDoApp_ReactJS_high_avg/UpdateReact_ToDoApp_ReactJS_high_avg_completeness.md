# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
- **Pass**: The `TodoApp.tsx` file contains an input field with the class `new-todo`. The `handleNewTodoKeyDown` function handles the `Enter` key press, retrieves the value from the input field, and dispatches the `addTodo` action to the store.

### Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
- **Pass**: The `TodoApp.tsx` file filters the todos based on the `nowShowing` state and displays them in a list. The filtering logic is implemented in the `shownTodos` variable.

### Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
- **Pass**: The `TodoApp.tsx` file includes a checkbox with the id `toggle-all` that toggles the completion status of all todos. The `onChange` event of this checkbox dispatches the `toggleAll` action to the store.

### Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItem.tsx` file includes functionality to toggle, edit, and delete each todo item. The `toggleTodo`, `saveTodo`, and `destroyTodo` actions are dispatched accordingly.

### Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItem.tsx` file handles double-clicking to start editing, pressing Enter to submit, and pressing Esc to reset the editing state. The `handleEdit`, `handleSubmit`, and `handleKeyDown` functions manage these actions.

### Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFooter.tsx` file displays the count of active items, includes filter functionality, and has a button to clear completed items. The `count`, `completedCount`, and `nowShowing` props are used to manage these features.

### Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFooter.tsx` file includes a button with the class `clear-completed` that dispatches the `clearCompleted` action when clicked.
