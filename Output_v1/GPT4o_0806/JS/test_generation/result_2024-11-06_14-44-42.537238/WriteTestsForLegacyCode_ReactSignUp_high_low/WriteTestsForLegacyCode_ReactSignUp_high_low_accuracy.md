# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### 1. Check that the tests are isolated and do not depend on each other.
**Pass**: Each test case is independent and does not rely on the state or outcome of other tests.

### 2. Validate that the tests adhere to best practices for unit testing.
**Pass**: The tests follow best practices by being specific, isolated, and testing one thing at a time.

### 3. Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
**Pass**: The code avoids duplication by using helper functions like `renderComponent` to render the component with necessary props.

### 4. Verify that the testing environment is set up correctly.
**Pass**: The necessary testing libraries are installed, and the environment is set up correctly with Jest and React Testing Library.

### 5. Check if a testing library for JavaScript (such as Jest) has been chosen.
**Pass**: Jest is chosen as the testing library, which is a popular and suitable choice for JavaScript testing.

### 6. Validate that dependencies are mocked where necessary, such as API calls.
**Pass**: The `api` module and `Link` component from `react-router` are mocked appropriately to isolate the tests from external dependencies.

### 7. Verify that the test coverage for the code is at least 80%.
**Fail**: The provided information does not include test coverage metrics. This needs to be verified by running the tests and generating a coverage report.

### 8. Confirm that the package.json file includes necessary dependencies and scripts for running tests.
**Fail**: The provided information does not include the `package.json` file. This needs to be checked to ensure all necessary dependencies and scripts are included.

### 9. Confirm that the tests use the proper methods and assertions from the chosen testing library.
**Pass**: The tests use appropriate methods and assertions from React Testing Library and Jest, such as `render`, `screen`, `fireEvent`, and `waitFor`.
