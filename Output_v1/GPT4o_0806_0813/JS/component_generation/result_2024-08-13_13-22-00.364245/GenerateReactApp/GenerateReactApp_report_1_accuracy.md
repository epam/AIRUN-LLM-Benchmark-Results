# Evaluation Report

## Steps Evaluation

### 1. Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.
**Pass**: The provided code does not contain any unused imports or code.

### 2. Ensure the codebase is structured and follows TypeScript and React best practices (state, hooks, effects).
**Pass**: The codebase uses TypeScript interfaces, React functional components, and hooks (useState, useEffect) appropriately.

### 3. Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.
**Pass**: The useEffect hook is used correctly to fetch data once when the component mounts, preventing unnecessary re-renders.

### 4. Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.
**Pass**: The code uses modern React and TypeScript features, ensuring compatibility with the latest versions.

### 5. Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.
**Pass**: The code does not contain any obvious issues that would cause console errors or warnings.

### 6. Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.
**Pass**: The application does not access DOM elements directly to retrieve values.

### 7. Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React’s virtual DOM.
**Pass**: The application does not manipulate the DOM directly; it relies on React's virtual DOM.

### 8. Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React’s state and props.
**Pass**: The application does not use refs unnecessarily; it uses state and props appropriately.

### 9. Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.
**Pass**: The useEffect hook ensures that data fetching only occurs once, preventing excessive re-renders.

### 10. Ensure the code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility.
**Pass**: The code is decomposed into `CharacterList` and `App` components, each with a single responsibility.

### 11. Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
**Pass**: The code does not contain any duplicate logic and follows DRY principles.

### 12. App has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.
**Pass**: The provided code ensures the DOM tree structure is consistent with the expected output.

### 13. App does correctly use useEffect, avoiding infinite loops.
**Pass**: The useEffect hook is used correctly with an empty dependency array to avoid infinite loops.

### 14. Confirm that axios is installed and listed as a dependency in package.json.
**Pass**: The instructions include installing axios, which would be listed as a dependency in package.json.

### 15. Verify that the fetched data is stored in a state variable using the useState hook.
**Pass**: The fetched data is stored in the `characters` state variable using the useState hook.

### 16. Verify that the code is optimized and does not contain any unnecessary parts or TODOs.
**Pass**: The code is optimized and does not contain any unnecessary parts or TODOs.

### 17. Ensure that TypeScript is correctly integrated and used throughout the codebase.
**Pass**: TypeScript is correctly integrated and used throughout the codebase, with appropriate type annotations.

### 18. Verify that React.StrictMode is used in index.tsx.
**Fail**: The provided instructions do not mention using React.StrictMode in index.tsx.
