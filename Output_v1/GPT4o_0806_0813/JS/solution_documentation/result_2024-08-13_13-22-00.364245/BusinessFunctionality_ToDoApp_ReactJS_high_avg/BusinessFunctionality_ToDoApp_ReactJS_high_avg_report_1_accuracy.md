# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Pass**: Confirm that constraints related to local storage limitations are noted.
    - The report mentions that the application relies on the browser's local storage for data persistence, which may not be suitable for large datasets or shared environments.

2. **Pass**: Verify that assumptions about the application being designed for a single user are mentioned.
    - The report states that the application is designed for single-user use and does not support multi-user data management or synchronization.

3. **Fail**: Ensure that browser compatibility assumptions are included.
    - The report does not mention any assumptions or considerations regarding browser compatibility.

4. **Pass**: Check that performance-related constraints are noted.
    - The report discusses the use of local storage and its limitations for large datasets, which is a performance-related constraint.

5. **Pass**: Confirm that performance optimizations, such as the use of `shouldComponentUpdate`, are identified.
    - The report identifies the use of the `shouldComponentUpdate` method in `TodoItem` to prevent unnecessary re-renders, enhancing performance.

6. **Pass**: Verify that considerations for using immutable data structures for performance are mentioned.
    - The report mentions the use of immutable data structures (e.g., `map`, `filter`, `reduce`) to manage todos, which can improve performance.

7. **Pass**: Ensure scalability considerations related to local storage limitations are discussed.
    - The report discusses that while local storage is suitable for small to medium-sized datasets, it may not scale well for applications with a large number of todos or complex data structures.

8. **Fail**: Check that the potential need for a backend service for better scalability is mentioned.
    - The report does not mention the potential need for a backend service to improve scalability.

9. **Pass**: Confirm that the evaluation steps are unambiguous and concise.
    - The evaluation steps are clear and concise, allowing for straightforward assessment.

10. **Pass**: Ensure that each step allows the evaluator to assess the output based solely on the provided code.
    - The steps are designed to assess the output based on the provided code and the report.

11. **Pass**: Verify that the steps are clearly articulated and cover all main points of the task.
    - The steps are clearly articulated and cover the main points of the task, except for the two noted failures.

### Summary

- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 11
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 9
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 2

Overall, the evaluation report is comprehensive and covers most of the necessary points, with minor omissions regarding browser compatibility and the potential need for a backend service for better scalability.
