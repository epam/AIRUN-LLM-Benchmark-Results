1. **Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.**
   - **Pass**: All imports in the provided code are used.

2. **Ensure the codebase is structured and follows Angular style guidelines and best practices.**
   - **Pass**: The code is well-structured and follows Angular style guidelines.

3. **Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of Angular and TypeScript.**
   - **Pass**: The code uses modern Angular and TypeScript features, indicating compatibility with the latest versions.

4. **Verify the application works correctly across modern browsers.**
   - **Fail**: This step requires running the application in multiple browsers, which is not possible in this static evaluation.

5. **Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.**
   - **Fail**: This step requires running the application to check for console errors and warnings, which is not possible in this static evaluation.

6. **Ensure the code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility.**
   - **Pass**: The code is decomposed into multiple components, each with a single responsibility.

7. **Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.**
   - **Pass**: The code does not contain any noticeable duplicates and follows DRY principles.

8. **Ensure the application handles API errors.**
   - **Fail**: The `handleSubmit` method in `SignupComponent` does not handle API errors properly; it only contains a comment placeholder.

9. **Validate that @ngrx/store is used for state management and that the state is properly defined in auth.reducer.ts and app.state.ts.**
   - **Fail**: The provided code does not include `auth.reducer.ts` and `app.state.ts` files, so proper state management cannot be verified.

10. **Verify the UI and UX by running the Angular application and ensuring that the signup form behaves as expected, including form validation and error messages.**
    - **Fail**: This step requires running the application to verify UI and UX, which is not possible in this static evaluation.

11. **Confirm that the signup action is correctly dispatched from the SignupComponent upon form submission.**
    - **Pass**: The `handleSubmit` method correctly dispatches the `signupComplete` action upon successful form submission.

12. **Verify app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of Angular’s framework.**
    - **Pass**: The code does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of Angular’s framework.

13. **Verify app does not overuse Angular references for DOM access instead of Angular’s state and props.**
    - **Pass**: The code uses Angular’s state and props appropriately and does not overuse Angular references for DOM access.

14. **Check that there are no TODOs or incomplete parts in the code.**
    - **Pass**: There are no TODOs or incomplete parts in the provided code.
