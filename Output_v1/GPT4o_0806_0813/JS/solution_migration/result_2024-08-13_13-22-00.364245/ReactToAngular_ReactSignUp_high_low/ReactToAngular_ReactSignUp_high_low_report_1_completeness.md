### Evaluation Steps:

1. **Verify that all React components and their functionalities are correctly translated into Angular components.**
   - **Pass**: The provided code includes Angular components (`SignupComponent`, `FormGroupComponent`) that replicate the functionality of the React components.

2. **Ensure that the form validation logic is implemented using Angular's reactive forms.**
   - **Pass**: The `signupForm` in `SignupComponent` is created using Angular's `FormBuilder` with appropriate validation rules.

3. **Check that the application includes the necessary form controls and validation rules.**
   - **Pass**: The form controls for `name`, `email`, and `password` are included with validation rules such as `required`, `minLength`, `maxLength`, and `email`.

4. **Confirm that the application correctly binds the form controls and handles form submission.**
   - **Pass**: The form controls are correctly bound using `formControlName` and the form submission is handled by the `handleSubmit` method.

5. **Ensure the application correctly displays form validation errors.**
   - **Pass**: The `FormGroupComponent` displays validation errors using `field.touched` and `field.invalid` checks.

6. **Verify that the application contains actions for signup, signup success, and signup failure.**
   - **Fail**: The provided code includes an action for `signupComplete` but does not include actions for signup initiation or signup failure.

7. **Ensure that the auth.effects.ts file correctly handles side effects using @ngrx/effects, including calling the API and dispatching success or failure actions.**
   - **Fail**: The provided code does not include `auth.effects.ts` or any effects handling side effects using `@ngrx/effects`.

8. **Validate that the API call to signup is correctly integrated and that the response is handled properly.**
   - **Pass**: The `ApiService` includes a `signup` method that makes an HTTP POST request, and the `handleSubmit` method in `SignupComponent` handles the response.

9. **Confirm that the application navigates to the login page correctly when the link is clicked.**
   - **Pass**: The `routerLink` directive in the template correctly navigates to the login page.
