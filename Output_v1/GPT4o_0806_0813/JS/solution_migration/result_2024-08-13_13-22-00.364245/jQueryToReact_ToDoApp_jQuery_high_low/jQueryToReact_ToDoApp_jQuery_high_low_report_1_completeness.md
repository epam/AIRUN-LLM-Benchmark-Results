# Evaluation Report

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.**
    - **Pass**: The `Header` component contains an input field with the class `new-todo`. The `handleKeyDown` function checks for the Enter key and dispatches the `addTodo` action with the trimmed title from the state.

2. **Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.**
    - **Pass**: The `TodoList` component uses the `useSelector` hook to get the `todos` and `filter` from the state. It filters the todos based on the current filter and maps them to `TodoItem` components.

3. **Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.**
    - **Pass**: The `MainSection` component includes a checkbox with the class `toggle-all`. The `onChange` event dispatches the `toggleAll` action with the negated value of `allCompleted`.

4. **Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.**
    - **Pass**: The `TodoItem` component includes:
        - A checkbox to toggle the completion status, which dispatches the `toggleTodo` action.
        - A label that can be double-clicked to start editing.
        - A button with the class `destroy` to delete the todo, which dispatches the `deleteTodo` action.

5. **Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.**
    - **Pass**: The `TodoItem` component includes:
        - A `handleEdit` function that sets the `editing` state to `true` on double-click.
        - An input field that handles `onBlur` and `onKeyDown` events. The `handleBlur` function dispatches the `editTodo` action or deletes the todo if the title is empty. The `handleKeyDown` function checks for Enter and Escape keys to submit or reset the editing state, respectively.

6. **Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.**
    - **Pass**: The `Footer` component:
        - Displays the count of active items using the `activeCount` variable.
        - Includes filter links that dispatch the `setFilter` action with the appropriate filter value.
        - Includes a button to clear completed items, which dispatches the `clearCompleted` action.

7. **Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.**
    - **Pass**: The `Footer` component includes a button with the class `clear-completed` that dispatches the `clearCompleted` action when clicked.
