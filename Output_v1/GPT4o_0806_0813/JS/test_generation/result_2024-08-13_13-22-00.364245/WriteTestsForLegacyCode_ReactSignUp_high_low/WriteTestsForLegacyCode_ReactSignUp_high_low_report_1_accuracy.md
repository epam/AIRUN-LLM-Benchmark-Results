# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### 1. Check that the tests are isolated and do not depend on each other.
**Pass**: Each test is self-contained and does not rely on the state or outcome of other tests.

### 2. Validate that the tests adhere to best practices for unit testing.
**Pass**: The tests follow best practices, such as using descriptive test names, mocking dependencies, and testing both positive and negative scenarios.

### 3. Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
**Pass**: The code does not contain unnecessary duplicates and adheres to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

### 4. Verify that the testing environment is set up correctly.
**Pass**: The necessary testing libraries are installed, and the environment is correctly set up with Jest and React Testing Library.

### 5. Check if a testing library for JavaScript (such as Jest) has been chosen.
**Pass**: Jest is chosen as the testing library, which is appropriate for this context.

### 6. Validate that dependencies are mocked where necessary, such as API calls.
**Pass**: The `api` module and `react-router` are mocked to simulate API responses and routing behavior.

### 7. Verify that the test coverage for the code is at least 80%.
**Fail**: The provided information does not include test coverage metrics. This needs to be verified separately.

### 8. Confirm that the package.json file includes necessary dependencies and scripts for running tests.
**Fail**: The `package.json` file is not provided, so it cannot be confirmed if it includes the necessary dependencies and scripts.

### 9. Confirm that the tests use the proper methods and assertions from the chosen testing library.
**Pass**: The tests use appropriate methods and assertions from Jest and React Testing Library, such as `render`, `screen`, `fireEvent`, and `waitFor`.
