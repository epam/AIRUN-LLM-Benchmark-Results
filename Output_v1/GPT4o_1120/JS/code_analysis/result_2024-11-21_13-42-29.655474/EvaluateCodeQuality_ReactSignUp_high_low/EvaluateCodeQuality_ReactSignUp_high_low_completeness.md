## Readability

### 1. Use of Deprecated `PropTypes` Import
- **Pass**: The `PropTypes` import is updated to import from the `prop-types` package.

### 2. Inline Function Binding in `render`

### 3. Clear and Concise Variable Names
- **Pass**: The code uses clear and concise variable names.

### 4. Explanatory Comments for Complex Code Blocks
- **Pass**: Explanatory comments are added to complex code blocks.

### 5. Functions Defined Outside of `render`
- **Pass**: Functions are defined outside of the `render` method to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

## Maintainability

### 1. Hardcoded Field Names
- **Pass**: Field names are defined in a single constant and reused.

### 2. Non-Reusable Validation Logic
- **Pass**: Validation logic is extracted into reusable utility functions.

### 3. Repetitive Code Refactored
- **Pass**: Repetitive code is refactored into reusable functions or components.

### 4. Consistent Coding Style and Conventions
- **Pass**: The code adheres to a consistent coding style and conventions.

## Performance

### 1. Binding Functions in Constructor
- **Pass**: Functions are bound in the constructor instead of inline in the `render` method.

### 2. Optimized Performance Bottlenecks
- **Pass**: Potential performance bottlenecks, such as unnecessary re-renders or heavy computations in the render method, are optimized.

### 3. Use of Memoization Techniques
- **Pass**: Memoization techniques are used where applicable to improve performance.

## Accessibility

### 1. Missing `aria-label` for Inputs
- **Pass**: `aria-label` attributes are added to input fields.

### 2. Missing `role` for Error Messages

## Best Practices

### 1. Avoid Inline Styles in JSX
