# Evaluation Report

## Readability
### 1. Use of `var` instead of `let` or `const`
**Pass** - The code correctly identifies the use of `var` and suggests using `let` or `const` for better readability and scoping.

### 2. Inline event handlers
**Pass** - The code correctly identifies the use of inline event handlers and suggests moving them to named methods for better readability and debugging.

### 3. Use of `refs` for DOM manipulation
**Pass** - The code correctly identifies the outdated use of `refs` and suggests using `React.createRef` or `useRef` instead.

## Maintainability
### 1. Hardcoded strings for routes
**Pass** - The code correctly identifies the use of hardcoded strings for routes and suggests using constants for better maintainability.

### 2. Centralize state management
**Pass** - The code correctly identifies the need for centralized state management and suggests using a state management library like Redux or Context API.

## Performance
### 1. Inefficient `findDOMNode` usage
**Pass** - The code correctly identifies the inefficient use of `findDOMNode` and suggests using `refs` instead.

### 2. Avoid binding functions in render
**Pass** - The code correctly identifies the performance issue with binding functions in the `render` method and suggests using arrow functions instead.

## Accessibility
### 1. Missing `aria-*` attributes
**Pass** - The code correctly identifies the lack of `aria-*` attributes and suggests adding them for better accessibility.

### 2. Improve keyboard navigation
**Pass** - The code correctly identifies the need for `tabIndex` and `role` attributes to improve keyboard navigation.

## Best Practices
### 1. Use functional components where possible
**Pass** - The code correctly identifies the use of class components and suggests converting them to functional components for simplicity and better performance.

### 2. Avoid using `any` in TypeScript
**Pass** - The code correctly identifies the use of `any` and suggests using proper types instead.

## Testing
### 1. Lack of testable code structure
**Pass** - The code correctly identifies the lack of dependency injection and suggests abstracting dependencies for easier testing.

### 2. Add unit tests
**Pass** - The code correctly identifies the need for unit tests and suggests writing tests for critical methods.

## Documentation
### 1. Lack of comments for complex logic
**Pass** - The code correctly identifies the lack of comments and suggests adding comments to explain complex logic.
