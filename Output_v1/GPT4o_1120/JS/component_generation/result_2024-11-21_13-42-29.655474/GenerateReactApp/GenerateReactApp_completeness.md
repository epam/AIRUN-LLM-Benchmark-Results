# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Ensure that the API call to https://swapi.dev/api/people is made using axios.**
    - **Pass**: The API call is correctly made using axios in `src/services/api.ts`.

2. **Make sure the data is fetched initially without any input fields.**
    - **Pass**: The data is fetched on component mount in `src/App.tsx` without any input fields.

3. **Ensure a loader or loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.**
    - **Pass**: The `Loader` component is displayed while data is being fetched, as seen in `src/App.tsx`.

4. **Verify that errors are logged to the console if the API call fails.**
    - **Fail**: There is no error handling in the `loadCharacters` function in `src/App.tsx`. Errors are not logged to the console if the API call fails.

5. **Ensure that the fetched characters are displayed in a list format.**
    - **Pass**: The fetched characters are displayed in a list format using the `CharacterList` component in `src/components/CharacterList.tsx`.

6. **Make sure each list item has a unique key derived from the character URL.**
    - **Pass**: Each list item has a unique key derived from the character URL in `src/components/CharacterList.tsx`.

### Summary

- **Total number of steps evaluated**: 6
- **Number of passed steps**: 5
- **Number of failed steps**: 1

### Conclusion

The implementation is mostly correct, but it lacks error handling for the API call. Adding error handling to log errors to the console would make the implementation complete.
