# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
- **Pass**: The `TodoApp` component includes an input field with the class `new-todo`. The `handleAddTodo` function handles the `onKeyDown` event, checking for the Enter key and dispatching the `addTodo` action with the input value.

### Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
- **Pass**: The `TodoApp` component filters the todos based on the current filter state and passes the filtered todos to the `TodoList` component, which renders the list of `TodoItem` components.

### Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
- **Pass**: The `TodoApp` component includes a checkbox with the class `toggle-all`. The `onChange` event of this checkbox dispatches the `toggleAll` action with the checked status.

### Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItem` component includes a checkbox for toggling the completion status, a label for editing on double-click, and a button for deleting the todo. The corresponding actions (`toggleTodo`, `editTodo`, `deleteTodo`) are dispatched appropriately.

### Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItem` component handles double-clicking the label to start editing, pressing Enter to save changes, and resetting the edit state on blur or pressing Esc.

### Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFooter` component displays the count of active items, includes filter links for 'all', 'active', and 'completed', and a button to clear completed items. The corresponding actions (`setFilter`, `clearCompleted`) are dispatched appropriately.

### Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFooter` component includes a button with the class `clear-completed` that dispatches the `clearCompleted` action when clicked.
