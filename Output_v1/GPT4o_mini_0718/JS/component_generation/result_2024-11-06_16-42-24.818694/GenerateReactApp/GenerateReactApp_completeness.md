# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Ensure that the API call to https://swapi.dev/api/people is made using axios.
**Pass**
- The code uses `axios.get('https://swapi.dev/api/people')` to fetch data from the SWAPI API.

### Step 2: Make sure the data is fetched initially without any input fields.
**Pass**
- The data is fetched in the `useEffect` hook which runs on component mount, ensuring the data is fetched initially without any input fields.

### Step 3: Ensure a loader or loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass**
- The code uses a `loading` state to conditionally render a loading message: `{loading ? (<div>Loading...</div>) : (<ul>...</ul>)}`.

### Step 4: Verify that errors are logged to the console if the API call fails.
**Pass**
- The code catches errors in the `try...catch` block and logs them using `console.error(error)`.

### Step 5: Ensure that the fetched characters are displayed in a list format.
**Pass**
- The fetched characters are displayed in a list format using `<ul>` and `<li>` elements.

### Step 6: Make sure each list item has a unique key derived from the character URL.
**Pass**
- Each list item has a unique key derived from the character URL: `<li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>`.
