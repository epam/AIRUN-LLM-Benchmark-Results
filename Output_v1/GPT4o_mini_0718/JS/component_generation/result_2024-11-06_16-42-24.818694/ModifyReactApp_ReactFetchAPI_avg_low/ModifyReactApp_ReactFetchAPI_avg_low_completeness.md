# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that a loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass** - The code includes a loading state (`loading`) and displays "Loading..." when `loading` is true.

### Step 2: Verify that the loader does not hide the search input when data is loading.
**Pass** - The search input is always rendered regardless of the loading state.

### Step 3: Validate that a request with an empty search term is sent on the initial render.
**Pass** - The `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array calls `fetchCharacters('')` on initial render.

### Step 4: Verify that the search input field is present.
**Pass** - The search input field is present in the JSX with the placeholder "Search characters...".

### Step 5: Ensure that the character search functionality is implemented.
**Pass** - The search functionality is implemented using the `searchTerm` state and `fetchCharacters` function.

### Step 6: Ensure that the API request includes the search term as a query parameter.
**Pass** - The `fetchCharacters` function includes the search term as a query parameter in the API request.

### Step 7: Validate that the data is loading on initial app load with empty query and then when the search term changes.
**Pass** - The `useEffect` hooks ensure data is fetched on initial load and when the search term changes.

### Step 8: Ensure that the debounced fetch function prevents unnecessary API requests.
**Pass** - The `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout` in the `useEffect` hook debounce the API requests.

### Step 9: Confirm that the character list is updated based on the search results.
**Pass** - The character list is updated by setting the `characters` state with the fetched data.

### Step 10: Validate that the application handles API request errors.
**Pass** - The `fetchCharacters` function includes a try-catch block to handle API request errors.

### Step 11: Ensure that the user experience remains smooth without backend overloads.
**Pass** - The debouncing mechanism ensures that the backend is not overloaded with unnecessary requests.
