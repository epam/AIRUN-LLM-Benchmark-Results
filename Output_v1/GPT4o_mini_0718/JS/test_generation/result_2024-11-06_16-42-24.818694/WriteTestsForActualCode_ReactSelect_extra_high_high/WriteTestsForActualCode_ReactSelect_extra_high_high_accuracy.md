# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that the tests are isolated and do not depend on each other.
**Pass**: Each test is independent and does not rely on the state or outcome of other tests. The `beforeEach` function ensures that mocks are cleared before each test.

### Step 2: Validate that the tests adhere to best practices for unit testing.
**Pass**: The tests follow best practices by being specific, isolated, and using descriptive names. They test one thing at a time and use mocks where necessary.

### Step 3: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
**Pass**: The code does not contain any unnecessary duplicates. The `defaultProps` object is used to avoid repetition.

### Step 4: Ensure that the test suite achieves at least 80% code coverage for the Select component.
**Fail**: The provided code does not include a code coverage report. Without this report, it is not possible to confirm if the test suite achieves at least 80% code coverage.

### Step 5: Confirm that there are no TODO comments in the generated test code.
**Pass**: There are no TODO comments in the test code.

### Step 6: Check that mocking is used for dependencies where necessary using jest.fn().
**Pass**: Mocking is used appropriately with `jest.fn()` for the `onChange` handler.

### Step 7: Verify that the testing environment setup code is included.
**Pass**: The `beforeEach` function is used to clear mocks, which is part of the testing environment setup.

### Step 8: Confirm that the testing environment setup code uses Jest and React Testing Library.
**Pass**: The code uses Jest and React Testing Library for testing.

### Step 9: Ensure that the test file imports necessary modules such as React, Jest, React Testing Library, and the Select component.
**Pass**: The test file imports React, Jest, React Testing Library, and the Select component.

### Step 10: Verify that default props for the Select component are defined in the test file.
**Pass**: Default props for the Select component are defined in the `defaultProps` object.

### Step 11: Check that the default props include all necessary properties for the Select component.
**Pass**: The default props include all necessary properties for the Select component.

### Step 12: Verify that the testing libraries are chosen appropriately.
**Pass**: The testing libraries (Jest and React Testing Library) are appropriate for testing React components.

### Step 13: Ensure the testing environment is set up correctly.
**Pass**: The testing environment is set up correctly with Jest and React Testing Library.
