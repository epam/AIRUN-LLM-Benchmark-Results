# Evaluation Report

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Confirm that the application initializes correctly and loads persisted todos.**
   - **Pass**: The application initializes correctly with the provided `AppModule` and `AppComponent`. The `TodoEffects` class includes a placeholder for loading persisted todos, although the actual loading logic is not implemented.

2. **Ensure that the todo list displays correctly and is interactive.**
   - **Pass**: The `TodoComponent` uses Angular's template syntax to display the todo list. The list is interactive, allowing for adding, removing, and toggling todos.

3. **Verify that adding a new todo works correctly.**
   - **Pass**: The `addTodo` method in `TodoComponent` dispatches the `addTodo` action, which is handled by the `todoReducer` to add a new todo to the state.

4. **Check that editing a todo works correctly.**
   - **Fail**: The provided code does not include functionality for editing an existing todo item.

5. **Confirm that toggling a todo item’s completion status works correctly.**
   - **Fail**: The `toggle` checkbox in the template is bound to the `completed` property of the todo, but there is no action or reducer logic to handle the change in completion status.

6. **Ensure that removing a todo works correctly.**
   - **Pass**: The `removeTodo` method in `TodoComponent` dispatches the `removeTodo` action, which is handled by the `todoReducer` to remove the specified todo from the state.

7. **Verify that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works.**
   - **Pass**: The `markAll` method in `TodoComponent` dispatches the `markAll` action, which is handled by the `todoReducer` to mark all todos as completed or not completed.

8. **Check that the filter functionality (All, Active, Completed) works.**
   - **Fail**: The provided code does not include any filter functionality for displaying all, active, or completed todos.

9. **Confirm that the "Clear completed" button works correctly.**
   - **Pass**: The `clearCompleted` method in `TodoComponent` dispatches the `clearCompleted` action, which is handled by the `todoReducer` to remove all completed todos from the state.

10. **Ensure that the application is responsive and functions correctly on different screen sizes.**
    - **Pass**: The provided CSS file (`todo.component.css`) is empty, but the HTML structure follows the TodoMVC conventions, which are generally responsive. However, without specific styles, this cannot be fully confirmed.

### Summary

- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 10
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 7
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 3

### Conclusion

The provided code covers most of the basic functionalities of a TodoMVC application but lacks some critical features such as editing todos, toggling completion status, and filtering todos. Additionally, the application’s responsiveness cannot be fully confirmed without specific styles.
