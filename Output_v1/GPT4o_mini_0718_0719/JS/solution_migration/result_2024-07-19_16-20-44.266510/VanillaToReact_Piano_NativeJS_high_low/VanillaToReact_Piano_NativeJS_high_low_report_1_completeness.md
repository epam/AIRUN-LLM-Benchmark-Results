# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps:

1. **Verify the application contains a button container with "Notes" and "Letters" buttons.**
    - **Pass**: The application includes a button container with "Notes" and "Letters" buttons in the `App.tsx` file.

2. **Verify the application renders piano keys for both natural and sharp notes.**
    - **Pass**: The application renders piano keys for both natural and sharp notes. Natural notes are rendered using the `['D', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'J', 'K', 'L']` array, and sharp notes are rendered using the `['R', 'T', 'U', 'I', 'O']` array.

3. **Verify clicking on a piano key plays the correct sound and highlights the key.**
    - **Pass**: The `handleMouseDown` function plays the correct sound when a piano key is clicked, and the `played` state is updated to highlight the key.

4. **Verify releasing the mouse button or moving the cursor out of the key stops the sound and removes the highlight.**
    - **Pass**: The `handleMouseUp` function stops the sound and removes the highlight by updating the `played` state.

5. **Verify pressing and releasing keyboard keys play and stop the corresponding piano notes.**
    - **Pass**: The `handleKeyDown` and `handleKeyUp` functions handle keyboard events to play and stop the corresponding piano notes.

6. **Verify clicking the "Notes" button displays note names on the keys.**
    - **Pass**: Clicking the "Notes" button sets `isLetters` to `false`, which affects the class of the piano keys to display note names.

7. **Verify clicking the "Letters" button displays letter names on the keys.**
    - **Pass**: Clicking the "Letters" button sets `isLetters` to `true`, which affects the class of the piano keys to display letter names.

8. **Verify the fullscreen button toggles fullscreen mode for the application.**
    - **Pass**: The `toggleFullscreen` function toggles fullscreen mode for the application.

9. **Verify the application correctly handles simultaneous multiple key presses.**
    - **Pass**: The application correctly handles simultaneous multiple key presses by allowing multiple notes to be played and stopped independently.
