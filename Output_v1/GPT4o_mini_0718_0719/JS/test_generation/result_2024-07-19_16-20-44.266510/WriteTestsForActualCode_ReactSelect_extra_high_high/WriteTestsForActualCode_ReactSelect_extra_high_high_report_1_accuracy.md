# Evaluation Report

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Check that the tests are isolated and do not depend on each other.**
   - **Pass**: Each test case is independent and does not rely on the state or outcome of other tests.

2. **Validate that the tests adhere to best practices for unit testing.**
   - **Pass**: The tests are well-structured, focus on single functionalities, and use appropriate assertions.

3. **Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.**
   - **Pass**: The code avoids duplication by using `defaultProps` and reusing it across multiple tests.

4. **Ensure that the test suite achieves at least 80% code coverage for the Select component.**
   - **Fail**: The provided code does not include a coverage report, so it's not possible to confirm the coverage percentage.

5. **Confirm that there are no TODO comments in the generated test code.**
   - **Pass**: There are no TODO comments in the test code.

6. **Check that mocking is used for dependencies where necessary using jest.fn().**
   - **Pass**: Mocking is appropriately used for `onChange` and `onInputChange` using `jest.fn()`.

7. **Verify that the testing environment setup code is included.**
   - **Pass**: The setup code includes necessary imports and configurations.

8. **Confirm that the testing environment setup code uses Jest and React Testing Library.**
   - **Pass**: The setup code uses Jest and React Testing Library as indicated by the imports.

9. **Ensure that the test file imports necessary modules such as React, Jest, React Testing Library, and the Select component.**
   - **Pass**: The test file imports React, Jest, React Testing Library, and the Select component.

10. **Verify that default props for the Select component are defined in the test file.**
    - **Pass**: Default props are defined in the `defaultProps` object.

11. **Check that the default props include all necessary properties for the Select component.**
    - **Pass**: The `defaultProps` object includes all necessary properties for the Select component.

12. **Verify that the testing libraries are chosen appropriately.**
    - **Pass**: The chosen libraries (Jest and React Testing Library) are appropriate for testing React components.

13. **Ensure the testing environment is set up correctly.**
    - **Pass**: The testing environment is correctly set up with necessary configurations and imports.
