# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Check that the tests are isolated and do not depend on each other.**
   - **Pass**: Each test case is independent and does not rely on the outcome of other tests.

2. **Validate that the tests adhere to best practices for unit testing.**
   - **Pass**: The tests are well-structured, focusing on individual components and their functionalities.

3. **Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.**
   - **Pass**: The code does not contain any noticeable duplications and adheres to the DRY principle.

4. **Verify that the testing environment is set up correctly.**
   - **Pass**: The setup functions are correctly defined to initialize the components for testing.

5. **Check if a testing library for JavaScript (such as Jest) has been chosen.**
   - **Pass**: Jest is used as the testing library, as indicated by the `jest.mock` and `expect` statements.

6. **Validate that dependencies are mocked where necessary, such as API calls.**
   - **Pass**: The API calls are mocked using `jest.mock('../api')`.

7. **Verify that the test coverage for the code is at least 80%.**
   - **Fail**: The provided code does not include any information about test coverage. This needs to be verified separately.

8. **Confirm that the package.json file includes necessary dependencies and scripts for running tests.**
   - **Fail**: The provided code does not include the `package.json` file. This needs to be checked separately.

9. **Confirm that the tests use the proper methods and assertions from the chosen testing library.**
   - **Pass**: The tests use appropriate methods and assertions from Jest, such as `expect`, `toBe`, and `mockResolvedValue`.

### Summary

- **Total number of steps evaluated**: 9
- **Number of passed steps**: 7
- **Number of failed steps**: 2

The evaluation indicates that the majority of the steps have passed, but there are two critical areas that need attention: verifying test coverage and ensuring the `package.json` file includes necessary dependencies and scripts for running tests.
