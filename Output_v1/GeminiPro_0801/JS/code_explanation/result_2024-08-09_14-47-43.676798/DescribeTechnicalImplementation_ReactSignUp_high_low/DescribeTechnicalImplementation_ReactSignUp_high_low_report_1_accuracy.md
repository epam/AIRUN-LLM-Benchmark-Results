## Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Pass:** Check that the documentation maintains consistent formatting, terminology, and style throughout.
    - The documentation maintains a consistent format with clear headings and bullet points.
    - Terminology and style are consistent, using professional language.

2. **Pass:** Ensure the language is clear, professional, and free of ambiguous statements.
    - The language used is clear and professional.
    - There are no ambiguous statements; each feature and prop is described concisely.

3. **Fail:** Verify that all code snippets provided in the usage examples are accurate and functional based on the original code.
    - There are no code snippets provided in the documentation. This step cannot be evaluated as it is missing.

4. **Fail:** Ensure that the prop types listed in the documentation match those defined in the original code's PropTypes.
    - The documentation mentions that the `Signup` component does not accept any custom props but does not list the props passed by `reduxForm`.
    - The prop types are not explicitly listed, making it impossible to verify against the original code's PropTypes.
