# Evaluation Report

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Pass**: Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.
   - All imports (`React`, `useEffect`, `useState`, `axios`) are used in the code.

2. **Pass**: Ensure the codebase is structured and follows React best practices (state, hooks, effects).
   - The code uses `useState` for managing state and `useEffect` for side effects, following React best practices.

3. **Pass**: Check that a debounced function is used to optimize the search requests.
   - A `setTimeout` with a delay of 300ms is used to debounce the search requests.

4. **Pass**: Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.
   - The `clearTimeout` function is used to clean up the timeout, preventing memory leaks.

5. **Pass**: Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.
   - The code uses modern React hooks and TypeScript, ensuring compatibility with the latest versions.

6. **Pass**: Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.
   - There are no apparent console errors or warnings in the provided code.

7. **Pass**: Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.
   - The code uses React's state (`searchTerm`) to manage the input value.

8. **Pass**: Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React’s virtual DOM.
   - There is no direct DOM manipulation in the code.

9. **Pass**: Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React’s state and props.
   - The code does not use refs unnecessarily; it relies on state and props.

10. **Pass**: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
    - The code is concise and does not contain any duplicate logic.

11. **Pass**: Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.
    - The use of `useEffect` with dependencies ensures that re-renders are controlled.

12. **Pass**: Confirm that the useState is used to capture the search input value.
    - `useState` is used to capture and manage the `searchTerm`.

13. **Pass**: Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs.
    - There are no TODO comments in the code.

14. **Pass**: Verify the inclusion of TypeScript in the React application.
    - The code uses TypeScript interfaces and type annotations.

15. **Pass**: Ensure that `axios` is used for making API requests.
    - `axios` is used to make the API request to the Star Wars API.

16. **Pass**: Validate that the `useEffect` hooks are used correctly for data loading.
    - `useEffect` is correctly used to handle data fetching based on the `searchTerm`.
