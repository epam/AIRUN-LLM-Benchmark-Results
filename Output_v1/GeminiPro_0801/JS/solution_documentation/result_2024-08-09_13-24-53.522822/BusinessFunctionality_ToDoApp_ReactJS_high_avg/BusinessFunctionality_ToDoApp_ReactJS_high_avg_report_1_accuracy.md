# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### 1. Confirm that constraints related to local storage limitations are noted.
**Pass** - The report mentions that the application relies on `localStorage` for data persistence, which limits scalability and synchronization across devices.

### 2. Verify that assumptions about the application being designed for a single user are mentioned.
**Pass** - The report clearly states that the application is designed for a single user and does not include features for collaboration or user accounts.

### 3. Ensure that browser compatibility assumptions are included.
**Fail** - The report does not mention any assumptions or considerations regarding browser compatibility.

### 4. Check that performance-related constraints are noted.
**Pass** - The report discusses performance constraints, including the use of `localStorage` and the lack of a backend, which limit scalability.

### 5. Confirm that performance optimizations, such as the use of `shouldComponentUpdate`, are identified.
**Pass** - The report identifies the use of `shouldComponentUpdate` in the `TodoItem` component to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

### 6. Verify that considerations for using immutable data structures for performance are mentioned.
**Fail** - The report does not mention the use of immutable data structures for performance optimization.

### 7. Ensure scalability considerations related to local storage limitations are discussed.
**Pass** - The report discusses the limitations of using `localStorage` for scalability and mentions that it is not suitable for handling a large number of tasks or users.

### 8. Check that the potential need for a backend service for better scalability is mentioned.
**Pass** - The report mentions the lack of a backend and implies that this limits scalability, suggesting a potential need for a backend service.

### 9. Confirm that the evaluation steps are unambiguous and concise.
**Pass** - The evaluation steps are clear and concise, allowing for straightforward assessment.

### 10. Ensure that each step allows the evaluator to assess the output based solely on the provided code.
**Pass** - Each step is designed to be assessed based on the provided code and the analysis report.

### 11. Verify that the steps are clearly articulated and cover all main points of the task.
**Pass** - The steps are clearly articulated and cover the main points of the task, including functionality, user interaction, business objectives, constraints, performance, and scalability.
