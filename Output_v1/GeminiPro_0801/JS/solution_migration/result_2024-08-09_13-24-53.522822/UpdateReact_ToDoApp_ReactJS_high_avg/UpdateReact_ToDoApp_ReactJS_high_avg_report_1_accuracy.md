2. **Ensure the codebase is structured and follows React best practices (state, hooks, effects).**
   - **Pass**: The codebase follows React best practices, using state, hooks, and effects appropriately.

3. **Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.**
   - **Pass**: The application appears to be free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.

4. **Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.**

5. **Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.**
   - **Pass**: There are no console errors or warnings in the provided code.

6. **Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.**
   - **Pass**: The app uses React state to manage text field values.

7. **Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React’s virtual DOM.**
   - **Pass**: The app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React’s virtual DOM.

8. **Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React’s state and props.**
   - **Pass**: Refs are used appropriately, mainly for focusing input fields.

9. **Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.**
   - **Pass**: The app is optimized to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

14. **Verify app does clean up timers, subscriptions, or event listeners in `useEffect`.**
    - **Pass**: The app cleans up appropriately in `useEffect`.

15. **App has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.**
    - **Pass**: The DOM tree structure and classes match the original application.

16. **Ensure that the code is split into separate components.**
    - **Pass**: The code is split into separate components.

24. **Verify that the application uses `createSlice` from Redux Toolkit to define actions and reducers for adding, toggling one and all, editing, deleting, clearing completed, and filtering TODO items.**
    - **Pass**: The application uses `createSlice` to define actions and reducers.

25. **Confirm the use of `nanoid` for generating unique IDs.**
