# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
**Pass**: The `App.tsx` file contains an input field with the class `new-todo`. The `handleKeyDown` function checks for the Enter key and dispatches the `addTodo` action with the trimmed value from the state.

### Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
**Fail**: The provided code does not include the implementation of filtering functionality. The `TodoList.tsx` file displays all todos without any filtering logic.

### Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
**Pass**: The `App.tsx` file includes a checkbox with the class `toggle-all` and a corresponding `handleToggleAll` function that dispatches the `toggleAllTodos` action.

### Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
**Pass**: The `TodoItem.tsx` file includes functionality to toggle (`handleToggle`), edit (`handleEditChange`, `handleEditKeyDown`, `handleEditBlur`), and delete (`handleDestroy`) each todo item.

### Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
**Pass**: The `TodoItem.tsx` file includes a `handleEditStart` function that sets `isEditing` to true on double click. The `handleEditKeyDown` function handles Enter and Esc key events appropriately.

### Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
**Fail**: The `Footer.tsx` file displays the count of active items and includes a button to clear completed items, but the filter functionality is not implemented.

### Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
**Pass**: The `Footer.tsx` file includes a button with the class `clear-completed` that calls the `onClearCompleted` function, which dispatches the `clearCompletedTodos` action.
