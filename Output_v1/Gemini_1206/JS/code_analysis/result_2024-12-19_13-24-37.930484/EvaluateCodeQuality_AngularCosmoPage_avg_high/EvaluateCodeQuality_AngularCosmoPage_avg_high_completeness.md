# Evaluation Report

## Readability

### 1. Inconsistent Date Handling in `pageCtrl.js`
- **Pass**: The code handles dates inconsistently, mixing Unix timestamps and JavaScript `Date` objects. The suggested fix provides a consistent approach to handling dates.

### 2. Magic Strings in `page.html` and `pageCtrl.js`
- **Pass**: The code uses several "magic strings" throughout, making it harder to understand and maintain. The suggested fix replaces magic strings with constants, improving maintainability.

### 3. Long Method `savePage` in `pageCtrl.js`
- **Pass**: The `savePage` method is very long and handles multiple responsibilities. The suggested fix breaks it down into smaller, more manageable functions, improving readability and maintainability.

## Maintainability

### 1. Tight Coupling in `rest.js`
- **Pass**: The `REST` factory is tightly coupled with specific API endpoints and the `Page` factory. The suggested fix decouples the `REST` factory, improving maintainability.

### 2. Lack of Modularity in `pageCtrl.js`
- **Pass**: The `pageCtrl` controller is responsible for too many things. The suggested fix breaks it down into smaller, more focused services and controllers, improving maintainability and testability.

## Performance

### 1. Unnecessary Digest Cycles in `pageCtrl.js`
- **Pass**: The `titleChange`, `descriptionChange`, and `urlChange` functions manually update the `Page` factory's properties, which might trigger unnecessary digest cycles. The suggested fix relies on Angular's two-way data binding, reducing unnecessary digest cycles.

### 2. Excessive DOM Manipulation in `autocompleteTags`
- **Pass**: The `autocompleteTags` function queries the server for tag suggestions on every key press, leading to performance issues. The suggested fix implements debouncing, reducing the number of API calls.

## Accessibility

### 1. Missing ARIA Attributes in `page.html`
- **Pass**: The `page.html` template lacks ARIA attributes. The suggested fix adds ARIA attributes, improving accessibility.

### 2. Insufficient Contrast in `page.html`
- **Pass**: Some elements in `page.html` might have insufficient color contrast. The suggested fix ensures sufficient contrast, improving accessibility.

## Best Practices

### 1. Use of `$rootScope` for Event Broadcasting
- **Pass**: The code uses `$rootScope` to broadcast events, which can lead to performance issues. The suggested fix uses a dedicated service for event communication, improving performance and maintainability.

### 2. Direct DOM Manipulation in Controller
- **Pass**: The controller directly manipulates the DOM, which is generally discouraged in Angular. The suggested fix uses Angular's directives and data binding, improving maintainability.

## Testing

### 1. Lack of Unit Tests
- **Pass**: The provided code does not include any unit tests. The suggested fix provides example unit tests, improving code quality and correctness.

### 2. Difficult to Test `pageCtrl`
- **Pass**: The `pageCtrl` controller is difficult to test due to its tight coupling with other services. The suggested fix breaks down the controller into smaller services, making it easier to test.

## Documentation

### 1. Insufficient Comments in `pageCtrl.js`
- **Pass**: The `pageCtrl.js` file has some comments, but they are not comprehensive enough. The suggested fix adds detailed comments, improving readability and maintainability.

### 2. Lack of JSDoc in `rest.js`, `page.js`, and `users.js`
- **Pass**: The `rest.js`, `page.js`, and `users.js` files lack JSDoc-style comments. The suggested fix adds JSDoc comments, improving documentation and maintainability.
