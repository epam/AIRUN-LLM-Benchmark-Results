# Evaluation Report

## Readability

### 1. Unclear `asyncValidate` Function
- **Pass**: The `asyncValidate` function was refactored using `async/await` and broken down into smaller functions.

### 2. Implicit `this` Binding in `handleSubmit`
- **Pass**: The `handleSubmit` method was refactored to use arrow functions, eliminating the need for `this.handleSubmit.bind(this)`.

### 3. Magic Numbers in Validation
- **Pass**: Magic numbers were replaced with named constants for better readability.

## Maintainability

### 1. Duplicated Validation Logic
- **Pass**: The validation logic was refactored into reusable functions, as demonstrated in the `isNameAvailable` and `isEmailAvailable` functions.

### 2. Hardcoded API Calls in Component
- **Pass**: API calls were abstracted into separate services or actions, improving testability and reusability.

## Performance

### 1. Unnecessary Promise Creation in `handleSubmit`
- **Pass**: The `handleSubmit` method was refactored to directly return the Promise from `api.signup`.

## Accessibility

### 1. Missing Labels for Form Inputs
- **Pass**: Labels were added to form inputs to improve accessibility.

### 2. Lack of ARIA Attributes
- **Pass**: ARIA attributes were added to enhance accessibility, especially for error states.

## Best Practices

### 1. Using `PropTypes` Instead of TypeScript
- **Pass**: The code was migrated to TypeScript, providing static type checking and improving maintainability.

### 2. Inconsistent use of Bootstrap
- **Pass**: The code was refactored to consistently use `react-bootstrap` components.

## Testing

### 1. Difficult to Test `handleSubmit`
- **Pass**: The `handleSubmit` method was refactored to use Redux actions, making it easier to unit test.

### 2. Lack of Tests for Validation Functions
- **Pass**: Unit tests were added for the `validate` and `asyncValidate` functions.

## Documentation

### 1. Lack of Comments Explaining Complex Logic
- **Pass**: Comments were added to explain the purpose of complex code blocks.

### 2. Missing JSDoc for Functions
- **Pass**: JSDoc comments were added to functions, improving code understanding and maintainability.
