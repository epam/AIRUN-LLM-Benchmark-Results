# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Confirm the component includes a search feature in the dropdown.
**Pass**: The component includes an input field within the dropdown for searching options. This is evident from the `input` element with the class `select-search` and the `handleInputChange` function that updates the `searchTerm` state.

### Step 2: Check that the component is navigable via keyboard.
**Pass**: The component handles keyboard events such as `ArrowUp`, `ArrowDown`, `Enter`, and `Escape` in the `handleKeyDown` function, allowing navigation through the options using the keyboard.

### Step 3: Verify items in the dropdown can be selected by pressing the Enter key.
**Pass**: The `handleKeyDown` function includes logic to select an item when the `Enter` key is pressed, provided the dropdown is open and an item is highlighted.

### Step 4: Confirm the dropdown list opens when Enter is pressed.
**Pass**: The `handleKeyDown` function includes logic to open the dropdown when the `Enter` key is pressed and the dropdown is not already open.

### Step 5: Ensure the focus returns to the select component after the dropdown is closed.
**Pass**: The `handleSelect` and `handleKeyDown` functions both include logic to return focus to the `selectRef` when the dropdown is closed.

### Step 6: Verify the dropdown closes upon selecting an item via keyboard.
**Pass**: The `handleSelect` function sets `isOpen` to `false`, closing the dropdown when an item is selected via keyboard.

### Step 7: Verify the dropdown closes upon selecting an item via mouse.
**Pass**: The `handleSelect` function is called when an item is clicked, which sets `isOpen` to `false`, closing the dropdown.

### Step 8: Confirm the dropdown closes when the Escape key is pressed.
**Pass**: The `handleKeyDown` function includes logic to close the dropdown when the `Escape` key is pressed.

### Step 9: Ensure the dropdown closes when clicking outside the component.
**Pass**: The `handleBlur` function includes logic to close the dropdown when the focus is lost and the related target is not a child of the `selectRef`.
