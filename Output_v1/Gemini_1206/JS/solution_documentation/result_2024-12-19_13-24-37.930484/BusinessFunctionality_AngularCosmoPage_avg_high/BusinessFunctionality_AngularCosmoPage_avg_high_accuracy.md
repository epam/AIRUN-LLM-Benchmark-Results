# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps:

1. **Ensure that the application uses `$resource` objects for RESTful API communication.**
    - **Pass**: The code defines a factory `REST` that utilizes Angular's `$resource` to interact with a RESTful backend, providing methods to perform CRUD operations on various resources.

2. **Verify that the application saves page changes to local storage.**
    - **Pass**: The application manages local storage of unsaved changes, allowing users to revert to a locally stored version if there are unsaved changes.

3. **Confirm that the application initializes the page type correctly.**
    - **Pass**: The application allows users to select the page type from available theme pages, ensuring the page type is initialized correctly.

4. **Validate that the application manages local storage for unsaved changes.**
    - **Pass**: The application handles local storage for unsaved changes, providing functionality to revert to a locally stored version if necessary.

5. **Verify that the application handles errors during saving or updating pages.**
    - **Fail**: The provided code does not explicitly show error handling mechanisms for saving or updating pages.

6. **Confirm that the application broadcasts events to update page variables and settings when necessary.**
    - **Fail**: The provided code does not explicitly show broadcasting events to update page variables and settings.

7. **Validate that the application uses promises and callbacks for asynchronous operations.**
    - **Fail**: The provided code does not explicitly show the use of promises and callbacks for asynchronous operations.

8. **Validate that the application broadcasts notifications for various operations (e.g., page saving, updating, deleting).**
    - **Fail**: The provided code does not explicitly show broadcasting notifications for various operations.

9. **Verify that the application supports scalability and maintainability through modular design.**
    - **Pass**: The application uses a modular design, with separate files for RESTful API interaction, page management, and user management, supporting scalability and maintainability.

10. **Confirm that the application optimizes performance through efficient API usage and local storage management.**
    - **Pass**: The application uses Angular's `$resource` for efficient API interaction and manages local storage for unsaved changes, optimizing performance.

### Summary:

- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 10
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 6
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 4

Overall, the application demonstrates good practices in using `$resource` for RESTful API communication, managing local storage for unsaved changes, initializing page types, and supporting scalability and maintainability through modular design. However, it lacks explicit error handling, event broadcasting, and the use of promises and callbacks for asynchronous operations.
