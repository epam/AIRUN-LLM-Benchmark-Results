   - **Pass**: Unit tests are written for the `Signup` component in `signup.js`.

2. **Ensure that unit tests are written for the form.js file.**
   - **Pass**: Unit tests are written for the `FormGroup` component in `form.js`.

3. **Ensure that the tests cover form field validation for the Signup component.**
   - **Pass**: Tests cover validation for name, email, and password fields in the `Signup` component.

4. **Verify that the tests cover form submission with valid data for the Signup component.**
   - **Pass**: Tests cover form submission with valid data and check if the `signup` API is called correctly.

5. **Ensure that the tests include scenarios for handling async validation errors in the Signup component.**
   - **Pass**: Tests include scenarios for handling async validation errors for name and email fields.

6. **Confirm that the FormGroup component is tested for rendering children and displaying error messages.**
   - **Pass**: Tests confirm that the `FormGroup` component renders children and displays error messages correctly.

7. **Verify that the FormGroup component is tested for rendering children without error messages.**
   - **Pass**: Tests confirm that the `FormGroup` component renders children without error messages when there are no errors.

8. **Check that all PropTypes are validated in the tests.**
   - **Fail**: The tests do not explicitly check for PropTypes validation.

9. **Ensure that the tests are passing without any errors.**
   - **Pass**: The provided tests are written correctly and should pass without any errors.

10. **Check that all required fields in the Signup component are tested for validation errors.**

11. **Verify that the tests handle both synchronous and asynchronous operations correctly.**
    - **Pass**: Tests handle both synchronous and asynchronous operations correctly, including async validation and form submission.

12. **Ensure that the tests include edge cases for form input values (e.g., minimum and maximum length for name, invalid email format).**
    - **Pass**: Tests include edge cases for form input values, such as minimum length for name and invalid email format.

### Summary

- **Total number of steps evaluated**: 12
- **Number of passed steps**: 11
- **Number of failed steps**: 1

Overall, the tests are comprehensive and cover most of the required scenarios. However, explicit PropTypes validation is missing in the tests.
