# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that a loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass** - The code includes a loading state (`loading`) and displays "Loading..." when `loading` is true.

### Step 2: Verify that the loader does not hide the search input when data is loading.
**Pass** - The search input is always rendered regardless of the loading state.

### Step 3: Validate that a request with an empty search term is sent on the initial render.
**Pass** - On initial render, `searchTerm` is an empty string, and a request is sent to `https://swapi.dev/api/people/?search=`.

### Step 4: Verify that the search input field is present.
**Pass** - The search input field is present in the JSX (`<input type="text" value={searchTerm} onChange={handleSearchChange} />`).

### Step 5: Ensure that the character search functionality is implemented.
**Pass** - The search functionality is implemented by updating `searchTerm` and making an API request with the search term.

### Step 6: Ensure that the API request includes the search term as a query parameter.
**Pass** - The API request URL includes the search term as a query parameter (`https://swapi.dev/api/people/?search=${searchTerm}`).

### Step 7: Validate that the data is loading on initial app load with empty query and then when the search term changes.
**Pass** - The data is loaded on initial app load with an empty query and when the search term changes due to the `useEffect` dependency on `searchTerm`.

### Step 8: Ensure that the debounced fetch function prevents unnecessary API requests.
**Pass** - The fetch function is debounced using `setTimeout` with a 300ms delay, and the timeout is cleared on cleanup.

### Step 9: Confirm that the character list is updated based on the search results.
**Pass** - The character list is updated based on the search results by setting `characters` state with the response data.

### Step 10: Validate that the application handles API request errors.
**Pass** - The application handles API request errors by catching the error and logging it to the console.

### Step 11: Ensure that the user experience remains smooth without backend overloads.
**Pass** - The debounced fetch function and loading indicator ensure a smooth user experience without backend overloads.
