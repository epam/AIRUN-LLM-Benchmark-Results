# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Confirm that constraints related to local storage limitations are noted.
**Pass** - The analysis mentions that scalability is limited by the browser's local storage capacity and that a very large number of todos could potentially exceed this limit.

### Step 2: Verify that assumptions about the application being designed for a single user are mentioned.
**Pass** - The analysis clearly states that the application is designed for a single user and doesn't support sharing or collaboration.

### Step 3: Ensure that browser compatibility assumptions are included.
**Pass** - The analysis includes a note about the code assuming a modern browser environment that supports the features used in the code, and mentions that older browsers might require polyfills.

### Step 4: Check that performance-related constraints are noted.
**Pass** - The analysis discusses performance constraints, including the potential bottleneck of the external routing library and the limitations of local storage.

### Step 5: Confirm that performance optimizations, such as the use of `shouldComponentUpdate`, are identified.
**Pass** - The analysis identifies the use of `shouldComponentUpdate` in the `TodoItem` component to minimize unnecessary re-renders and improve performance.

### Step 6: Verify that considerations for using immutable data structures for performance are mentioned.
**Pass** - The analysis mentions that the code generally follows immutability principles when updating the todo list, which can improve performance and make the code easier to reason about.

### Step 7: Ensure scalability considerations related to local storage limitations are discussed.
**Pass** - The analysis discusses the limitations of local storage for scalability and mentions that a server-side solution with a database would be necessary for better scalability.

### Step 8: Check that the potential need for a backend service for better scalability is mentioned.
**Pass** - The analysis mentions that a server-side solution with a database would be necessary for better scalability.

### Step 9: Confirm that the evaluation steps are unambiguous and concise.
**Pass** - The evaluation steps are clear, concise, and unambiguous, allowing the evaluator to assess the output based solely on the provided code.

### Step 10: Ensure that each step allows the evaluator to assess the output based solely on the provided code.
**Pass** - Each step is designed to allow the evaluator to assess the output based solely on the provided code.

### Step 11: Verify that the steps are clearly articulated and cover all main points of the task.
**Pass** - The steps are clearly articulated and cover all the main points of the task, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation.
