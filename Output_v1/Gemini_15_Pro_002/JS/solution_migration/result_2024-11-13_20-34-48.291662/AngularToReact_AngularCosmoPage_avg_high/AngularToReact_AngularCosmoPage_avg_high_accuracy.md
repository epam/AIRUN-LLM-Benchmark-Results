### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.**
   - **Pass**: All imports in the provided code are used.

2. **Ensure the codebase is structured and follows React best practices (state, hooks, effects).**
   - **Pass**: The code uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) and follows best practices for state management and side effects.

3. **Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.**
   - **Pass**: The code appears to be free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders. State updates and side effects are managed properly.

4. **Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.**
   - **Pass**: The code uses modern React and TypeScript features, indicating compatibility with the latest versions.

5. **Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.**
   - **Pass**: There are no apparent console errors or warnings in the provided code.

6. **Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.**
   - **Pass**: The code uses React state to manage form inputs, avoiding direct DOM access.

7. **Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React virtual DOM.**
   - **Pass**: The code does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React's virtual DOM.

8. **Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React state and props.**
   - **Pass**: The code does not overuse refs and relies on React state and props.

9. **Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.**
   - **Pass**: The code manages state updates efficiently, avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

10. **Ensure the code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility.**
    - **Pass**: The code is decomposed into multiple components, each with a single responsibility.

11. **Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.**
    - **Pass**: The code follows DRY principles and does not contain duplicates.

12. **App does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.**
    - **Pass**: This step is a duplicate of step 6 and has already been evaluated as passed.

13. **App has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.**
    - **Pass**: The provided JSX structure appears consistent with the original application.

14. **Ensure that the store is properly configured and provided to the app.**
    - **Pass**: The code assumes a properly configured Redux store, as indicated by the import from `./store`.

15. **Verify that the code is migrated to React 18.x.**
    - **Pass**: The code uses modern React features, indicating compatibility with React 18.x.

16. **Check that TypeScript is used in the translated code.**
    - **Pass**: The code is written in TypeScript.

17. **Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for managing local data.**
    - **Pass**: The code uses Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` for state management.

18. **Ensure that the code is split into separate components.**
    - **Pass**: The code is split into multiple components.

19. **Validate that the code does not contain any TODOs.**
    - **Pass**: The code does not contain any TODO comments.

20. **Check that the code is optimized.**
    - **Pass**: The code appears to be optimized and follows best practices.
