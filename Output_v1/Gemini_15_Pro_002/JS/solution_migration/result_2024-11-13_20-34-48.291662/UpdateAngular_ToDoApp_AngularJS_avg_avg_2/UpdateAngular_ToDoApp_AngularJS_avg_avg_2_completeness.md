# Evaluation Report

## Step 1: Confirm that the application initializes correctly and loads persisted todos.
- **Pass**: The application initializes correctly with the provided `AppModule` and `AppComponent`. The `StoreModule` and `EffectsModule` are properly configured to manage the state and side effects.

## Step 2: Ensure that the todo list displays correctly and is interactive.
- **Pass**: The `AppComponent` subscribes to the `todos` state and passes it to the `TodoComponent`, which displays the list of todos. The `TodoComponent` is interactive, allowing for editing, toggling, and removing todos.

## Step 3: Verify that adding a new todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoHeaderComponent` has an `addTodo` method that dispatches the `addTodo` action with the new todo title. The `todoReducer` handles this action and adds the new todo to the state.

## Step 4: Check that editing a todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoComponent` has methods for editing (`editTodo`), done editing (`doneEditing`), and updating (`updateTodo`). The `todoReducer` handles the `updateTodo` action to update the todo in the state.

## Step 5: Confirm that toggling a todo item completion status works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoComponent` has a `toggleCompleted` method that dispatches the `toggleCompleted` action. The `todoReducer` handles this action to toggle the completion status of the todo.

## Step 6: Ensure that removing a todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoComponent` has a `removeTodo` method that dispatches the `removeTodo` action. The `todoReducer` handles this action to remove the todo from the state.

## Step 7: Verify that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFooterComponent` has a `markAll` method that dispatches the `markAll` action. The `todoReducer` handles this action to mark all todos as completed or not completed.

## Step 8: Check that the filter functionality (All, Active, Completed) works.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include any implementation for filtering todos based on their status (All, Active, Completed). This functionality is missing.

## Step 9: Confirm that the "Clear completed" button works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFooterComponent` has a `clearCompleted` method that dispatches the `clearCompleted` action. The `todoReducer` handles this action to remove all completed todos from the state.

## Step 10: Ensure that the application is responsive and functions correctly on different screen sizes.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include any CSS or responsive design implementation to ensure the application functions correctly on different screen sizes. This aspect is not addressed.

## Summary

- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 10

Overall, the application is mostly functional with the core features implemented correctly. However, it lacks the filter functionality and responsive design, which are essential for a complete and user-friendly todo application.
