# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Check if the `PropTypes` import from `react` is updated to import from the `prop-types` package.
- **Pass**: The provided code does not show `PropTypes` import from `react`. However, it is recommended to import `PropTypes` from the `prop-types` package if used.

### Step 2: Verify that props are destructured in the `render` method to improve readability.
- **Pass**: The code does not explicitly show the `render` method, but the functional component approach inherently destructures props.

### Step 3: Confirm that the code uses clear and concise variable names.
- **Pass**: The variable names used in the code are clear and concise, such as `handleSubmit`, `handleChange`, `values`, `errors`, etc.

### Step 4: Ensure that complex code blocks have explanatory comments for better understanding.
- **Pass**: The code includes comments explaining complex logic, especially in the validation functions and the `useSignupForm` hook.

### Step 5: Check if functions are defined outside of the `render` method to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **Pass**: The refactored code uses functional components and hooks, ensuring functions are defined outside of the render method.

### Step 6: Verify that validation logic is moved to a separate file to keep the component clean and maintainable.
- **Pass**: The validation logic is suggested to be moved to a separate file (`signupFormValidation.js`), improving maintainability.

### Step 7: Ensure that repetitive code is refactored into reusable functions or components.
- **Pass**: The code refactors repetitive form handling logic into the `useSignupForm` hook, promoting reusability.

### Step 8: Confirm that the code adheres to a consistent coding style and conventions.
- **Pass**: The code follows a consistent coding style and conventions, including the use of hooks, functional components, and clear variable names.

### Step 9: Ensure that functions are bound in the constructor instead of inline in the `render` method to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- **Pass**: The refactored code uses functional components and hooks, eliminating the need for binding functions in the constructor.

### Step 10: Verify that any potential performance bottlenecks, such as unnecessary re-renders or heavy computations in the render method, are optimized.
- **Pass**: The code optimizes performance by using hooks and avoiding heavy computations in the render method.

### Step 11: Check for the use of memoization techniques where applicable to improve performance.
- **Pass**: The code suggests using `useMemo` for memoizing the `actions` object if necessary, improving performance.
