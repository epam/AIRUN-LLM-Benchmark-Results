# Evaluation Report

## Readability

### 1. Verbose `setState` in `componentDidMount` for Router
- **Pass**: The use of arrow functions instead of `setState.bind` improves readability and conciseness.

### 2. `ReactDOM.findDOMNode` for input value access
- **Pass**: Replacing `ReactDOM.findDOMNode` with `React.createRef()` and using refs in a more React-idiomatic way improves readability and maintainability.

### 3. `Utils.extend` can be replaced with object spread syntax
- **Pass**: Replacing the custom `Utils.extend` function with the object spread syntax improves readability and leverages native JavaScript features.

## Maintainability

### 1. String Refs are deprecated
- **Pass**: Replacing string refs with `React.createRef()` improves type safety and follows modern React best practices.

### 2. Basic Router Implementation
- **Pass**: Suggesting the use of `react-router-dom` for routing improves maintainability and scalability of the application.

### 3. Class Components for Simple UI
- **Pass**: Converting simple class components to functional components with hooks improves readability and maintainability.

## Performance

### 1. Binding in `render` method
- **Pass**: Using class property arrow functions for event handlers avoids unnecessary function re-creation and improves performance.

## Accessibility

### 1. Missing `htmlFor` attribute in labels
- **Pass**: Ensuring labels use the `htmlFor` attribute to link to input elements improves accessibility.

### 2. `href="#"` for navigation
- **Pass**: Replacing `href="#"` with `react-router-dom`'s `<Link>` component improves accessibility and follows best practices for single-page applications.

## Best Practices

### 1. Usage of `var` keyword
- **Pass**: Replacing `var` with `const` and `let` improves code clarity and reduces the risk of scope-related errors.

### 2. Lack of Type Safety for Event Handlers
- **Pass**: Using more specific event types improves type safety and reduces the need for `any` casting.

## Testing

### 1. Testability of Class Components
- **Pass**: Suggesting the use of functional components with hooks for simpler UI logic improves testability.

### 2. Lack of Unit Tests
- **Pass**: Emphasizing the importance of unit tests and providing examples for `TodoModel` improves code quality and maintainability.

## Documentation

### 1. Good Comments in Code
- **Pass**: The existing comments are helpful and should be continued to explain complex logic and non-obvious code sections.

### 2. Missing Component and Prop Descriptions
- **Pass**: Adding JSDoc-style comments for components and props provides a structured way to document the component's purpose, props, and methods.
