# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
- **Pass**: The `TodoApp` component includes an input field with a `handleNewTodoKeyDown` function that listens for the Enter key and dispatches the `addTodo` action with the input value.

### Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
- **Pass**: The `TodoApp` component filters the todos based on the `nowShowing` state and displays them in a list using the `shownTodos` variable.

### Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
- **Pass**: The `TodoApp` component includes a checkbox with an `onChange` handler (`handleToggleAll`) that dispatches the `toggleAllTodos` action.

### Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItem` component includes handlers for toggling (`handleToggle`), editing (`handleEdit`), and deleting (`handleDestroy`) a todo item, each dispatching the corresponding actions.

### Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItem` component includes a `handleEdit` function that sets the editing state on double click, a `handleKeyDown` function that handles Enter and Esc keys, and a `handleSubmit` function that updates the todo title.

### Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFooter` component displays the count of active items, includes filter links that dispatch the `setNowShowing` action, and a button to clear completed items that dispatches the `clearCompletedTodos` action.

### Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFooter` component includes a "Clear completed" button that dispatches the `clearCompletedTodos` action when clicked.
