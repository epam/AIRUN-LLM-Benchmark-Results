# Evaluation Report

## Readability

### 1. Inconsistent Date Handling in `pageCtrl.js`
- **Pass**: The code identifies inconsistent date handling and provides a clear, improved solution using JavaScript `Date` objects consistently.

### 2. Deeply Nested Callbacks in `savePage`
- **Pass**: The code identifies deeply nested callbacks and provides an improved solution using `async/await` for better readability and structure.

### 3. Magic Strings in `pageCtrl.js` and `page.html`
- **Pass**: The code identifies the use of magic strings and suggests defining constants in a central location for better maintainability.

### 4. Unclear Logic in `autocompleteTags`
- **Pass**: The code identifies unclear logic and provides a more descriptive function name and comments for better readability.

## Maintainability

### 1. `Page` Factory is a Data Dump
- **Pass**: The code identifies the issue of the `Page` factory being a global data store and suggests a more structured approach with methods for managing page data.

### 2. `Users` Factory is Also a Data Dump
- **Pass**: The code identifies the issue of the `Users` factory being a global data store and suggests a more structured approach with methods for managing user data.

### 3. Tight Coupling with `$rootScope`
- **Pass**: The code identifies tight coupling with `$rootScope` and suggests using a dedicated service for application-wide events or notifications.

### 4. Direct DOM Manipulation
- **Pass**: The code identifies the use of `ng-show` and `ng-class` and suggests keeping the logic simple and using computed properties or helper functions.

## Performance

### 1. Excessive `$watch` Implicitly Created
- **Pass**: The code identifies excessive watchers and suggests using one-time binding, `ng-model-options` with `debounce`, and `track by` with `ng-repeat` for better performance.

### 2. Unnecessary API Calls in `deletePage`
- **Pass**: The code identifies unnecessary API calls and suggests using `$q.all` or `Promise.all` with `async/await` to execute delete requests in parallel.

## Accessibility

### 1. Missing ARIA Attributes and Semantic HTML
- **Pass**: The code identifies missing ARIA attributes and semantic HTML elements and suggests improvements for better accessibility.
