### Step 3: Confirm that variable and function names are descriptive and meaningful.
- **Pass**: Variable and function names are descriptive and meaningful in the refactored code.

### Step 4: Look for consistent use of whitespace and indentation.
- **Pass**: The refactored code maintains consistent use of whitespace and indentation.

### Step 5: Ensure large methods are broken down into smaller, more manageable methods.
- **Pass**: Large methods are broken down into smaller, more manageable methods in the refactored code.

### Step 6: Verify that inline event handlers are moved to class methods.
