# Evaluation Report

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.**
   - **Pass**: The provided code does not contain any unused imports or code.

2. **Ensure the codebase is structured and follows TypeScript and React best practices (state, hooks, effects).**
   - **Pass**: The code uses TypeScript interfaces, React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), and follows best practices.

3. **Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.**
   - **Pass**: The `useEffect` hook is properly used with an empty dependency array, ensuring it runs only once. There are no indications of memory leaks or unnecessary re-renders.

4. **Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.**
   - **Pass**: The code uses modern React and TypeScript features, indicating compatibility with the latest versions.

5. **Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.**
   - **Pass**: There are no console errors or warnings in the provided code.

6. **Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.**
   - **Pass**: The app does not access DOM elements directly to retrieve values.

7. **Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React virtual DOM.**
   - **Pass**: The app does not manipulate the DOM directly.

8. **Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React state and props.**
   - **Pass**: The app does not use refs for DOM access.

9. **Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.**
   - **Pass**: The state management is efficient, and there are no unnecessary re-renders.

10. **Ensure the code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility.**
    - **Fail**: The code is not decomposed into multiple components. The entire functionality is within a single `App` component.

11. **Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.**
    - **Pass**: The code does not contain any duplicates and follows DRY principles.

12. **App has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.**
    - **Pass**: The provided code maintains a consistent DOM tree structure.

13. **App does correctly use useEffect, avoiding infinite loops.**
    - **Pass**: The `useEffect` hook is correctly used, avoiding infinite loops.

14. **Confirm that axios is installed and listed as a dependency in package.json.**
    - **Pass**: The command `npm install axios` ensures that axios is installed and listed as a dependency.

15. **Verify that the fetched data is stored in a state variable using the useState hook.**
    - **Pass**: The fetched data is stored in the `characters` state variable using the `useState` hook.

16. **Verify that the code is optimized and does not contain any unnecessary parts or TODOs.**
    - **Pass**: The code is optimized and does not contain unnecessary parts or TODOs.

17. **Ensure that TypeScript is correctly integrated and used throughout the codebase.**
    - **Pass**: TypeScript is correctly integrated and used throughout the codebase.

18. **Verify that React.StrictMode is used in index.tsx.**
    - **Fail**: The provided code does not include `index.tsx`, so it is unclear if `React.StrictMode` is used.

### Summary

- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 18
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 16
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 2

Overall, the code is well-structured and follows best practices, but it could benefit from decomposing the functionality into multiple components and ensuring `React.StrictMode` is used in `index.tsx`.
