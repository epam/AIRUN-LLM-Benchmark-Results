### Step 1: Ensure that the API call to https://swapi.dev/api/people is made using axios.
- **Pass**: The code uses `axios.get<ApiResponse>('https://swapi.dev/api/people')` to make the API call.

### Step 2: Make sure the data is fetched initially without any input fields.
- **Pass**: The data is fetched in the `useEffect` hook which runs on component mount, and there are no input fields involved in the data fetching process.

### Step 3: Ensure a loader or loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
- **Pass**: The code uses a `loading` state to conditionally render a loading indicator (`<p>Loading...</p>`) while data is being fetched.

### Step 4: Verify that errors are logged to the console if the API call fails.
- **Pass**: The code catches errors in the `try...catch` block and logs them to the console with `console.error("Failed to fetch characters:", error)`.

### Step 5: Ensure that the fetched characters are displayed in a list format.
- **Pass**: The fetched characters are displayed in a list format using an unordered list (`<ul>`) and list items (`<li>`).

### Step 6: Make sure each list item has a unique key derived from the character URL.
- **Pass**: Each list item has a unique key derived from the character URL (`<li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>`).
