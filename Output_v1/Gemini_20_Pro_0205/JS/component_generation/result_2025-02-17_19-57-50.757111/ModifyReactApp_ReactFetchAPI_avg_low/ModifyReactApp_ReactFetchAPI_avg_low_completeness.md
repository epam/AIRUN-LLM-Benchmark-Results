# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that a loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass**: The code sets `loading` to `true` before making the API request and displays a "Loading..." message when `loading` is `true`.

### Step 2: Verify that the loader does not hide the search input when data is loading.
**Pass**: The search input is always rendered, regardless of the `loading` state.

### Step 3: Validate that a request with an empty search term is sent on the initial render.
**Pass**: The `useEffect` with an empty dependency array calls `fetchCharacters('')` on initial render.

### Step 4: Verify that the search input field is present.
**Pass**: The search input field is present and rendered in the return statement of the component.

### Step 5: Ensure that the character search functionality is implemented.
**Pass**: The search functionality is implemented using the `search` state and the `fetchCharacters` function.

### Step 6: Ensure that the API request includes the search term as a query parameter.
**Pass**: The `fetchCharacters` function constructs the API URL with the search term as a query parameter.

### Step 7: Validate that the data is loading on initial app load with empty query and then when the search term changes.
**Pass**: The `useEffect` hooks ensure that data is fetched on initial load and whenever the search term changes.

### Step 8: Ensure that the debounced fetch function prevents unnecessary API requests.
**Pass**: The `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout` mechanism in the `useEffect` hook debounces the API requests.

### Step 9: Confirm that the character list is updated based on the search results.
**Pass**: The `characters` state is updated with the search results and the list is rendered accordingly.

### Step 10: Validate that the application handles API request errors.
**Pass**: The `fetchCharacters` function includes a `try-catch` block to handle API request errors and logs them to the console.

### Step 11: Ensure that the user experience remains smooth without backend overloads.
**Pass**: The debouncing mechanism and error handling ensure a smooth user experience without overloading the backend.
