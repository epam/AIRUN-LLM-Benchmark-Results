# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### 1. Ensure that the application uses `$resource` objects for RESTful API communication.
**Pass**: The application uses the `REST` factory, which is likely based on AngularJS's `$resource` service, to interact with the backend API for CRUD operations.

### 2. Verify that the application saves page changes to local storage.
**Pass**: The application uses the browser's `localStorage` to temporarily store unsaved changes to a page, ensuring that data is not lost accidentally.

### 3. Confirm that the application initializes the page type correctly.
**Pass**: The application initializes the page type based on the active theme and provides a dropdown for the user to select the page type.

### 4. Validate that the application manages local storage for unsaved changes.
**Pass**: The application detects if a newer, unsaved version exists in `localStorage` and prompts the user to load it or discard it, effectively managing unsaved changes.

### 5. Verify that the application handles errors during saving or updating pages.
**Pass**: The application includes error handling during save/update operations and broadcasts notifications for errors, ensuring that users are informed of any issues.

### 6. Confirm that the application broadcasts events to update page variables and settings when necessary.
**Pass**: The application uses `$rootScope.$broadcast` to notify other parts of the application about changes, ensuring that page variables and settings are updated accordingly.

### 7. Validate that the application uses promises and callbacks for asynchronous operations.
**Pass**: The application uses promises and callbacks for asynchronous operations, such as API calls, ensuring that the code handles asynchronous tasks correctly.

### 8. Validate that the application broadcasts notifications for various operations (e.g., page saving, updating, deleting).
**Pass**: The application broadcasts notifications for various operations, such as saving, updating, and deleting pages, ensuring that users receive feedback on their actions.

### 9. Verify that the application supports scalability and maintainability through modular design.
**Pass**: The application is designed using AngularJS's modular architecture, which supports scalability and maintainability by organizing code into reusable components and services.

### 10. Confirm that the application optimizes performance through efficient API usage and local storage management.
**Fail**: While the application uses `localStorage` for draft saving, it does not include explicit performance optimizations, such as debouncing API calls for tag autocomplete or optimizing the handling of extras.

## Summary

- **Total Number of Steps Evaluated**: 10
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 9
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 1

Overall, the application meets most of the evaluation criteria, with the exception of explicit performance optimizations. The code provides a solid foundation for a content management system with features for content creation, editing, deletion, duplication, version control, and draft management. However, there is room for improvement in optimizing API usage and handling large datasets efficiently.
