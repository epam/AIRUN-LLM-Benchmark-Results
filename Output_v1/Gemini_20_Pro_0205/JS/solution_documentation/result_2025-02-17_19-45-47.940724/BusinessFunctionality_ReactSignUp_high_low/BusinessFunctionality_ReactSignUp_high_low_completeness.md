# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### 1. Verify that the code implements a signup form for a React application using Redux and `redux-form`.
**Pass** - The code uses `redux-form` to handle form state, validation, and submission, and integrates with Redux for state management.

### 2. Check for synchronous and asynchronous validation of form fields.
**Pass** - The code includes both synchronous and asynchronous validation for form fields.

### 3. Confirm the presence of synchronous validation for name, email, and password fields.
**Pass** - Synchronous validation checks for name length, valid email format, and password length.

### 4. Ensure that asynchronous validation checks if the name and email are already in use via API calls.
**Pass** - Asynchronous validation checks with the server to ensure the name and email are not already in use.

### 5. Ensure the form submission sends user data (name, email, password) to the backend API.
**Pass** - The form submission sends user data to the backend API for account creation.

### 6. Verify that successful signup dispatches an action to update the application state.
**Pass** - The `signupComplete` action is dispatched upon successful signup.

### 7. Check that real-time feedback on form validation errors is provided.
**Pass** - Real-time feedback is provided for form validation errors.

### 8. Ensure success or error messages are displayed based on form submission results.
**Pass** - Success or error messages are displayed based on the results of the form submission.

### 9. Confirm the presence of a link for existing users to navigate to the login page.
**Pass** - There is a link for existing users to navigate to the login page.

### 10. Determine if users can enter their name, email, and password into input fields.
**Pass** - Users can enter their name, email, and password into input fields.

### 11. Verify that real-time validation feedback is provided as users fill out the form.
**Pass** - Real-time validation feedback is provided as users fill out the form.

### 12. Check if the form submission process includes displaying validation errors or success messages.
**Pass** - The form submission process includes displaying validation errors or success messages.

### 13. Assess if the code enables new users to create an account on the platform.
**Pass** - The code enables new users to create an account on the platform.

### 14. Check if user information (name, email, password) is collected for account creation.
**Pass** - User information (name, email, password) is collected for account creation.

### 15. Determine if the code encourages user engagement by highlighting platform benefits.
**Fail** - The code does not explicitly highlight platform benefits to encourage user engagement.

### 16. Verify that the code ensures data integrity by validating user inputs both synchronously and asynchronously.
**Pass** - The code ensures data integrity by validating user inputs both synchronously and asynchronously.

### 17. Ensure it prevents duplicate accounts by checking for existing email or name.
**Pass** - The code prevents duplicate accounts by checking for existing email or name.
