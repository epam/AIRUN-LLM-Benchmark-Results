# Evaluation Report

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.**
   - **Pass**: All imports are used in the code.

2. **Ensure the codebase is structured and follows React best practices (state, hooks, effects).**
   - **Pass**: The code uses React hooks and effects appropriately.

3. **Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.**
   - **Pass**: The use of hooks and effects appears to be correct, minimizing unnecessary re-renders.

4. **Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.**
   - **Pass**: The code uses modern React and TypeScript features.

5. **Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.**
   - **Pass**: There are no apparent console errors or warnings in the provided code.

6. **Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.**
   - **Pass**: The app uses React state to manage form values.

7. **Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React virtual DOM.**
   - **Pass**: The app does not directly manipulate the DOM.

8. **Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React state and props.**
   - **Pass**: The app uses state and props appropriately without overusing refs.

9. **Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.**
   - **Pass**: The use of hooks and effects is optimized to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

10. **Ensure the code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility.**
    - **Pass**: The code is decomposed into multiple components, each with a single responsibility.

11. **Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.**
    - **Pass**: The code follows DRY principles and does not contain duplicates.

12. **App does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.**
    - **Pass**: The app uses React state to manage form values.

13. **App has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.**
    - **Pass**: The provided code maintains the same DOM structure and classes.

14. **Ensure that the store is properly configured and provided to the app.**
    - **Pass**: The store is properly configured and provided to the app.

15. **Verify that the code is migrated to React 18.x.**
    - **Pass**: The code uses modern React features compatible with React 18.x.

16. **Check that TypeScript is used in the translated code.**
    - **Pass**: The code is written in TypeScript.

17. **Confirm that Redux Toolkit with createSlice is used for managing local data.**
    - **Pass**: The code uses Redux Toolkit and createSlice for managing local data.

18. **Ensure that the code is split into separate components.**
    - **Pass**: The code is split into separate components.

19. **Validate that the code does not contain any TODOs.**
    - **Pass**: The code does not contain any TODOs.

20. **Check that the code is optimized.**
    - **Pass**: The code is optimized for performance and readability.
