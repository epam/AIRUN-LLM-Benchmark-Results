# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Confirm that the application initializes correctly and loads persisted todos.
- **Pass**: The `loadTodos$` effect in `todo.effects.ts` correctly loads todos from localStorage and dispatches `loadTodosSuccess` action to populate the state.

### Step 2: Ensure that the todo list displays correctly and is interactive.
- **Pass**: The `TodoListComponent` correctly subscribes to the `selectFilteredTodos` selector and displays the list of todos. The `trackByFn` function ensures efficient rendering.

### Step 3: Verify that adding a new todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoInputComponent` dispatches the `addTodo` action with the new todo title, and the `todoReducer` correctly adds the new todo to the state.

### Step 4: Check that editing a todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItemComponent` allows editing a todo's title and dispatches the `updateTodo` action to update the state. The `doneEditing` and `cancelEditing` methods handle the editing logic correctly.

### Step 5: Confirm that toggling a todo item completion status works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItemComponent` dispatches the `toggleTodo` action when the checkbox is clicked, and the `todoReducer` correctly toggles the completion status of the todo.

### Step 6: Ensure that removing a todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItemComponent` dispatches the `removeTodo` action when the delete button is clicked, and the `todoReducer` correctly removes the todo from the state.

### Step 7: Verify that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works.
- **Pass**: The `TodoListComponent` dispatches the `toggleAll` action with the correct completion status, and the `todoReducer` updates all todos' completion status accordingly.

### Step 8: Check that the filter functionality (All, Active, Completed) works.
- **Fail**: The `selectFilteredTodos` selector in `todo.selectors.ts` does not correctly handle the filter parameter. The `props` parameter is not passed correctly from the component.

### Step 9: Confirm that the "Clear completed" button works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFooterComponent` dispatches the `clearCompleted` action, and the `todoReducer` correctly removes all completed todos from the state.

### Step 10: Ensure that the application is responsive and functions correctly on different screen sizes.
- **Pass**: The application uses the TodoMVC CSS styles, which are known to be responsive and work well on different screen sizes.

## Summary

- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 10

The application mostly works as expected, but there is an issue with the filter functionality that needs to be addressed.
