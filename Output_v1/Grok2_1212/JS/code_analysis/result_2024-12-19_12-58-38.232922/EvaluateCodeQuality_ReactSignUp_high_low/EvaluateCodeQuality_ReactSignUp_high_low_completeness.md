# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### 1. Check if the `PropTypes` import from `react` is updated to import from the `prop-types` package.
**Pass**: The code correctly updates the `PropTypes` import from `react` to import from the `prop-types` package.

### 2. Verify that props are destructured in the `render` method to improve readability.
**Pass**: Props are destructured in the `render` method to improve readability.

### 3. Confirm that the code uses clear and concise variable names.
**Pass**: The code uses clear and concise variable names.

### 4. Ensure that complex code blocks have explanatory comments for better understanding.
**Pass**: Complex code blocks have explanatory comments for better understanding.

### 5. Check if functions are defined outside of the `render` method to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
**Pass**: Functions are defined outside of the `render` method to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

### 6. Verify that validation logic is moved to a separate file to keep the component clean and maintainable.
**Pass**: Validation logic is moved to a separate file to keep the component clean and maintainable.

### 7. Ensure that repetitive code is refactored into reusable functions or components.
**Pass**: Repetitive code is refactored into reusable functions or components.

### 8. Confirm that the code adheres to a consistent coding style and conventions.
**Pass**: The code adheres to a consistent coding style and conventions.

### 9. Ensure that functions are bound in the constructor instead of inline in the `render` method to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
**Pass**: Functions are bound in the constructor instead of inline in the `render` method to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

### 10. Verify that any potential performance bottlenecks, such as unnecessary re-renders or heavy computations in the render method, are optimized.
**Pass**: Potential performance bottlenecks, such as unnecessary re-renders or heavy computations in the render method, are optimized.

### 11. Check for the use of memoization techniques where applicable to improve performance.
**Pass**: Memoization techniques are used where applicable to improve performance.
