# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Check that a loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass**: The code includes a loading indicator (`<div>Loading...</div>`) that is displayed while the `loading` state is `true`.

### Step 2: Verify that the loader does not hide the search input when data is loading.
**Pass**: The search input is rendered outside the conditional rendering of the loading indicator, ensuring it is always visible.

### Step 3: Validate that a request with an empty search term is sent on the initial render.
**Pass**: The `useEffect` hook calls `fetchCharacters()` with an empty query on the initial render.

### Step 4: Verify that the search input field is present.
**Pass**: The search input field is present in the JSX (`<input type="text" ... />`).

### Step 5: Ensure that the character search functionality is implemented.
**Pass**: The search functionality is implemented using the `handleInputChange` function and the `handleSearch` function with debouncing.

### Step 6: Ensure that the API request includes the search term as a query parameter.
**Pass**: The `fetchCharacters` function includes the search term in the API request URL (`https://swapi.dev/api/people/?search=${query}`).

### Step 7: Validate that the data is loading on initial app load with empty query and then when the search term changes.
**Pass**: The `useEffect` hook ensures data is loaded on initial app load, and the `handleSearch` function ensures data is loaded when the search term changes.

### Step 8: Ensure that the debounced fetch function prevents unnecessary API requests.
**Pass**: The `handleSearch` function is debounced using `lodash.debounce` to limit the number of API requests.

### Step 9: Confirm that the character list is updated based on the search results.
**Pass**: The character list is updated based on the search results by setting the `characters` state with the fetched data.

### Step 10: Validate that the application handles API request errors.
**Pass**: The `fetchCharacters` function includes a `try-catch` block to handle API request errors and logs them to the console.

### Step 11: Ensure that the user experience remains smooth without backend overloads.
**Pass**: The use of debouncing and efficient state management ensures a smooth user experience without overloading the backend.
