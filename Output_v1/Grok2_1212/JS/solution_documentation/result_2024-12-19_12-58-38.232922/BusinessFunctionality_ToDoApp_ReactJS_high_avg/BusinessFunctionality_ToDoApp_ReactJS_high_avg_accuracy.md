# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Pass**: Confirm that constraints related to local storage limitations are noted.
   - The report mentions that the application relies on local storage for persistence, which limits its scalability for large-scale applications and multi-user scenarios.

2. **Pass**: Verify that assumptions about the application being designed for a single user are mentioned.
   - The report states that the application is designed for single-user use, with no consideration for multi-user scenarios or server-side synchronization.

3. **Pass**: Ensure that browser compatibility assumptions are included.
   - The report includes the assumption of modern browser support for features like local storage and client-side routing.

4. **Pass**: Check that performance-related constraints are noted.
   - The report mentions minimal error handling and validation, assuming users will input valid data, which is a performance-related constraint.

5. **Pass**: Confirm that performance optimizations, such as the use of `shouldComponentUpdate`, are identified.
   - The report identifies the use of `shouldComponentUpdate` in the `TodoItem` component to improve rendering performance.

6. **Pass**: Verify that considerations for using immutable data structures for performance are mentioned.
   - The report mentions the use of functional programming techniques like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` to work with immutable data structures, which can improve performance.

7. **Pass**: Ensure scalability considerations related to local storage limitations are discussed.
   - The report discusses the limitations of using local storage for persistence, noting that it may become a bottleneck for larger datasets or more complex data structures.

8. **Pass**: Check that the potential need for a backend service for better scalability is mentioned.
   - The report mentions that the current architecture may face challenges in scaling to large user bases or complex features without significant refactoring, such as moving to a server-side solution for data management.

9. **Pass**: Confirm that the evaluation steps are unambiguous and concise.
   - The evaluation steps are clear and concise, allowing the evaluator to assess the output based solely on the provided code.

10. **Pass**: Ensure that each step allows the evaluator to assess the output based solely on the provided code.
    - Each step is designed to be assessed based on the provided code and the analysis in the report.

11. **Pass**: Verify that the steps are clearly articulated and cover all main points of the task.
    - The steps are clearly articulated and cover all the main points of the task, including functionality, user interaction, business objectives, constraints, assumptions, performance, and scalability.
