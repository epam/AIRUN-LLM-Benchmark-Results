### Step 2: Ensure the codebase is structured and follows Angular style guidelines and best practices.
**Pass**: The codebase is well-structured, with components, services, and state management separated appropriately.

### Step 3: Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of Angular and TypeScript.
**Pass**: The code uses Angular 14.x features and syntax, indicating compatibility with the latest version.

### Step 4: Verify the application works correctly across modern browsers.
**Not Evaluated**: This step requires running the application in various browsers, which is not possible in this static evaluation.

### Step 5: Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.
**Not Evaluated**: This step requires running the application and checking the console, which is not possible in this static evaluation.

### Step 6: Ensure the code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility.
**Pass**: The code is decomposed into multiple components and services, each with a single responsibility.

### Step 7: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
**Pass**: The code does not contain any obvious duplicates and follows DRY principles.

### Step 8: Ensure the application handles API errors.
**Pass**: The `signup.service.ts` includes error handling using `catchError`.

### Step 9: Validate that @ngrx/store is used for state management and that the state is properly defined in auth.reducer.ts and app.state.ts.
**Pass**: The code uses `@ngrx/store` for state management, and the state is properly defined in `auth.reducer.ts`.

### Step 10: Verify the UI and UX by running the Angular application and ensuring that the signup form behaves as expected, including form validation and error messages.
**Not Evaluated**: This step requires running the application and interacting with the UI, which is not possible in this static evaluation.

**Pass**: The `onSubmit` method in `signup.component.ts` dispatches the signup action upon form submission.

### Step 12: Verify app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of Angular framework.
**Pass**: The code does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of Angular's framework.

### Step 13: Verify app does not overuse Angular references for DOM access instead of Angular state and props.
**Pass**: The code uses Angular state and props appropriately without overusing direct DOM access.

### Step 14: Check that there are no TODOs or incomplete parts in the code.
**Pass**: The code does not contain any TODOs or incomplete parts.
