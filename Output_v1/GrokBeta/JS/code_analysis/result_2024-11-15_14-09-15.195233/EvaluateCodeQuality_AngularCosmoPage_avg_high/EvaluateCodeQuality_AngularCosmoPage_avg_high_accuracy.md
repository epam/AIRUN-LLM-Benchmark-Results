### 5. Ensure that dependency injection is used properly and suggest improvements if necessary.
**Pass**: The answer suggests improvements in the use of services and factories, which are part of dependency injection.

### 6. Check if unit tests are present and suggest adding them if they are missing.
**Fail**: The answer does not explicitly check for the presence of unit tests or suggest adding them if they are missing.

### 7. Identify parts of the code that are hard to test and suggest refactoring them to be more testable.
**Pass**: The answer identifies long functions and tightly coupled logic within controllers, suggesting refactoring to make the code more testable.

### 8. Ensure that external dependencies are properly mocked in tests and suggest improvements if needed.
**Fail**: The answer does not address the mocking of external dependencies in tests.

### 9. Check if edge cases are covered in tests and suggest adding tests for them if they are missing.
**Fail**: The answer does not address the coverage of edge cases in tests.

### 10. Ensure that appropriate testing libraries are used and suggest improvements if necessary.
