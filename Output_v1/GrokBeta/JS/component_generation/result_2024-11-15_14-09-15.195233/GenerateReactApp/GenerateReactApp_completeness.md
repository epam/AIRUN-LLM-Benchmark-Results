# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Ensure that the API call to https://swapi.dev/api/people is made using axios.
**Pass**: The API call to `https://swapi.dev/api/people` is made using axios in the `fetchCharacters` function within the `useEffect` hook in `App.tsx`.

### Step 2: Make sure the data is fetched initially without any input fields.
**Pass**: The data is fetched initially without any input fields. The `useEffect` hook ensures that the data is fetched when the component mounts.

### Step 3: Ensure a loader or loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass**: A loader component (`Loader.tsx`) is displayed while data is being fetched. The `isLoading` state is used to conditionally render the `Loader` component.

### Step 4: Verify that errors are logged to the console if the API call fails.
**Pass**: Errors are logged to the console if the API call fails. The `catch` block in the `fetchCharacters` function logs the error using `console.error`.

### Step 5: Ensure that the fetched characters are displayed in a list format.
**Pass**: The fetched characters are displayed in a list format using the `CharacterList` component. The `characters` state is passed as a prop to the `CharacterList` component, which renders the list of characters.

### Step 6: Make sure each list item has a unique key derived from the character URL.
**Fail**: Each list item has a key derived from the index of the character in the array, not from the character URL. The key should be derived from a unique property such as the character URL to ensure uniqueness.

### Summary
- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 6
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 5
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 1

Overall, the implementation is mostly correct, with the exception of the unique key for list items. The key should be derived from a unique property such as the character URL instead of the index.
