# Evaluation Report

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.**
   - **Pass**: All imports are used in the code.

2. **Ensure the codebase is structured and follows React best practices (state, hooks, effects).**
   - **Pass**: The code is well-structured and follows React best practices.

3. **Check that a debounced function is used to optimize the search requests.**
   - **Pass**: A debounced function is used to optimize search requests.

4. **Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.**
   - **Pass**: The use of `useCallback` and proper cleanup in `useEffect` ensures no memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.

5. **Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.**
   - **Pass**: The code is compatible with the latest versions of React and TypeScript.

6. **Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.**
   - **Pass**: The code does not contain any console errors or warnings.

7. **Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.**
   - **Pass**: The app uses React state to manage text field values.

8. **Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React virtual DOM.**
   - **Pass**: The app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React virtual DOM.

9. **Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React state and props.**
   - **Pass**: The app does not overuse refs and appropriately uses React state and props.

10. **Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.**
    - **Pass**: The code follows DRY principles and does not contain duplicates.

11. **Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.**
    - **Pass**: The app is optimized to prevent too many re-renders.

12. **Confirm that the useState is used to capture the search input value.**
    - **Pass**: `useState` is used to capture the search input value.

13. **Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs.**
    - **Pass**: The code does not contain any TODOs.

14. **Verify the inclusion of TypeScript in the React application.**
    - **Pass**: TypeScript is used in the React application.

15. **Ensure that `axios` is used for making API requests.**
    - **Pass**: `axios` is used for making API requests.

16. **Validate that the `useEffect` hooks are used correctly for data loading.**
    - **Pass**: `useEffect` hooks are used correctly for data loading.
