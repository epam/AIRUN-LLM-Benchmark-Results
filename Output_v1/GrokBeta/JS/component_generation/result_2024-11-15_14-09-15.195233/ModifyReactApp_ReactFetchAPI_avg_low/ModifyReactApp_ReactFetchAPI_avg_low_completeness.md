# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that a loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass**: The code includes a loading state (`loading`) and conditionally renders a loading indicator (`<div>Loading...</div>`) when `loading` is true.

### Step 2: Verify that the loader does not hide the search input when data is loading.
**Pass**: The search input is rendered outside the conditional loading block, ensuring it remains visible even when data is being fetched.

### Step 3: Validate that a request with an empty search term is sent on the initial render.
**Pass**: The `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array calls `fetchCharacters('', 1)` on initial render, sending a request with an empty search term.

### Step 4: Verify that the search input field is present.
**Pass**: The search input field is present in the JSX: `<input type="text" value={searchTerm} onChange={handleSearchChange} placeholder="Search for characters..." />`.

### Step 5: Ensure that the character search functionality is implemented.
**Pass**: The search functionality is implemented using the `searchTerm` state and the `handleSearchChange` function to update it.

### Step 6: Ensure that the API request includes the search term as a query parameter.
**Pass**: The `fetchCharacters` function includes the search term as a query parameter in the API request: `params: { search: search, page: pageNumber }`.

### Step 7: Validate that the data is loading on initial app load with empty query and then when the search term changes.
**Pass**: The initial data load is handled by the `useEffect` with an empty dependency array, and subsequent loads are handled by the `useEffect` that depends on `debouncedSearchTerm`.

### Step 8: Ensure that the debounced fetch function prevents unnecessary API requests.
**Pass**: The `useEffect` with the debounce logic ensures that the `fetchCharacters` function is called only after a 300ms delay, preventing unnecessary API requests.

### Step 9: Confirm that the character list is updated based on the search results.
**Pass**: The character list is updated by setting the `characters` state with the results from the API response.

### Step 10: Validate that the application handles API request errors.
**Pass**: The `fetchCharacters` function includes a try-catch block to handle API request errors and logs them to the console.

### Step 11: Ensure that the user experience remains smooth without backend overloads.
**Pass**: The debounce mechanism and the use of `useCallback` for the `fetchCharacters` function help ensure a smooth user experience without overloading the backend.
