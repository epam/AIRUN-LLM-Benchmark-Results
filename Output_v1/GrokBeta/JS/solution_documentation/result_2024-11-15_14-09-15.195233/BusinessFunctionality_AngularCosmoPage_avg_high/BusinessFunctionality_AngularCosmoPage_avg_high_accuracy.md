# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps:

1. **Ensure that the application uses `$resource` objects for RESTful API communication.**
   - **Pass**: The `rest.js` file provides an interface to interact with a RESTful backend API using `$resource` objects for various entities.

2. **Verify that the application saves page changes to local storage.**
   - **Pass**: The `pageCtrl.js` file implements local storage for unsaved changes to prevent data loss.

3. **Confirm that the application initializes the page type correctly.**
   - **Pass**: The `pageCtrl.js` file manages page attributes, including the page type, ensuring correct initialization.

4. **Validate that the application manages local storage for unsaved changes.**
   - **Pass**: The `pageCtrl.js` file includes functionality to notify users of unsaved changes from previous sessions and allows them to revert or discard these changes.

5. **Verify that the application handles errors during saving or updating pages.**
   - **Fail**: There is no explicit mention of error handling during saving or updating pages in the provided description.

6. **Confirm that the application broadcasts events to update page variables and settings when necessary.**
   - **Fail**: The provided description does not mention broadcasting events to update page variables and settings.

7. **Validate that the application uses promises and callbacks for asynchronous operations.**
   - **Fail**: The provided description does not mention the use of promises or callbacks for asynchronous operations.

8. **Validate that the application broadcasts notifications for various operations (e.g., page saving, updating, deleting).**
   - **Fail**: The provided description does not mention broadcasting notifications for various operations.

9. **Verify that the application supports scalability and maintainability through modular design.**
   - **Pass**: The application is designed with modular components like `rest.js`, `page.js`, `users.js`, and `pageCtrl.js`, supporting scalability and maintainability.

10. **Confirm that the application optimizes performance through efficient API usage and local storage management.**
    - **Pass**: The application uses `$resource` for efficient API calls and local storage for temporary data, improving performance.

### Summary:

- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 10
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 6
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 4

Overall, the application demonstrates good practices in using `$resource` for RESTful API communication, managing local storage for unsaved changes, initializing page types correctly, and supporting scalability through modular design. However, it lacks explicit details on error handling, event broadcasting, use of promises and callbacks, and broadcasting notifications for various operations.
