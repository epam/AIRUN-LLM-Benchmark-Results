# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that the main component displays the header with input for new todos.
**Pass**: The `app.component.html` contains a header with an input field for new todos.

### Step 2: Ensure that adding a new todo item works correctly.
**Pass**: The `handleNewTodoKeyDown` method in `app.component.ts` handles adding new todos when the Enter key is pressed.

### Step 3: Verify that the todo list displays all added todo items.
**Pass**: The `app.component.html` uses `*ngFor` to iterate over `todos$` and display each todo item using the `app-todo-item` component.

### Step 4: Confirm that toggle functionality works for marking todos as completed.
**Pass**: The `toggle` method in `app.component.ts` dispatches the `toggleTodo` action, and the `todoReducer` handles this action to update the state.

### Step 5: Check that editing a todo item works and updates the todo item correctly.
**Pass**: The `edit` and `save` methods in `app.component.ts` handle editing and saving todo items. The `todo-item.component.ts` also has the necessary logic to handle editing.

### Step 6: Ensure that deleting a todo item removes it from the list.
**Pass**: The `destroy` method in `app.component.ts` dispatches the `deleteTodo` action, and the `todoReducer` handles this action to update the state.

### Step 7: Verify that the footer correctly displays the count of active items.
**Pass**: The `app-todo-footer` component in `app.component.html` receives `activeTodoCount$` as an input and displays the count of active items.

### Step 8: Confirm that the footer's clear completed button works and removes completed items.
**Pass**: The `clearCompleted` method in `app.component.ts` dispatches the `clearCompleted` action, and the `todoReducer` handles this action to update the state.

### Step 9: Check that filtering todos by "all", "active", and "completed" works correctly.
**Fail**: The provided code does not include the implementation for filtering todos by "all", "active", and "completed". The `nowShowing` variable is set to `ALL_TODOS`, but there is no logic to change this value or filter the todos based on it.

### Step 10: Ensure that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works correctly.
**Pass**: The `toggleAll` method in `app.component.ts` dispatches the `toggleAll` action, and the `todoReducer` handles this action to update the state.

### Step 11: Check that the application persists todos to local storage and reloads them correctly.
**Fail**: The provided code does not include any logic for persisting todos to local storage or reloading them from local storage.
