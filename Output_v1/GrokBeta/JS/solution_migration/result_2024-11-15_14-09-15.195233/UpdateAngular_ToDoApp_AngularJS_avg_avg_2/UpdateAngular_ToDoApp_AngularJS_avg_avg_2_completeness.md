# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Confirm that the application initializes correctly and loads persisted todos.
- **Pass**: The provided code includes the necessary setup for initializing the Angular application with NgRx for state management. The `StoreModule` and `EffectsModule` are correctly imported and configured in `app.module.ts`.

### Step 2: Ensure that the todo list displays correctly and is interactive.
- **Pass**: The `TodoListComponent` is correctly set up to display the list of todos using the `selectTodos` selector. The `*ngFor` directive is used to iterate over the todos and display each `TodoItemComponent`.

### Step 3: Verify that adding a new todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoHeaderComponent` includes a form with an input field bound to `newTodo` and a submit event that dispatches the `addTodo` action. The `todoReducer` handles the `addTodo` action to add a new todo to the state.

### Step 4: Check that editing a todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItemComponent` includes logic for editing a todo. The `editTodo` action is dispatched when a todo is double-clicked, and the `doneEditing` method is set up to handle saving changes.

### Step 5: Confirm that toggling a todo item completion status works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItemComponent` includes a checkbox that dispatches the `toggleTodo` action when changed. The `todoReducer` handles the `toggleTodo` action to update the completion status of the todo.

### Step 6: Ensure that removing a todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItemComponent` includes a button that dispatches the `removeTodo` action when clicked. The `todoReducer` handles the `removeTodo` action to remove the todo from the state.

### Step 7: Verify that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works.
- **Pass**: The `TodoListComponent` includes a checkbox that dispatches the `toggleAll` action when changed. The `todoReducer` handles the `toggleAll` action to update the completion status of all todos.

### Step 8: Check that the filter functionality (All, Active, Completed) works.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include the necessary routing setup or filter logic to handle different views (All, Active, Completed). The `TodoFooterComponent` includes links for the filters, but the routing and filtering logic are missing.

### Step 9: Confirm that the "Clear completed" button works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFooterComponent` includes a button that dispatches the `clearCompleted` action when clicked. The `todoReducer` handles the `clearCompleted` action to remove completed todos from the state.

### Step 10: Ensure that the application is responsive and functions correctly on different screen sizes.
- **Pass**: The provided code uses the TodoMVC CSS styles, which are designed to be responsive. The application should function correctly on different screen sizes.
