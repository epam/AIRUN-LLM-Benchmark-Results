### 3. Ensure that proper error handling is in place and suggest improvements if necessary.
**Fail**: The provided answer does not address error handling in the code. This is a critical aspect that should be evaluated.

### 4. Check for consistent code formatting and suggest adhering to a style guide if inconsistencies are found.
**Pass**: The provided answer addresses readability and maintainability, which includes aspects of code formatting. The suggestions for clearer variable names and modular structure contribute to consistent code formatting.

### 5. Ensure that dependency injection is used properly and suggest improvements if necessary.
**Pass**: The provided answer addresses dependency injection by suggesting the removal of unused dependencies and modularizing the code.

### 6. Check if unit tests are present and suggest adding them if they are missing.
**Pass**: The provided answer identifies the lack of unit tests and suggests adding them, including an example of a unit test for the `savePage` function.

### 7. Identify parts of the code that are hard to test and suggest refactoring them to be more testable.
**Pass**: The provided answer suggests refactoring complex conditional statements and non-modular structures, which would make the code more testable.

### 8. Ensure that external dependencies are properly mocked in tests and suggest improvements if needed.
**Fail**: The provided answer does not address the mocking of external dependencies in tests.

### 9. Check if edge cases are covered in tests and suggest adding tests for them if they are missing.
**Fail**: The provided answer does not address the coverage of edge cases in tests.

### 10. Ensure that appropriate testing libraries are used and suggest improvements if necessary.
**Pass**: The provided answer includes an example of a unit test using a common testing library (Jasmine), indicating the use of appropriate testing libraries.

### 11. Check if detailed comments explaining the purpose and functionality of various parts are present and suggest adding them if they are missing.
**Pass**: The provided answer identifies the lack of comments and suggests adding them, including an example of a comment for the `savePage` function.

### 12. Identify inconsistent commenting styles and suggest adhering to a consistent style guide.
