# Evaluation Report

## Readability

### 1. Unclear Variable Names
**Pass**: The variable `elements` was renamed to `pageProperties`, making it more descriptive.

### 2. Complex Conditional Statements
**Pass**: The complex conditional statement was simplified by breaking it into smaller, more descriptive variables (`isNewPage` and `isDuplicate`).

## Maintainability

### 1. Non-Modular Structure
**Pass**: The code was refactored to be more modular by separating the controller and service into different files (`pageCtrl.js` and `pageService.js`).

## Performance

### 1. Unnecessary DOM Manipulations
**Pass**: The unnecessary DOM manipulation was removed by setting a scope variable (`pageSaved`) and using it in the HTML template to conditionally display content.

## Accessibility

### 1. Missing ARIA Attributes
**Pass**: The `select` element was updated to include an ARIA attribute (`aria-label`).

## Best Practices

### 1. Unused Dependencies
**Pass**: The unused `$upload` dependency was removed from the controller.

## Testing

### 1. Lack of Unit Tests
**Pass**: A unit test was added for the `savePage` function in the `pageCtrl.js` file.

## Documentation

### 1. Lack of Comments
**Pass**: A comment was added to the `savePage` function to describe its purpose and parameters.
