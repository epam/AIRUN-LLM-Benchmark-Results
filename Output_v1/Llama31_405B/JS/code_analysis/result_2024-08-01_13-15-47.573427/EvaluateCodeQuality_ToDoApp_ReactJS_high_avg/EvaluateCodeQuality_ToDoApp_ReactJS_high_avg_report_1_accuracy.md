# Evaluation Report

## Readability
### 1. Unclear variable names
**Pass**: The variable names in the code are not descriptive, making it difficult to understand the purpose of each variable. The provided example and fixed issue demonstrate a clear improvement in readability.

### 2. Complex conditional statements
**Pass**: The code has complex conditional statements that are hard to read and understand. The provided example and fixed issue show a more modular and readable approach.

## Maintainability
### 1. Non-modular structure
**Pass**: The code is not modular, making it difficult to maintain and update. The provided example and fixed issue demonstrate a more modular structure.

### 2. Hard-to-maintain state management
**Pass**: The state management is not scalable and hard to maintain. The provided example and fixed issue show a more maintainable approach using hooks.

## Performance
### 1. Unnecessary re-renders
**Fail**: The provided example and fixed issue do not correctly demonstrate the use of `useMemo` for memoization. The `useMemo` should be used inside the functional component, not as a component itself.

## Accessibility
### 1. Lack of accessibility attributes
**Pass**: The code lacks accessibility attributes, making it difficult for screen readers to navigate. The provided example and fixed issue show an improvement in accessibility.

## Best Practices
### 1. Deviation from React best practices
**Pass**: The code deviates from React best practices, such as using `bind` instead of arrow functions. The provided example and fixed issue demonstrate adherence to best practices.

## Testing
### 1. Lack of testability
**Pass**: The code lacks testability due to the lack of separation of concerns. The provided example and fixed issue show an improvement in testability.

## Documentation
### 1. Lack of documentation
**Pass**: The code lacks documentation, making it difficult for others to understand the functionality. The provided example and fixed issue demonstrate the addition of JSDoc comments and inline comments.
