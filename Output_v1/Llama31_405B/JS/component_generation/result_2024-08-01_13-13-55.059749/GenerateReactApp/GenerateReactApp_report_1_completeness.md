# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Ensure that the API call to https://swapi.dev/api/people is made using axios.
**Pass**: The code uses `axios.get<Response>('https://swapi.dev/api/people')` to make the API call.

### Step 2: Make sure the data is fetched initially without any input fields.
**Pass**: The data is fetched in the `useEffect` hook which runs once when the component mounts, without any input fields.

### Step 3: Ensure a loader or loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass**: The code uses a `loading` state to display a loading indicator (`<div>Loading...</div>`) while data is being fetched.

### Step 4: Verify that errors are logged to the console if the API call fails.
**Pass**: The code includes a `.catch(error => { console.error(error); setLoading(false); })` block to log errors to the console if the API call fails.

### Step 5: Ensure that the fetched characters are displayed in a list format.
**Pass**: The fetched characters are displayed in a list format using `<ul>` and `<li>` elements.

### Step 6: Make sure each list item has a unique key derived from the character’s URL.
**Fail**: The list items use the index as the key (`key={index}`), which is not unique. The key should be derived from the character’s URL.
