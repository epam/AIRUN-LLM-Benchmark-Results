# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### 1. Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.
**Pass**: All imports (`React`, `useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `axios`, `debounce`) are used in the code.

### 2. Ensure the codebase is structured and follows React best practices (state, hooks, effects).
**Pass**: The code uses `useState` for state management, `useEffect` for side effects, and `useMemo` for memoizing the debounced function.

### 3. Check that a debounced function is used to optimize the search requests.
**Pass**: The `debouncedFetchCharacters` function is created using `lodash.debounce` to optimize search requests.

### 4. Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.
**Pass**: The use of `useMemo` for the debounced function and proper dependency arrays in `useEffect` hooks help prevent unnecessary re-renders and potential memory leaks.

### 5. Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.
**Pass**: The code uses modern React hooks and TypeScript interfaces, ensuring compatibility with the latest versions.

### 6. Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.
**Pass**: There are no apparent console errors or warnings in the provided code.

### 7. Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.
**Pass**: The app uses React's state (`searchTerm`) to manage the value of the search input field.

### 8. Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React’s virtual DOM.
**Pass**: The app does not directly manipulate the DOM; it relies on React's virtual DOM.

### 9. Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React’s state and props.
**Pass**: The app does not use refs for DOM access; it uses state and props appropriately.

### 10. Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
**Pass**: The code is concise and does not contain any duplicate logic.

### 11. Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.
**Pass**: The use of `useMemo` and proper dependency arrays in `useEffect` hooks help minimize unnecessary re-renders.

### 12. Confirm that the useState is used to capture the search input value.
**Pass**: The `useState` hook is used to capture and manage the `searchTerm` value.

### 13. Verify that the code does not contain any TODOs.
**Pass**: There are no TODO comments in the code.

### 14. Verify the inclusion of TypeScript in the React application.
**Pass**: The code uses TypeScript interfaces (`Character`) and type annotations.

### 15. Ensure that `axios` is used for making API requests.
**Pass**: The `axios` library is used to make API requests to the SWAPI.

### 16. Validate that the `useEffect` hooks are used correctly for data loading.
**Pass**: The `useEffect` hooks are used correctly to load data on initial render and when the `searchTerm` changes.
