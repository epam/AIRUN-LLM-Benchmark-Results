# Evaluation Report

## Steps

### 1. Check that a loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass**: The code includes a loading state (`loading`) and displays "Loading..." when `loading` is true.

### 2. Verify that the loader does not hide the search input when data is loading.
**Pass**: The search input field is always rendered regardless of the loading state.

### 3. Validate that a request with an empty search term is sent on the initial render.
**Pass**: The `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array calls `fetchCharacters('')` on the initial render.

### 4. Verify that the search input field is present.
**Pass**: The search input field is present in the JSX with the type `search`.

### 5. Ensure that the character search functionality is implemented.
**Pass**: The `handleSearch` function updates the `searchTerm` state, which triggers the debounced `fetchCharacters` function.

### 6. Ensure that the API request includes the search term as a query parameter.
**Pass**: The `fetchCharacters` function includes the `searchTerm` as a query parameter in the API request.

### 7. Validate that the data is loading on initial app load with empty query and then when the search term changes.
**Pass**: The initial `useEffect` hook loads data with an empty query, and the second `useEffect` hook loads data when the `searchTerm` changes.

### 8. Ensure that the debounced fetch function prevents unnecessary API requests.
**Pass**: The `debouncedFetchCharacters` function is created using `lodash.debounce` with a 500ms delay to prevent unnecessary API requests.

### 9. Confirm that the character list is updated based on the search results.
**Pass**: The character list is updated based on the `characters` state, which is set by the `fetchCharacters` function.

### 10. Validate that the application handles API request errors.
**Pass**: The `fetchCharacters` function includes a try-catch block to handle API request errors and logs them to the console.

### 11. Ensure that the user experience remains smooth without backend overloads.
**Pass**: The use of `lodash.debounce` ensures that the backend is not overloaded with requests, providing a smooth user experience.
