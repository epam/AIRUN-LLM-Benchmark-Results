# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps:

1. **Verify that all React components and their functionalities are correctly translated into Angular components.**
   - **Pass**: The provided code includes Angular components (`SignupComponent` and `FormGroupComponent`) that replicate the functionality of the React components.

2. **Ensure that the form validation logic is implemented using Angular's reactive forms.**
   - **Pass**: The `SignupComponent` uses Angular's reactive forms (`FormGroup`, `FormControl`, `Validators`) for form validation.

3. **Check that the application includes the necessary form controls and validation rules.**
   - **Pass**: The form controls for `name`, `email`, and `password` are included with appropriate validation rules (e.g., required, minLength, maxLength, email).

4. **Confirm that the application correctly binds the form controls and handles form submission.**
   - **Pass**: The form controls are correctly bound using `formControlName`, and the form submission is handled by the `handleSubmit` method.

5. **Ensure the application correctly displays form validation errors.**
   - **Pass**: The `FormGroupComponent` displays validation errors when the form fields are touched and invalid.

6. **Verify that the application contains actions for signup, signup success, and signup failure.**
   - **Fail**: The provided code only includes the `signupComplete` action. There are no actions for signup initiation or signup failure.

7. **Ensure that the auth.effects.ts file correctly handles side effects using @ngrx/effects, including calling the API and dispatching success or failure actions.**
   - **Fail**: The `AuthEffects` class handles the `signupComplete` action but does not handle the API call or dispatch success/failure actions.

8. **Validate that the API call to signup is correctly integrated and that the response is handled properly.**
   - **Pass**: The `Api` service includes a `signup` method that makes the API call, and the `handleSubmit` method in `SignupComponent` handles the response.

9. **Confirm that the application navigates to the login page correctly when the link is clicked.**
   - **Pass**: The `routerLink` directive is used to navigate to the login page when the link is clicked.
