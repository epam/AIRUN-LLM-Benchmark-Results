# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that the main component displays the header with input for new todos.
**Pass**: The `todo-app.component.html` contains a header with an input field for new todos.

### Step 2: Ensure that adding a new todo item works correctly.
**Pass**: The `handleNewTodoKeyDown` method in `todo-app.component.ts` dispatches the `addTodo` action when the Enter key is pressed.

### Step 3: Verify that the todo list displays all added todo items.
**Pass**: The `todo-app.component.html` uses `*ngFor` to iterate over `todos` and display each todo item.

### Step 4: Confirm that toggle functionality works for marking todos as completed.
**Pass**: The `toggle` method in `todo-app.component.ts` dispatches the `toggle` action, and the `todo.reducers.ts` handles this action correctly.

### Step 5: Check that editing a todo item works and updates the todo item correctly.
**Pass**: The `edit` method sets the `editing` property, and the `save` method dispatches the `save` action to update the todo item.

### Step 6: Ensure that deleting a todo item removes it from the list.
**Pass**: The `destroy` method in `todo-app.component.ts` dispatches the `destroy` action, and the `todo.reducers.ts` handles this action correctly.

### Step 7: Verify that the footer correctly displays the count of active items.
**Pass**: The footer in `todo-app.component.html` correctly displays the count of active items using Angular's interpolation.

### Step 8: Confirm that the footer's clear completed button works and removes completed items.
**Pass**: The `clearCompleted` method in `todo-app.component.ts` dispatches the `clearCompleted` action, and the `todo.reducers.ts` handles this action correctly.

### Step 9: Check that filtering todos by "all", "active", and "completed" works correctly.
**Fail**: The current implementation does not include logic to filter todos based on the `nowShowing` property.

### Step 10: Ensure that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works correctly.
**Pass**: The `toggleAll` method in `todo-app.component.ts` dispatches the `toggleAll` action, and the `todo.reducers.ts` handles this action correctly.

### Step 11: Check that the application persists todos to local storage and reloads them correctly.
**Fail**: The `todo.effects.ts` references `TodoActions.load` and `TodoActions.loadSuccess`, but these actions are not defined in `todo.actions.ts`.
