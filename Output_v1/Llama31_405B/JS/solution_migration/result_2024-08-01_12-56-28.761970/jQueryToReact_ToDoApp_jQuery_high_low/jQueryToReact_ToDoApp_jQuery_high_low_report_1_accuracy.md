# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Pass**: Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.
2. **Pass**: Ensure the codebase is structured and follows React best practices (state, hooks, effects).
3. **Pass**: Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.
4. **Pass**: Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.
5. **Pass**: Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.
6. **Pass**: Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.
7. **Pass**: Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React’s virtual DOM.
8. **Pass**: Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React’s state and props.
9. **Pass**: Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.
10. **Pass**: Ensure the code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility.
11. **Pass**: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
12. **Pass**: Verify app does not make API calls.
13. **Pass**: Verify that the codebase does not contain any TODOs.
14. **Pass**: Ensure that the code is split into separate components.
15. **Pass**: Verify app does clean up timers, subscriptions, or event listeners in `useEffect`.
16. **Pass**: App has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.
17. **Pass**: Verify that the codebase is written in TypeScript.
18. **Pass**: Ensure that TypeScript types are correctly defined and used throughout the code.
19. **Pass**: Confirm that the codebase does not contain any syntax errors.
20. **Pass**: Ensure that the `package.json` file is present.
21. **Pass**: Verify the presence of a store configuration file.
22. **Pass**: Confirm that the store configuration file uses Redux Toolkit.
23. **Pass**: Verify that the application uses `createSlice` from Redux Toolkit to define actions and reducers for adding, toggling one and all, editing, deleting, clearing completed, and filtering TODO items.
24. **Pass**: Confirm the use of `nanoid` for generating unique IDs.
25. **Pass**: Check that the code includes a `Provider` wrapping the entire application.
26. **Pass**: Confirm that the `Provider` is supplied with the store.
