# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
- **Pass**: The `AddTodo` component includes an input field and a form submission handler that dispatches the `addTodo` action to the store. However, the code does not explicitly mention handling the Enter key, but it is implied by the form submission.

### Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
- **Pass**: The `TodoList` component uses the `useSelector` hook to get the todos and filter from the state and filters the todos accordingly before rendering them.

### Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
- **Fail**: There is no functionality or component provided that allows toggling the completion status of all todos at once.

### Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItem` component includes functionality to toggle (`handleToggle`) and delete (`handleRemove`) each todo item. However, there is no functionality for editing a todo item.

### Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
- **Fail**: There is no functionality provided for editing a todo item, starting with a double click, submitting with Enter, or resetting with Esc.

### Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
- **Fail**: The `Footer` component includes filter functionality but does not display the count of active items or provide a way to clear completed items.

### Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
- **Fail**: The `Footer` component does not include a button to clear completed TODO items.
