# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Ensure that the API call to https://swapi.dev/api/people is made using axios.
**Pass**: The code uses `axios.get('https://swapi.dev/api/people/')` to make the API call.

### Step 2: Make sure the data is fetched initially without any input fields.
**Pass**: The data is fetched in the `useEffect` hook which runs on component mount, without any input fields.

### Step 3: Ensure a loader or loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass**: The code uses a `loading` state and conditionally renders a `<p>Loading...</p>` element while data is being fetched.

### Step 4: Verify that errors are logged to the console if the API call fails.
**Pass**: The code catches errors in the `axios` call and logs them using `console.error(error)`.

### Step 5: Ensure that the fetched characters are displayed in a list format.
**Pass**: The characters are displayed in a `<ul>` element with each character in a `<li>` element.

### Step 6: Make sure each list item has a unique key derived from the characterâ€™s URL.
**Pass**: Each `<li>` element uses `character.url` as the key, ensuring uniqueness.
