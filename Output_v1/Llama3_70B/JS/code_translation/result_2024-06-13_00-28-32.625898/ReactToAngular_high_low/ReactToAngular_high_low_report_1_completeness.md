# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Verify that all React components and their functionalities are correctly translated into Angular components.
**Pass**: The React components have been translated into Angular components. The `signup.component.ts` and `form-group.component.ts` files contain the necessary Angular component definitions.

### Step 2: Ensure that the form validation logic is implemented using Angular's reactive forms.
**Pass**: The form validation logic is implemented using Angular's reactive forms. The `FormGroup`, `FormControl`, and `Validators` are used in `signup.component.ts`.

### Step 3: Check that the application includes the necessary form controls and validation rules.
**Pass**: The application includes the necessary form controls (`name`, `email`, `password`) and validation rules (required and email validation).

### Step 4: Confirm that the application correctly binds the form controls and handles form submission.
**Pass**: The form controls are correctly bound using `formControlName`, and form submission is handled in the `onSubmit` method.

### Step 5: Ensure the application correctly displays form validation errors.
**Fail**: The `form-group.component.ts` does not correctly display form validation errors. The `field.error` should be `field.errors` and should iterate over the errors to display them.

### Step 6: Verify that the application contains actions for signup, signup success, and signup failure.
**Pass**: The `authActions` class contains a `signupComplete` method, which is used to handle signup success. However, there is no explicit action for signup failure.

### Step 7: Ensure that the auth.effects.ts file correctly handles side effects using @ngrx/effects, including calling the API and dispatching success or failure actions.
**Fail**: The provided code does not include an `auth.effects.ts` file. Therefore, it is not possible to verify if side effects are handled correctly using `@ngrx/effects`.

### Step 8: Validate that the API call to signup is correctly integrated and that the response is handled properly.
**Pass**: The API call to `signup` is correctly integrated in the `onSubmit` method, and the response is handled by dispatching the `signupComplete` action or setting form errors.

### Step 9: Confirm that the application navigates to the login page correctly when the link is clicked.
**Pass**: The application includes a router link to the login page using `routerLink="/login/"`.
