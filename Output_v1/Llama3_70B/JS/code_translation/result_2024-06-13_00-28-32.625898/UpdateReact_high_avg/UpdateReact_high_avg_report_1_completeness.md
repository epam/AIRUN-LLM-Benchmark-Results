# Evaluation Report

## Step-by-Step Evaluation

### Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
- **Pass**: The `TodoHeader.tsx` file contains an input field with an `onKeyDown` event handler that checks for the Enter key (keyCode 13) and dispatches the `addTodo` action with the current state value.

### Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include any filtering functionality. The `TodoList.tsx` file simply maps over all todos without considering any filters.

### Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include any functionality for toggling the completion status of all todos. The `toggleAll` action is defined in `todoSlice.ts`, but it is not used anywhere in the components.

### Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItem.tsx` file includes functionality for toggling (`handleToggle`), editing (`handleEdit`, `handleSave`), and deleting (`handleDestroy`) each todo item.

### Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItem.tsx` file includes an `onDoubleClick` event handler for starting the edit, an `onKeyDown` event handler for submitting (Enter key) and canceling (Esc key) the edit, and an `onBlur` event handler for saving the edit.

### Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
- **Fail**: The `TodoFooter.tsx` file displays the count of active items and includes a button for clearing completed items, but it does not include any filter functionality.

### Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFooter.tsx` file includes a button that calls the `clearCompleted` action to clear completed items.
