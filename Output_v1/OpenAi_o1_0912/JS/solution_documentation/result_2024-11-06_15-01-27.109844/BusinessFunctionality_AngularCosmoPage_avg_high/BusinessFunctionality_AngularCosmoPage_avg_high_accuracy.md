# Evaluation Report

**Evaluation Steps:**

1. **Ensure that the application uses `$resource` objects for RESTful API communication.**
   - **Pass**: The application utilizes AngularJS `$resource` to interact with a RESTful backend API for data persistence.

2. **Verify that the application saves page changes to local storage.**
   - **Pass**: The application automatically saves changes locally using `localStorage` to prevent data loss.

3. **Confirm that the application initializes the page type correctly.**
   - **Pass**: The application includes a dropdown selection for page type, tied to available theme pages.

4. **Validate that the application manages local storage for unsaved changes.**
   - **Pass**: The application checks for locally stored unsaved versions of a page and notifies the user, allowing them to restore or discard changes.

5. **Verify that the application handles errors during saving or updating pages.**
   - **Fail**: The provided answer does not explicitly mention error handling during saving or updating pages.

6. **Confirm that the application broadcasts events to update page variables and settings when necessary.**
   - **Fail**: The provided answer does not explicitly mention broadcasting events to update page variables and settings.

7. **Validate that the application uses promises and callbacks for asynchronous operations.**
   - **Pass**: The application utilizes asynchronous callbacks and promises to handle server responses without blocking the UI.

8. **Validate that the application broadcasts notifications for various operations (e.g., page saving, updating, deleting).**
   - **Fail**: The provided answer does not explicitly mention broadcasting notifications for various operations.

9. **Verify that the application supports scalability and maintainability through modular design.**
   - **Pass**: The application has a modular design with factories and controllers, allowing for easier maintenance and scaling.

10. **Confirm that the application optimizes performance through efficient API usage and local storage management.**
    - **Pass**: The application employs `$resource` for efficient RESTful communication and uses `localStorage` to reduce server load and increase responsiveness.

**Summary:**

- **Total number of steps evaluated**: 10
- **Number of passed steps**: 7
- **Number of failed steps**: 3

The application demonstrates strong functionality in terms of RESTful API communication, local storage management, and modular design. However, it lacks explicit details on error handling, event broadcasting, and notifications for various operations. These areas need to be addressed to ensure comprehensive functionality and robustness.
