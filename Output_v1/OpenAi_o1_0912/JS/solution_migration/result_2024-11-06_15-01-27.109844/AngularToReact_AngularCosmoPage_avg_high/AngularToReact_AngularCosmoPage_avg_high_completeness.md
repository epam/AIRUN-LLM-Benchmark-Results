# Evaluation Report

## Step 1: Confirm that the state slices for page and user are correctly defined and managed.

- **Pass**: The `pageSlice` and `userSlice` are correctly defined using `createSlice` from `@reduxjs/toolkit`. The initial states and reducers are properly set up to manage the state.

## Step 2: Verify that API service functions are correctly defined and used.

- **Pass**: The `rest.ts` file defines the API service functions using `axios`. The functions for content and content extras are correctly defined for CRUD operations.

## Step 3: Ensure that the application correctly handles all the functionalities from the original Angular code.

- **Pass**: The provided code includes components and slices that handle functionalities such as updating page details, managing tags, and handling user information. The components like `PageEditor`, `TagSuggestions`, `NewVersionNotification`, `BarTop`, and `BarActions` are implemented to manage these functionalities.

## Step 4: Verify that all functionalities like save, delete, update, and tag management are working correctly.

- **Fail**: The `handleSavePage` and `handleDeletePage` functions in `PageEditor.tsx` are not fully implemented. These functions need to be completed to ensure that save and delete operations work correctly.

## Step 5: Ensure that the application performs all CRUD operations correctly.

- **Fail**: As mentioned in Step 4, the save and delete operations are not fully implemented in the `PageEditor.tsx` component. This affects the ability to perform all CRUD operations correctly.

## Step 6: Verify that the application handles local storage and state persistence correctly.

- **Fail**: There is no implementation provided for handling local storage and state persistence. This needs to be addressed to ensure that the application can persist state across sessions.
