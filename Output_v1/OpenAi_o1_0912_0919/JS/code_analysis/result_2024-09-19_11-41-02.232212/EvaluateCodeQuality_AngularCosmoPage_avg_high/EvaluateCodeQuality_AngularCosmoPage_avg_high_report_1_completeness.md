# Evaluation Report

## Readability

### 1. Inconsistent and unclear variable naming conventions
**Pass**: The issue of inconsistent and unclear variable naming conventions was identified and a solution was provided to improve readability by renaming the service to `PageService` and using the `controllerAs` syntax.

### 2. Long controller functions with mixed responsibilities
**Pass**: The issue of long controller functions with mixed responsibilities was identified and a solution was provided to refactor the code by extracting business logic into services.

### 3. Lack of consistent and meaningful comments
**Pass**: The issue of lack of consistent and meaningful comments was identified and a solution was provided to add clear comments explaining the code's intent.

## Maintainability

### 1. Mixing of concerns within the controller
**Pass**: The issue of mixing concerns within the controller was identified and a solution was provided to separate concerns by moving business logic into services.

### 2. Hardcoded strings and magic numbers
**Pass**: The issue of hardcoded strings and magic numbers was identified and a solution was provided to define constants or configuration objects for fixed values.

## Performance

### 1. Inefficient use of `localStorage`
**Pass**: The issue of inefficient use of `localStorage` was identified and a solution was provided to check if data needs to be cleared and use `localStorage.removeItem` for clarity.

### 2. Unnecessary data binding in views
**Pass**: The issue of unnecessary data binding in views was identified and a solution was provided to use one-time bindings where appropriate.

## Accessibility

### 1. Missing labels and ARIA attributes
**Pass**: The issue of missing labels and ARIA attributes was identified and a solution was provided to associate labels with form controls and add ARIA attributes where necessary.

### 2. Inadequate contrast and lack of focus indicators
**Pass**: The issue of inadequate contrast and lack of focus indicators was identified and a solution was provided to ensure buttons have sufficient contrast and provide focus styles.

## Best Practices

### 1. Using `$scope` instead of `controllerAs` syntax
**Pass**: The issue of using `$scope` instead of `controllerAs` syntax was identified and a solution was provided to use `controllerAs` syntax.

### 2. Avoiding use of `ng-controller` in favor of components
**Pass**: The issue of using `ng-controller` was identified and a solution was provided to create a component for the page editor.

## Testing

### 1. Controller is hard to unit test due to dependencies and side effects
**Pass**: The issue of the controller being hard to unit test was identified and a solution was provided to inject dependencies and abstract side effects to make the controller more testable.

### 2. No unit tests are provided
**Pass**: The issue of no unit tests being provided was identified and a solution was provided to create unit tests for the controller using a testing framework like Jasmine.

## Documentation

### 1. Missing or unclear documentation for services and factories
**Pass**: The issue of missing or unclear documentation for services and factories was identified and a solution was provided to add JSDoc comments to explain each service and method.

### 2. Lack of documentation on controller usage in the HTML template
