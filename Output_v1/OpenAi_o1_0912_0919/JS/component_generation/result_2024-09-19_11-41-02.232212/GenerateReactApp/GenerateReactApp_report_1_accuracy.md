### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Pass**: Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.
   - The provided code does not contain any unused imports or code.

2. **Pass**: Ensure the codebase is structured and follows TypeScript and React best practices (state, hooks, effects).
   - The code uses `useState` and `useEffect` hooks appropriately and follows TypeScript best practices.

3. **Pass**: Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.
   - The `useEffect` hook is used correctly to fetch data once, preventing unnecessary re-renders.

4. **Pass**: Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.
   - The dependencies listed are compatible with the latest versions of React and TypeScript.

5. **Pass**: Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.
   - The code provided does not contain any console errors or warnings.

6. **Pass**: Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.
   - The application does not access DOM elements directly.

7. **Pass**: Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React’s virtual DOM.
   - The application does not manipulate the DOM directly.

8. **Pass**: Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React’s state and props.
   - The application does not use refs unnecessarily.

9. **Pass**: Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.
   - The state changes are managed efficiently, preventing unnecessary re-renders.

10. **Pass**: Ensure the code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility.
    - The code is simple and follows the single responsibility principle.

11. **Pass**: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
    - The code does not contain any duplicates and follows DRY principles.

12. **Pass**: App has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.
    - The DOM structure is consistent with the requirements.

13. **Pass**: App does correctly use useEffect, avoiding infinite loops.
    - The `useEffect` hook is used correctly, avoiding infinite loops.

14. **Pass**: Confirm that axios is installed and listed as a dependency in package.json.
    - `axios` is listed as a dependency in `package.json`.

15. **Pass**: Verify that the fetched data is stored in a state variable using the useState hook.
    - The fetched data is stored in a state variable using `useState`.

16. **Pass**: Verify that the code is optimized and does not contain any unnecessary parts or TODOs.
    - The code is optimized and does not contain unnecessary parts or TODOs.

17. **Pass**: Ensure that TypeScript is correctly integrated and used throughout the codebase.
    - TypeScript is correctly integrated and used throughout the codebase.

18. **Pass**: Verify that React.StrictMode is used in index.tsx.
    - React.StrictMode is used in `index.tsx`.
