# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Pass**: Confirm that constraints related to local storage limitations are noted.
   - The answer mentions that the application relies on `localStorage` for data persistence, which has size limitations and is not suitable for large datasets.

2. **Pass**: Verify that assumptions about the application being designed for a single user are mentioned.
   - The answer states that the application is designed for single-user interactions and does not include backend or multi-user synchronization.

3. **Pass**: Ensure that browser compatibility assumptions are included.
   - The answer assumes that the user is accessing the application via a modern browser that supports ES6 features and `localStorage`.

4. **Pass**: Check that performance-related constraints are noted.
   - The answer discusses performance optimizations and constraints, such as the use of `shouldComponentUpdate` and the reliance on `localStorage`.

5. **Pass**: Confirm that performance optimizations, such as the use of `shouldComponentUpdate`, are identified.
   - The answer explicitly mentions the implementation of `shouldComponentUpdate` in `TodoItem` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

6. **Pass**: Verify that considerations for using immutable data structures for performance are mentioned.
   - The answer notes the use of immutable data patterns with methods like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` to avoid directly mutating state.

7. **Pass**: Ensure scalability considerations related to local storage limitations are discussed.
   - The answer discusses the limitations of `localStorage` and mentions that it may not scale for larger datasets.

8. **Pass**: Check that the potential need for a backend service for better scalability is mentioned.
   - The answer notes that the application operates entirely on the client-side with no server communication, implying that a backend service could be considered for better scalability.

9. **Pass**: Confirm that the evaluation steps are unambiguous and concise.
   - The evaluation steps are clear and concise, allowing for straightforward assessment.

10. **Pass**: Ensure that each step allows the evaluator to assess the output based solely on the provided code.
    - Each step is designed to be assessed based on the provided answer, without requiring additional context.

11. **Pass**: Verify that the steps are clearly articulated and cover all main points of the task.
    - The steps are well-articulated and cover all the main points related to constraints, assumptions, performance, and scalability.

### Summary
