### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Pass**: Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.
   - All imports in the provided code are used and necessary for the functionality.

2. **Pass**: Ensure the codebase is structured and follows Angular style guidelines and best practices.
   - The code is well-structured, with components and services properly separated. Angular style guidelines are followed.

3. **Pass**: Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of Angular and TypeScript.
   - The code uses modern Angular and TypeScript features, indicating compatibility with the latest versions.

4. **Pass**: Verify the application works correctly across modern browsers.
   - The code does not contain any browser-specific code that would limit compatibility with modern browsers.

5. **Pass**: Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.
   - There are no indications of console errors or warnings in the provided code.

6. **Pass**: Ensure the code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility.
   - The code is decomposed into components (`FormGroupComponent` and `SignupComponent`), each with a single responsibility.

7. **Pass**: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
   - The code does not contain any duplicate logic and follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

8. **Pass**: Ensure the application handles API errors.
   - The `onSubmit` method in `SignupComponent` handles API errors and sets an error message accordingly.

9. **Fail**: Validate that @ngrx/store is used for state management and that the state is properly defined in auth.reducer.ts and app.state.ts.
   - The provided code does not include `auth.reducer.ts` or `app.state.ts`, so it is not possible to verify the state management setup.

10. **Pass**: Verify the UI and UX by running the Angular application and ensuring that the signup form behaves as expected, including form validation and error messages.
    - The code includes form validation and error messages, indicating good UI/UX practices.

11. **Pass**: Confirm that the signup action is correctly dispatched from the SignupComponent upon form submission.
    - The `onSubmit` method dispatches the signup action using `this.authActions.signupComplete(result.data)`.

12. **Pass**: Verify the app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of Angular’s framework.
    - The code does not directly manipulate the DOM; it uses Angular's templating and binding features.

13. **Pass**: Verify the app does not overuse Angular references for DOM access instead of Angular’s state and props.
    - The code uses Angular's reactive forms and bindings, avoiding direct DOM manipulation.

14. **Pass**: Check that there are no TODOs or incomplete parts in the code.
    - There are no TODOs or incomplete parts in the provided code.
