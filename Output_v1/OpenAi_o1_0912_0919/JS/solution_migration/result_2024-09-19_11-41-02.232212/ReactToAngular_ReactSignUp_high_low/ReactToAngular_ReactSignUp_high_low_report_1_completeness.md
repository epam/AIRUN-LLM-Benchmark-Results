# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Verify that all React components and their functionalities are correctly translated into Angular components.**
   - **Pass**: The provided code includes Angular components (`FormGroupComponent` and `SignupComponent`) that replicate the functionalities of the React components.

2. **Ensure that the form validation logic is implemented using Angular's reactive forms.**
   - **Pass**: The `SignupComponent` uses Angular's reactive forms (`FormBuilder`, `FormGroup`, `Validators`) to implement form validation logic.

3. **Check that the application includes the necessary form controls and validation rules.**
   - **Pass**: The `signupForm` includes form controls for `name`, `email`, and `password` with appropriate validation rules (e.g., `Validators.required`, `Validators.minLength`, `Validators.email`).

4. **Confirm that the application correctly binds the form controls and handles form submission.**
   - **Pass**: The form controls are correctly bound using `formControlName` in the template, and the `onSubmit` method handles form submission.

5. **Ensure the application correctly displays form validation errors.**
   - **Pass**: The `FormGroupComponent` displays validation errors using the `errorMessage` getter, which retrieves error messages based on the validation errors present.

6. **Verify that the application contains actions for signup, signup success, and signup failure.**
   - **Pass**: The `onSubmit` method in `SignupComponent` dispatches the `signupComplete` action on successful signup and handles errors by setting `errorMessage`.

7. **Ensure that the auth.effects.ts file correctly handles side effects using @ngrx/effects, including calling the API and dispatching success or failure actions.**
   - **Fail**: The provided code does not include the `auth.effects.ts` file or any implementation details related to handling side effects using `@ngrx/effects`.

8. **Validate that the API call to signup is correctly integrated and that the response is handled properly.**
   - **Pass**: The `onSubmit` method makes an API call to `signup` using the `ApiService` and handles the response by dispatching actions and navigating on success or setting an error message on failure.

9. **Confirm that the application navigates to the login page correctly when the link is clicked.**
   - **Pass**: The template includes a router link (`routerLink="/login"`) that navigates to the login page when clicked.
