# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Confirm that the application initializes correctly and loads persisted todos.
- **Pass**: The `AppComponent` dispatches the `LoadTodos` action on initialization, and the `TodoEffects` class handles loading todos from `localStorage`.

### Step 2: Ensure that the todo list displays correctly and is interactive.
- **Pass**: The `TodoListComponent` subscribes to the todos from the store and displays them using the `todo-list.component.html` template.

### Step 3: Verify that adding a new todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `addTodo` method in `TodoListComponent` dispatches the `AddTodo` action, and the `todoReducer` handles adding the new todo to the state.

### Step 4: Check that editing a todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `editTodo`, `doneEditing`, and `revertEditing` methods in `TodoItemComponent` handle the editing logic, and the `UpdateTodo` action is dispatched to update the state.

### Step 5: Confirm that toggling a todo itemâ€™s completion status works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `toggle` method in `TodoItemComponent` dispatches the `UpdateTodo` action to toggle the completion status of a todo.

### Step 6: Ensure that removing a todo works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `removeTodo` method in `TodoItemComponent` dispatches the `RemoveTodo` action to remove a todo from the state.

### Step 7: Verify that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works.
- **Pass**: The `markAll` method in `TodoListComponent` dispatches the `ToggleAll` action to mark all todos as complete or incomplete.

### Step 8: Check that the filter functionality (All, Active, Completed) works.
- **Pass**: The `ngOnInit` method in `TodoListComponent` subscribes to route fragments and dispatches the `SetFilter` action to update the filter in the state. The `getTodos` selector filters the todos based on the current filter.

### Step 9: Confirm that the "Clear completed" button works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `clearCompleted` method in `TodoListComponent` dispatches the `ClearCompleted` action to remove all completed todos from the state.

### Step 10: Ensure that the application is responsive and functions correctly on different screen sizes.
- **Pass**: The application uses the `todomvc-common/base.css` and `todomvc-app-css/index.css` stylesheets, which are designed to be responsive.
