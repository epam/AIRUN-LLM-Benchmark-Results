**Pass**: The `Piano` component includes a button container with "Notes" and "Letters" buttons.

### Step 2: Verify the application renders piano keys for both natural and sharp notes.
**Pass**: The `Piano` component renders both white (natural) and black (sharp) keys using the `PianoKey` component.

### Step 3: Verify clicking on a piano key plays the correct sound and highlights the key.
**Pass**: The `Piano` component's `playNote` function plays the correct sound and updates the `activeKeys` state to highlight the key.

### Step 4: Verify releasing the mouse button or moving the cursor out of the key stops the sound and removes the highlight.
**Pass**: The `Piano` component's `stopNote` function stops the sound and updates the `activeKeys` state to remove the highlight. The `handleMouseUpOnKey` and `handleMouseOut` functions handle these events.

### Step 5: Verify pressing and releasing keyboard keys play and stop the corresponding piano notes.
**Pass**: The `handleKeyDown` and `handleKeyUp` functions in the `Piano` component handle keyboard events to play and stop the corresponding piano notes.

### Step 6: Verify clicking the "Notes" button displays note names on the keys.

### Step 7: Verify clicking the "Letters" button displays letter names on the keys.
**Pass**: The `isLetters` state in the `Piano` component toggles between displaying note names and letter names on the keys. The "Letters" button sets `isLetters` to `true`.
