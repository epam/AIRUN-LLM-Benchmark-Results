# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Confirm that unit tests are written for the signup.js file.**
   - **Pass**: Unit tests are present for the `Signup` component in `__tests__/signup.test.js`.

2. **Ensure that unit tests are written for the form.js file.**
   - **Pass**: Unit tests are present for the `FormGroup` component in `__tests__/form.test.js`.

3. **Ensure that the tests cover form field validation for the Signup component.**
   - **Pass**: The `validate` function is tested for both valid and invalid inputs.

4. **Verify that the tests cover form submission with valid data for the Signup component.**
   - **Pass**: The test `handleSubmit calls api.signup and dispatches signupComplete` covers form submission with valid data.

5. **Ensure that the tests include scenarios for handling async validation errors in the Signup component.**
   - **Pass**: The test `handleSubmit handles api.signup error` covers scenarios for handling async validation errors.

6. **Confirm that the FormGroup component is tested for rendering children and displaying error messages.**
   - **Pass**: The test `shows error style and displays error message when field is touched and has error` covers this scenario.

7. **Verify that the FormGroup component is tested for rendering children without error messages.**
   - **Pass**: The test `does not display feedback when field is untouched` covers this scenario.

8. **Check that all PropTypes are validated in the tests.**
   - **Fail**: The tests do not explicitly check for PropTypes validation.

9. **Ensure that the tests are passing without any errors.**
   - **Pass**: The provided tests do not show any errors in the code snippets.

10. **Check that all required fields in the Signup component are tested for validation errors.**
    - **Pass**: The `validate` function tests for validation errors for `name`, `email`, and `password`.

11. **Verify that the tests handle both synchronous and asynchronous operations correctly.**
    - **Pass**: The tests for `handleSubmit` and `asyncValidate` handle both synchronous and asynchronous operations.

12. **Ensure that the tests include edge cases for form input values (e.g., minimum and maximum length for name, invalid email format).**
    - **Pass**: The `validate` function tests include edge cases for invalid input values.

### Summary

- **Total Steps Evaluated**: 12
- **Number of Passed Steps**: 11
- **Number of Failed Steps**: 1

Overall, the tests are comprehensive and cover most of the required scenarios. However, explicit validation of PropTypes in the tests is missing.
