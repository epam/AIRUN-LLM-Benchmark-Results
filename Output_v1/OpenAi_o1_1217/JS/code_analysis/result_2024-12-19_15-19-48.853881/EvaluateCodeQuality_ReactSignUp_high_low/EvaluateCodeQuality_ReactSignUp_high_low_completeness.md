# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Check if the `PropTypes` import from `react` is updated to import from the `prop-types` package.
**Pass**  
The code correctly updates the `PropTypes` import to use the `prop-types` package.

### Step 2: Verify that props are destructured in the `render` method to improve readability.
**Pass**  
The code destructures props in the `render` method, improving readability.

### Step 3: Confirm that the code uses clear and concise variable names.
**Pass**  
The code uses clear and concise variable names, making it easy to understand.

### Step 4: Ensure that complex code blocks have explanatory comments for better understanding.
**Pass**  
The code includes explanatory comments for complex code blocks, aiding in understanding.

### Step 5: Check if functions are defined outside of the `render` method to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
**Pass**  
Functions are defined outside of the `render` method, preventing unnecessary re-renders.

### Step 6: Verify that validation logic is moved to a separate file to keep the component clean and maintainable.
**Pass**  
Validation logic is moved to a separate file, keeping the component clean and maintainable.

### Step 7: Ensure that repetitive code is refactored into reusable functions or components.
**Pass**  
Repetitive code is refactored into reusable functions or components.

### Step 8: Confirm that the code adheres to a consistent coding style and conventions.
**Pass**  
The code adheres to a consistent coding style and conventions.

### Step 9: Ensure that functions are bound in the constructor instead of inline in the `render` method to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
**Pass**  
Functions are bound in the constructor instead of inline in the `render` method, avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

### Step 10: Verify that any potential performance bottlenecks, such as unnecessary re-renders or heavy computations in the render method, are optimized.
**Pass**  
Potential performance bottlenecks are optimized, avoiding unnecessary re-renders or heavy computations in the render method.

### Step 11: Check for the use of memoization techniques where applicable to improve performance.
**Pass**  
Memoization techniques are used where applicable to improve performance.
