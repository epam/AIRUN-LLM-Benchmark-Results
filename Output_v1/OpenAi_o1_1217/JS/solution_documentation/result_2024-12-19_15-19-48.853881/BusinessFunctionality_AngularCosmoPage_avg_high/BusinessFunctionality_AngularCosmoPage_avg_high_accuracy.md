# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### 1. Ensure that the application uses `$resource` objects for RESTful API communication.
**Pass**: The provided analysis confirms that the REST factory (in rest.js) defines multiple `$resource` endpoints for basic CRUD actions.

### 2. Verify that the application saves page changes to local storage.
**Pass**: The analysis mentions that `pageCtrl.js` stores unsaved form data in `localStorage`.

### 3. Confirm that the application initializes the page type correctly.
**Pass**: The analysis indicates that the application handles both brand-new pages (via `/new` route) and updates to existing pages.

### 4. Validate that the application manages local storage for unsaved changes.
**Pass**: The analysis describes how the system detects unsaved “newerVersion” of the page and allows users to load, discard, or compare differences.

### 5. Verify that the application handles errors during saving or updating pages.
**Fail**: The analysis does not explicitly mention error handling during saving or updating pages.

### 6. Confirm that the application broadcasts events to update page variables and settings when necessary.
**Fail**: The analysis does not provide information on whether the application broadcasts events to update page variables and settings.

### 7. Validate that the application uses promises and callbacks for asynchronous operations.
**Fail**: The analysis does not mention the use of promises and callbacks for asynchronous operations.

### 8. Validate that the application broadcasts notifications for various operations (e.g., page saving, updating, deleting).
**Pass**: The analysis mentions that notification messages (success or error) guide users and ensure clarity about the result of each action.

### 9. Verify that the application supports scalability and maintainability through modular design.
**Pass**: The analysis indicates that the architecture is straightforward and supports scaling at the backend level.

### 10. Confirm that the application optimizes performance through efficient API usage and local storage management.
**Pass**: The analysis mentions that the application uses local storage for unsaved drafts and limits tag suggestions to avoid performance issues.
