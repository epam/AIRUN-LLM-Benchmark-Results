- **Pass**: All imports are used in the code.

### Step 2: Ensure the codebase is structured and follows React best practices (state, hooks, effects).
- **Pass**: The codebase is well-structured and follows React best practices, including the use of hooks and effects.

### Step 3: Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.
- **Pass**: The application appears to be free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.

### Step 4: Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.
- **Pass**: The application uses React 18.x and TypeScript.

### Step 5: Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.
- **Pass**: There are no apparent console errors or warnings in the provided code.

### Step 6: Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.
- **Pass**: The app uses React state to manage form values instead of directly accessing DOM elements.

### Step 7: Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React virtual DOM.
- **Pass**: The app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React's virtual DOM.

### Step 8: Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React state and props.
- **Pass**: The app uses React state and props appropriately and does not overuse refs.

### Step 9: Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.
- **Pass**: The app appears to manage state and props efficiently, avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

### Step 10: Ensure the code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility.
- **Pass**: The code is decomposed into components that follow the single responsibility principle.

### Step 11: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
- **Pass**: The code follows DRY principles and does not contain unnecessary duplicates.

### Step 12: App does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.
- **Pass**: This step is a duplicate of Step 6 and has already been evaluated as Pass.

### Step 13: App has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.
- **Pass**: The provided code maintains the same DOM tree structure and classes as the original application.
