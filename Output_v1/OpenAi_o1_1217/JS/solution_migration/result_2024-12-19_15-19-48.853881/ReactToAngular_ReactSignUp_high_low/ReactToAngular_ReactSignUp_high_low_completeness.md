### Step 3: Check that the application includes the necessary form controls and validation rules.

### Step 4: Confirm that the application correctly binds the form controls and handles form submission.
- **Pass**: The form controls are correctly bound using `formControlName` and the form submission is handled by the `onSubmit` method in `SignupComponent`.

### Step 5: Ensure the application correctly displays form validation errors.

### Step 6: Verify that the application contains actions for signup, signup success, and signup failure.
- **Pass**: The `auth.actions.ts` file contains actions for `signUp`, `signUpSuccess`, and `signUpFailure`.

### Step 7: Ensure that the `auth.effects.ts` file correctly handles side effects using @ngrx/effects, including calling the API and dispatching success or failure actions.
- **Pass**: The `AuthEffects` class in `auth.effects.ts` correctly handles side effects using `@ngrx/effects`, including calling the API and dispatching `signUpSuccess` or `signUpFailure` actions.

### Step 8: Validate that the API call to signup is correctly integrated and that the response is handled properly.
- **Pass**: The `ApiService` class includes the `signup` method which makes the API call, and the response is handled properly in the `AuthEffects` class.
