# Evaluation Report

## Step 1: Verify that there is an input field for creating a new todo. The creation should occur when the Enter key is pressed, and the value should be taken from the state and dispatched to the store.
**Pass**: The `App.tsx` file contains an input field with the class name `new-todo`. The `handleNewTodoKeyDown` function handles the Enter key press event, dispatches the `addTodo` action, and clears the input field.

## Step 2: Ensure that todo items are displayed in a list according to the current filter.
**Pass**: The `App.tsx` file filters the todos based on the current filter (`ALL_TODOS`, `ACTIVE_TODOS`, `COMPLETED_TODOS`) and passes the filtered list to the `TodoList` component.

## Step 3: Ensure there is functionality that allows toggling the completion status of all todos.
**Pass**: The `App.tsx` file contains a checkbox with the id `toggle-all` that, when changed, dispatches the `toggleAll` action to toggle the completion status of all todos.

## Step 4: Verify that each todo item can be toggled, edited, or deleted.
**Pass**: The `TodoItem.tsx` file includes functionality to toggle (`toggleTodo`), edit (`saveTodo`), and delete (`removeTodo`) each todo item.

## Step 5: Ensure that editing a todo starts with a double click, submitting a todo occurs by pressing Enter, and clicking the Esc button resets the current editing to the initial value.
**Pass**: The `TodoItem.tsx` file handles double-click to start editing, Enter key to submit changes, and Esc key to reset the editing state.

## Step 6: Ensure that the footer of the application displays the count of active items, has filter functionality, and allows clearing completed items.
**Pass**: The `TodoFooter.tsx` file displays the count of active items, includes filter links, and a button to clear completed items.

## Step 7: Ensure that the footer includes a button to clear completed TODO items, which dispatches the corresponding action.
**Pass**: The `TodoFooter.tsx` file includes a button with the class name `clear-completed` that, when clicked, dispatches the `clearCompleted` action.
