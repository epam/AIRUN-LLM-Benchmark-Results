# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that a loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass**: The code sets `loading` to `true` before fetching data and displays a loading indicator when `loading` is `true`.

### Step 2: Verify that the loader does not hide the search input when data is loading.
**Pass**: The search input is always displayed regardless of the loading state.

### Step 3: Validate that a request with an empty search term is sent on the initial render.
**Pass**: On initial render, `searchTerm` is an empty string, and a request is sent with an empty search term.

### Step 4: Verify that the search input field is present.
**Pass**: The search input field is present in the JSX.

### Step 5: Ensure that the character search functionality is implemented.
**Pass**: The search functionality is implemented by updating `searchTerm` and fetching data based on the search term.

### Step 6: Ensure that the API request includes the search term as a query parameter.
**Pass**: The API request includes the search term as a query parameter using `params: { search: searchTerm }`.

### Step 7: Validate that the data is loading on initial app load with empty query and then when the search term changes.
**Pass**: Data is fetched on initial load with an empty query and whenever the `searchTerm` changes.

### Step 8: Ensure that the debounced fetch function prevents unnecessary API requests.
**Pass**: The fetch function is debounced using `setTimeout` with a delay of 500ms.

### Step 9: Confirm that the character list is updated based on the search results.
**Pass**: The character list is updated based on the search results by setting `characters` state.

### Step 10: Validate that the application handles API request errors.
**Pass**: API request errors are handled by catching the error and logging it to the console.

### Step 11: Ensure that the user experience remains smooth without backend overloads.
**Pass**: The debounced fetch function and loading indicator ensure a smooth user experience without backend overloads.
