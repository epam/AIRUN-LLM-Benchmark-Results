# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that the main component displays the header with input for new todos.
- **Pass**: The `app.component.html` contains a header with an input field for new todos.

### Step 2: Ensure that adding a new todo item works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `AppComponent` handles the `keydown` event on the input field and dispatches the `addTodo` action to add a new todo item.

### Step 3: Verify that the todo list displays all added todo items.
- **Pass**: The `AppComponent` subscribes to the `todos$` observable and uses `*ngFor` to display each todo item in the list.

### Step 4: Confirm that toggle functionality works for marking todos as completed.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItemComponent` dispatches the `toggleTodo` action when the checkbox is changed, and the reducer updates the todo's completed status.

### Step 5: Check that editing a todo item works and updates the todo item correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItemComponent` handles editing, submitting, and dispatching the `saveTodo` action to update the todo item.

### Step 6: Ensure that deleting a todo item removes it from the list.
- **Pass**: The `TodoItemComponent` dispatches the `deleteTodo` action when the delete button is clicked, and the reducer removes the todo item from the list.

### Step 7: Verify that the footer correctly displays the count of active items.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFooterComponent` displays the count of active items using the `count` input property and the `activeTodoWord` getter.

### Step 8: Confirm that the footer's clear completed button works and removes completed items.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFooterComponent` emits the `clearCompleted` event, which the `AppComponent` handles by dispatching the `clearCompleted` action.

### Step 9: Check that filtering todos by "all", "active", and "completed" works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `TodoFooterComponent` dispatches the `setFilter` action, and the selectors filter the todos based on the current filter.

### Step 10: Ensure that the "Mark all as complete" functionality works correctly.
- **Pass**: The `AppComponent` dispatches the `toggleAllTodos` action when the "Mark all as complete" checkbox is changed, and the reducer updates all todos' completed status.

### Step 11: Check that the application persists todos to local storage and reloads them correctly.
- **Pass**: The `Utils.store` method handles storing and retrieving todos from local storage, and the initial state of the `TodoState` is loaded from local storage.
