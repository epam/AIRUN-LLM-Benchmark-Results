# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Ensure that the API call to https://swapi.dev/api/people is made using axios.
**Pass**: The API call is made using axios in the `fetchCharacters` function within the `useEffect` hook in `src/App.tsx`.

### Step 2: Make sure the data is fetched initially without any input fields.
**Pass**: The data is fetched initially without any input fields. The `useEffect` hook is used to fetch data when the component mounts.

### Step 3: Ensure a loader or loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass**: A loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched. The `loading` state is used to conditionally render a loader (`<div className="loader">Loading...</div>`) in `src/App.tsx`.

### Step 4: Verify that errors are logged to the console if the API call fails.
**Fail**: Errors are not logged to the console if the API call fails. The catch block in the `fetchCharacters` function sets the characters to an empty array but does not log the error.

### Step 5: Ensure that the fetched characters are displayed in a list format.
**Pass**: The fetched characters are displayed in a list format. The characters are mapped to `<li>` elements within a `<ul>` in `src/App.tsx`.

### Step 6: Make sure each list item has a unique key derived from the character’s URL.
**Pass**: Each list item has a unique key derived from the character’s URL. The `key` attribute is set to `character.url` in the map function.
