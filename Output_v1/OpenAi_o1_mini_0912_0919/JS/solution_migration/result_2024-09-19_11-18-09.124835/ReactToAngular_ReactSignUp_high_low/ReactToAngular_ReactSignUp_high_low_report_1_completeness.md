# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Verify that all React components and their functionalities are correctly translated into Angular components.
- **Pass**: The provided code includes Angular components (`FormGroupComponent` and `SignupComponent`) that replace the React components. The functionalities are correctly translated.

### Step 2: Ensure that the form validation logic is implemented using Angular's reactive forms.
- **Pass**: The `SignupComponent` uses Angular's reactive forms (`FormBuilder`, `FormGroup`, `Validators`) to implement form validation logic.

### Step 3: Check that the application includes the necessary form controls and validation rules.
- **Pass**: The form controls (`name`, `email`, `password`) and their validation rules (e.g., `Validators.required`, `Validators.minLength`, `Validators.maxLength`, `Validators.email`) are correctly included in the `SignupComponent`.

### Step 4: Confirm that the application correctly binds the form controls and handles form submission.
- **Pass**: The form controls are correctly bound using `formControlName` in the template, and the form submission is handled by the `onSubmit` method in the `SignupComponent`.

### Step 5: Ensure the application correctly displays form validation errors.
- **Pass**: The `FormGroupComponent` template includes logic to display validation errors based on the form control's state (`field.invalid`, `field.touched`, `field.errors`).

### Step 6: Verify that the application contains actions for signup, signup success, and signup failure.
- **Pass**: The `onSubmit` method in the `SignupComponent` dispatches the `AuthActions.signupComplete` action upon successful signup. Error handling is mentioned but not fully implemented in the provided code.

### Step 7: Ensure that the auth.effects.ts file correctly handles side effects using @ngrx/effects, including calling the API and dispatching success or failure actions.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include the `auth.effects.ts` file or any implementation details for handling side effects using `@ngrx/effects`.

### Step 8: Validate that the API call to signup is correctly integrated and that the response is handled properly.
- **Pass**: The `onSubmit` method in the `SignupComponent` makes an API call to `this.api.signup` and handles the response by dispatching the `AuthActions.signupComplete` action.

### Step 9: Confirm that the application navigates to the login page correctly when the link is clicked.
- **Pass**: The template includes a router link (`[routerLink]="['/login']"`) that navigates to the login page when clicked.
