# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### 1. Confirm the use of `string` instead of `String` for type annotations in TypeScript.
**Pass**: The provided code examples use `string` for type annotations, which is the correct and recommended practice in TypeScript.

### 2. Ensure the avoidance of the `any` type and use of more specific types.
**Pass**: The code examples replace `any` with more specific types, such as `HTMLInputElement`.

### 3. Check for consistent use of functional components where applicable.
**Fail**: The provided examples do not mention or demonstrate the use of functional components. The focus is on class components.

### 4. Verify that the code adheres to the principles of immutability.
**Pass**: The code examples show the use of immutable patterns, such as using `concat` to add new items to arrays.

**Pass**: The report includes an example of a unit test for the `TodoModel` class using Jest.

### 6. Verify that functions and methods are easily testable with clear inputs and outputs.
**Pass**: The provided examples show methods with clear inputs and outputs, making them easily testable.

### 7. Confirm the presence of test cases for different scenarios, including edge cases.
**Fail**: The report includes only a single test case example. It does not cover different scenarios or edge cases.

### 8. Ensure the presence of comments explaining the purpose and functionality of complex code blocks.
**Pass**: The examples include comments explaining the purpose and functionality of the code.

### 9. Verify that JSDoc comments are added to all functions and methods.
