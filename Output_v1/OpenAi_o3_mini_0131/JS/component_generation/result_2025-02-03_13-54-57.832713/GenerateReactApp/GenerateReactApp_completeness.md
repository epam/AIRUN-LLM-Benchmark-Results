# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Ensure that the API call to https://swapi.dev/api/people is made using axios.
**Pass**: The API call is made using axios in the `fetchCharacters` function within the `useEffect` hook.
```typescript
const { data } = await axios.get('https://swapi.dev/api/people?search=');
```

### Step 2: Make sure the data is fetched initially without any input fields.
**Pass**: The data is fetched initially without any input fields. The `useEffect` hook is used to fetch data when the component mounts.
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchCharacters = async () => {
    // API call
  };
  fetchCharacters();
}, []);
```

### Step 3: Ensure a loader or loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass**: A loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
```typescript
if (loading) {
  return <div>Loading...</div>;
}
```

### Step 4: Verify that errors are logged to the console if the API call fails.
**Fail**: Errors are not logged to the console if the API call fails. The error is caught, and the `characters` state is set to an empty array, but there is no `console.error` statement.
```typescript
catch (error) {
  setCharacters([]);
  // Missing console.error(error);
}
```

### Step 5: Ensure that the fetched characters are displayed in a list format.
**Pass**: The fetched characters are displayed in a list format using an unordered list (`<ul>`).
```typescript
<ul>
  {characters.map((character) => (
    <li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

### Step 6: Make sure each list item has a unique key derived from the character URL.
**Pass**: Each list item has a unique key derived from the character URL.
```typescript
<li key={character.url}>{character.name}</li>
```
