# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that a loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass**: The code sets `loading` to `true` before making the API request and displays a "Loading..." message when `loading` is `true`.

### Step 2: Verify that the loader does not hide the search input when data is loading.
**Pass**: The search input field is always rendered, regardless of the `loading` state.

### Step 3: Validate that a request with an empty search term is sent on the initial render.
**Pass**: On initial render, `search` is an empty string, and the API request is made with `search` as an empty query parameter.

### Step 4: Verify that the search input field is present.
**Pass**: The search input field is present in the JSX and is rendered correctly.

### Step 5: Ensure that the character search functionality is implemented.
**Pass**: The search functionality is implemented by updating the `search` state and making an API request with the search term.

### Step 6: Ensure that the API request includes the search term as a query parameter.
**Pass**: The API request URL includes the search term as a query parameter using `encodeURIComponent(search)`.

### Step 7: Validate that the data is loading on initial app load with empty query and then when the search term changes.
**Pass**: The data is fetched on initial load with an empty query and whenever the `search` term changes.

### Step 8: Ensure that the debounced fetch function prevents unnecessary API requests.
**Pass**: The `setTimeout` with a 500ms delay ensures that the fetch function is debounced, preventing unnecessary API requests.

### Step 9: Confirm that the character list is updated based on the search results.
**Pass**: The character list is updated based on the search results by setting the `characters` state with the fetched data.

### Step 10: Validate that the application handles API request errors.
**Pass**: The application handles API request errors by catching them and logging an error message to the console.

### Step 11: Ensure that the user experience remains smooth without backend overloads.
**Pass**: The debounced fetch function and the loading indicator ensure a smooth user experience without overloading the backend.
