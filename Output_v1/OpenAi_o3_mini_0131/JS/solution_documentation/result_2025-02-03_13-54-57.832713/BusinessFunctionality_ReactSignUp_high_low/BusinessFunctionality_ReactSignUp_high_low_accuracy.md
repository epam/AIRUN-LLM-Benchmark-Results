## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Confirm the validation rules, such as name length, valid email address, and minimum password length.
**Pass**: The code enforces validation rules for name length (3-60 characters), valid email format, and minimum password length (6 characters).

### Step 2: Verify the existence of API endpoints (`api.isName`, `api.isEmail`, `api.signup`) for validation and signup processes.
**Pass**: The code references `api.isName`, `api.isEmail`, and `api.signup` for asynchronous validation and signup processes.

### Step 3: Check the use of `redux-form` for managing form state and validation.
**Pass**: The code utilizes `redux-form` to manage form state and validation effectively.

### Step 4: Ensure the presence of UI components from `react-bootstrap` and custom components like `FormGroup` and `Icon`.
**Pass**: The code includes UI components from `react-bootstrap` and custom components such as `FormGroup` and `Icon`.

### Step 5: Confirm that asynchronous validation is performed in parallel using `Promise.all`.
**Pass**: The code performs asynchronous validation in parallel using `Promise.all`.

### Step 6: Verify the efficient management of form state with `redux-form`.
**Pass**: The code efficiently manages form state using `redux-form`.

### Step 7: Check if the code handles errors gracefully by providing user feedback.
**Pass**: The code provides user feedback for errors, ensuring a user-friendly experience.

### Step 8: Verify the use of reusable components like `FormGroup` and `Icon` to promote code maintainability.
