# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Confirm that the state slices for page and user are correctly defined and managed.
- **Pass**: The `pageSlice` and `usersSlice` are correctly defined using `createSlice` from `@reduxjs/toolkit`. The initial states and reducers are properly set up to manage the state.

### Step 2: Verify that API service functions are correctly defined and used.
- **Pass**: The `restAPI` object in `restAPI.ts` contains all necessary API service functions for content, content revisions, content extras, and content tags. These functions are correctly defined using `axios`.

### Step 3: Ensure that the application correctly handles all the functionalities from the original Angular code.
- **Pass**: The `PageEditor` component handles functionalities such as saving, updating, deleting, and managing tags. The component also manages local storage and state persistence.

### Step 4: Verify that all functionalities like save, delete, update, and tag management are working correctly.
- **Pass**: The `PageEditor` component includes methods for saving (`savePage`), deleting (`deletePage`), and updating content. Tag management is handled through `handleTagsChange` and `autocompleteTags`.

### Step 5: Ensure that the application performs all CRUD operations correctly.
- **Pass**: The `restAPI` functions for CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) are correctly used in the `PageEditor` component. The component calls these functions appropriately based on user actions.

### Step 6: Verify that the application handles local storage and state persistence correctly.
- **Pass**: The `PageEditor` component includes logic to save and retrieve data from local storage. The `useEffect` hook checks for newer versions of the page data in local storage and updates the state accordingly.
