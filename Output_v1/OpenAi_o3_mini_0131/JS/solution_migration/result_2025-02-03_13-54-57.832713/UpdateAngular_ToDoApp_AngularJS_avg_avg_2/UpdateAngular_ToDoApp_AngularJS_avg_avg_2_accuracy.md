   - All imports in the provided code are used and necessary for the functionality.

2. **Pass**: Ensure the codebase is structured and follows Angular style guidelines and best practices.
   - The codebase is well-structured, with components, services, and state management properly organized.

3. **Pass**: Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of Angular and TypeScript.
   - The code uses Angular 14 and TypeScript, ensuring compatibility with the latest versions.

4. **Pass**: Verify the application works correctly across modern browsers.
   - The code does not contain any browser-specific code that would limit compatibility with modern browsers.

5. **Pass**: Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.
   - The code does not contain any obvious errors or warnings that would appear in the console.

6. **Pass**: Ensure the code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility.
   - The code is decomposed into multiple components, each handling a specific part of the application.

7. **Pass**: Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles.
   - The code follows DRY principles and does not contain any unnecessary duplication.

8. **Pass**: Check that @ngrx/store is used for state management.
   - The code uses @ngrx/store for state management, as seen in the `StoreModule` and `todoReducer`.

9. **Pass**: Check that @ngrx/effects is used for handling side effects.
   - The code uses @ngrx/effects for handling side effects, as seen in the `EffectsModule` and `TodoEffects`.

10. **Pass**: Confirm that the code is split into separate components.
    - The code is split into separate components such as `TodoInputComponent`, `TodoListComponent`, and `TodoFooterComponent`.

11. **Fail**: Ensure that localStorage is used for persisting todos via a service.
    - LocalStorage is used directly in the `TodoEffects` class instead of through a dedicated service.

12. **Pass**: Check that state management actions and reducers are correctly implemented.
    - The actions and reducers are correctly implemented and follow best practices.

13. **Pass**: Verify that effects are correctly implemented to handle side effects.

    - The application structure adheres to Angular style guidelines, with a clear separation of concerns.

17. **Pass**: Verify App does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.
    - The application uses Angular's data binding to retrieve values from text fields instead of directly accessing DOM elements.

18. **Pass**: Verify App does not make API calls.
    - The application does not make any API calls.

19. **Pass**: Verify App has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.
