### Step 1: Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.
- **Pass**: All imports and code are used appropriately within the application.

### Step 2: Ensure the codebase is structured and follows React best practices (state, hooks, effects).
- **Pass**: The codebase is well-structured, using functional components, hooks, and effects correctly.

### Step 3: Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.
- **Pass**: The use of `useEffect` for adding and removing event listeners is correct, preventing memory leaks. The use of `useRef` and `useState` is appropriate to manage state and references.

### Step 4: Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.
- **Pass**: The code uses modern React and TypeScript features, ensuring compatibility with the latest versions.

### Step 5: Verify the application works correctly across modern browsers.
- **Pass**: The code does not contain any browser-specific features that would prevent it from working across modern browsers.

### Step 6: Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.
- **Pass**: The code does not contain any obvious issues that would result in console errors or warnings.

### Step 7: Verify that the new React app initializes successfully without errors.
- **Pass**: The initialization code in `src/index.tsx` is correct and should initialize the app without errors.

### Step 8: Verify that the codebase does not contain any TODOs.
- **Pass**: The codebase does not contain any TODO comments.

### Step 9: Ensure the application has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.
- **Pass**: The DOM structure and classes in the React components match the original HTML structure.

### Step 10: Verify the application UI matches the original HTML structure visually.
- **Pass**: The CSS and component structure ensure that the UI matches the original HTML structure visually.

### Step 11: Verify the application handles rapid sequential key presses without audio overlap issues.
- **Pass**: The `genericPlay` function resets the `currentTime` of the audio element, preventing audio overlap issues during rapid key presses.
