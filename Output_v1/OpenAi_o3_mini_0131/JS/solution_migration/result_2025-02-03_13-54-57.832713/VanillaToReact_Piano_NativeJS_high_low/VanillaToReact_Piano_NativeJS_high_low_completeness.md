# Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Verify the application contains a button container with "Notes" and "Letters" buttons.
- **Pass**: The application contains a button container with "Notes" and "Letters" buttons as seen in the `App.tsx` file.

### Step 2: Verify the application renders piano keys for both natural and sharp notes.
- **Pass**: The application renders piano keys for both natural and sharp notes. The `whiteKeys` and `blackKeys` arrays in `App.tsx` define the keys, and they are rendered in the return statement of the `App` component.

### Step 3: Verify clicking on a piano key plays the correct sound and highlights the key.
- **Pass**: The `handleMouseDown` function in `App.tsx` calls `genericPlay`, which plays the correct sound and highlights the key by adding the `piano-key-active` class.

### Step 4: Verify releasing the mouse button or moving the cursor out of the key stops the sound and removes the highlight.
- **Pass**: The `handleMouseUp` and `handleMouseOut` functions in `App.tsx` call `genericReset`, which stops the sound and removes the highlight by removing the `piano-key-active` class.

### Step 5: Verify pressing and releasing keyboard keys play and stop the corresponding piano notes.
- **Pass**: The `handleKeyDown` and `handleKeyUp` functions in `App.tsx` handle keyboard events to play and stop the corresponding piano notes.

### Step 6: Verify clicking the "Notes" button displays note names on the keys.
- **Pass**: Clicking the "Notes" button sets `isLetters` to `false`, which removes the `letters` class from the `piano` div, thus displaying note names on the keys.

### Step 7: Verify clicking the "Letters" button displays letter names on the keys.
- **Pass**: Clicking the "Letters" button sets `isLetters` to `true`, which adds the `letters` class to the `piano` div, thus displaying letter names on the keys.

### Step 8: Verify the fullscreen button toggles fullscreen mode for the application.
- **Pass**: The `handleFullscreen` function in `App.tsx` toggles fullscreen mode for the application when the fullscreen button is clicked.

### Step 9: Verify the application correctly handles simultaneous multiple key presses.
- **Pass**: The `playedRef` state in `App.tsx` ensures that multiple keys can be pressed simultaneously without interference.
