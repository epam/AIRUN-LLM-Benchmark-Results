# Evaluation Report

### Step 1: Check that a loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched.
**Pass**: The code includes a loading state (`loading`) and displays a loading indicator (`<div>Loading...</div>`) while data is being fetched.

### Step 2: Verify that the loader does not hide the search input when data is loading.
**Fail**: The search input is only rendered after the loading state is set to false. The search input should be visible even when the data is loading.

### Step 3: Validate that a request with an empty search term is sent on the initial render.
**Pass**: On initial render, the `fetchCharacters` function is called, which fetches data from the API without any search term.

### Step 4: Verify that the search input field is present.
**Pass**: The search input field is present in the JSX (`<input type="text" placeholder="Search characters" ... />`).

### Step 5: Ensure that the character search functionality is implemented.
**Pass**: The character search functionality is implemented using the `useEffect` hook that filters characters based on the search term.

### Step 6: Ensure that the API request includes the search term as a query parameter.
**Fail**: The API request does not include the search term as a query parameter. The search is performed on the client side after fetching all characters.

### Step 7: Validate that the data is loading on initial app load with empty query and then when the search term changes.
**Pass**: The data is loaded on initial app load, and the search term changes trigger the filtering of characters.

### Step 8: Ensure that the debounced fetch function prevents unnecessary API requests.
**Pass**: The debounced search function (`setTimeout` with 300ms delay) prevents unnecessary filtering operations.

### Step 9: Confirm that the character list is updated based on the search results.
**Pass**: The character list is updated based on the search results stored in `filteredCharacters`.

### Step 10: Validate that the application handles API request errors.
**Pass**: The application handles API request errors using a try-catch block and logs the error to the console.

### Step 11: Ensure that the user experience remains smooth without backend overloads.
**Pass**: The debounced search functionality ensures a smooth user experience without overloading the backend.
