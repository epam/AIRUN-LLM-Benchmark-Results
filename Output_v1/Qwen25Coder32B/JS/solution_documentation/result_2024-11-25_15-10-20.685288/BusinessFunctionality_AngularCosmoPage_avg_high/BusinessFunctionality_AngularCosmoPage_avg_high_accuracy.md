# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps

1. **Ensure that the application uses `$resource` objects for RESTful API communication.**
   - **Pass**: The application uses `$resource` objects for RESTful API communication, which is evident from the description of the RESTful API integration.

2. **Verify that the application saves page changes to local storage.**
   - **Pass**: The application saves changes to local storage to prevent data loss if the user navigates away, as mentioned in the functionality section.

3. **Confirm that the application initializes the page type correctly.**
   - **Pass**: The application initializes the page type correctly when creating or editing a page, as described in the user interaction section.

4. **Validate that the application manages local storage for unsaved changes.**
   - **Pass**: The application manages local storage for unsaved changes, ensuring that users do not lose their work.

5. **Verify that the application handles errors during saving or updating pages.**
   - **Pass**: The application includes basic error handling for API calls, which is important for maintaining a good user experience.

6. **Confirm that the application broadcasts events to update page variables and settings when necessary.**
   - **Pass**: The application broadcasts events to update page variables and settings, ensuring that the UI reflects the current state.

7. **Validate that the application uses promises and callbacks for asynchronous operations.**
   - **Pass**: The application uses asynchronous operations (promises) for API calls, which is good for performance as it does not block the UI thread.

8. **Validate that the application broadcasts notifications for various operations (e.g., page saving, updating, deleting).**
   - **Pass**: The application broadcasts notifications for various operations, keeping the user informed about the status of their actions.

9. **Verify that the application supports scalability and maintainability through modular design.**
   - **Pass**: The application is structured in a modular way, which makes it easier to scale and maintain.

10. **Confirm that the application optimizes performance through efficient API usage and local storage management.**
    - **Pass**: The application optimizes performance through efficient API usage and local storage management, although additional optimizations may be necessary as the application grows.
