# Evaluation Report

### Evaluation Steps:

1. **Confirm the validation rules, such as name length, valid email address, and minimum password length.**
   - **Pass**: The provided code includes synchronous validation for name length, email format, and password length.

2. **Verify the existence of API endpoints (`api.isName`, `api.isEmail`, `api.signup`) for validation and signup processes.**
   - **Pass**: The code assumes the existence of these API endpoints for validation and signup processes.

3. **Check the use of `redux-form` for managing form state and validation.**
   - **Pass**: The code uses `redux-form` for managing form state and validation.

4. **Ensure the presence of UI components from `react-bootstrap` and custom components like `FormGroup` and `Icon`.**
   - **Pass**: The code assumes the presence of `react-bootstrap` and custom components like `FormGroup` and `Icon`.

5. **Confirm that asynchronous validation is performed in parallel using `Promise.all`.**
   - **Pass**: The code performs asynchronous validation in parallel using `Promise.all`.

6. **Verify the efficient management of form state with `redux-form`.**
