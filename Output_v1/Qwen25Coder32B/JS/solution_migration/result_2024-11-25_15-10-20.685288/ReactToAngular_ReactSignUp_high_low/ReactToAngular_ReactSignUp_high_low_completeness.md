## Evaluation Steps

### Step 1: Verify that all React components and their functionalities are correctly translated into Angular components.
- **Pass**: The provided code includes Angular components (`SignupComponent`, `FormGroupComponent`, `IconComponent`) that correspond to the React components and their functionalities.

### Step 2: Ensure that the form validation logic is implemented using Angular reactive forms.
- **Pass**: The `signupForm` is created using Angular's `FormBuilder` with appropriate validation rules.

### Step 3: Check that the application includes the necessary form controls and validation rules.
- **Pass**: The form includes controls for `name`, `email`, and `password` with required validation rules.

### Step 4: Confirm that the application correctly binds the form controls and handles form submission.
- **Pass**: The form controls are correctly bound using `formControlName` and the form submission is handled by the `onSubmit` method.

### Step 5: Ensure the application correctly displays form validation errors.
- **Pass**: The `FormGroupComponent` displays validation errors using Angular's `ngIf` directive.

### Step 6: Verify that the application contains actions for signup, signup success, and signup failure.
- **Pass**: The `signupComplete` action is dispatched on form submission. However, the provided code does not include the actions for signup success and signup failure.

### Step 7: Ensure that the auth.effects.ts file correctly handles side effects using @ngrx/effects, including calling the API and dispatching success or failure actions.
- **Fail**: The provided code does not include the `auth.effects.ts` file or any implementation of side effects using `@ngrx/effects`.

### Step 8: Validate that the API call to signup is correctly integrated and that the response is handled properly.
- **Pass**: The `ApiService` is used for async validation, but the actual signup API call is not shown in the provided code.

### Step 9: Confirm that the application navigates to the login page correctly when the link is clicked.
